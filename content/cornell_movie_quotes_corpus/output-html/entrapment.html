<h1 id="entrapment">entrapment</h1>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Baker. You got it solved?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I was with someone, all right?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: So? This is work.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Hector, I hardly know the guy. Why be impolite
to strangers?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Look at those assholes…</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: If the Vermeer were lying on that table,
they’d toss their doughnuts on it.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Yeh, well, they didn’t insure it, so they don’t
have to solve this. To them it’s a crime. To us it’s 24 mil, less
re-insurance, which is…</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Which is why you’re on this.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: He came in through the window.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: That’s not possib…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: What’s not possible is entry through the doors
or the vents. That would have triggered instant alarm.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: The windows are wired, too.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Only for trauma. They used smart glass, where
the sensors respond to violation of the panel’s integrity.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I think he scaled the wall, popped the frame.
In one piece.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Then, he only had to deal with heat and motion
sensors. They were on 60-second delay, so the owner wouldn’t trigger the
alarm just be walking arou…</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: The pane weighs 200 pounds, the building’s
1100 feet high.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: This particular guy is the best. The best there
ever was.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Popping the frame would trigger the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Here’s how I figured it out…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: No one arranges flowers like that. It was the
draft from the window.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: You said. This particular guy.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Andrew MacDougal.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Why not Houdini? Or Pretty Boy Floyd? Maybe
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Because they couldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: He’s been out of the business. For ten
years.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Maybe not. No one ever proved, hell, even
arrested him, for stealing anything. But we all know he was numero
ichiban for thirty years. Why not forty?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Why? Because of the Bozo switch? Guys have
been copying his pack- rat signature for decades. Maybe the thief wanted
it to look like MacDougal.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: A list of his private collection. Complete to
three acquisitions last Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: No Vermeer. Nothing close.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Don’t be a putz. This is his legitimate
collection, which he buys. Presentable for any search warrant surprise
party.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: What he rips off, he fences. And the money
feeds his portfolio of investments, which are daring, savvy, and
obscenely succesf…</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Oh, I get it. He has no interest in Vermeers,
so that proves he stole one. By that logic, he oughta be a suspect most
of the time.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You love to embarrass yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The auction. Where our client bought the
painting…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire, four weeks
ago.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: So he was there.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Staking it out. Why bid, when you can mark the
buyer, and jack it within the month?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: At this moment, he is winging on JAL flight 307
to Narita, ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the Hotel
Akura, which will include a mixed media collage/oil by Georges Braques,
on which he supposedly has his eye.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: But you know better.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Bet your ass. At Vegas odds.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Research reveals three known fences, still at
large, who are believed to have brokered Vermeers to black market
buyers. Sandrine Palmer is hospitalized in Malta with ovarian
cancer.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The other two. Live in Tokyo.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: And you did all this since 4:30 this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Uh. I’m showing off.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Something of a habit?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You know the alleged value of this piece from
some fucking computer, which has no clue of the price I can turn the
scroll around for in 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: No, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Are you a confederate of my adversaries? Or are
you just stupid.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Virginia Romay…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Gin, actually, Gin Romay. I was named after a
card game.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Or a cheap cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You’re supposed to be charming.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m supposed to be selective.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Art and Antiquities Acquisition Advisor, how
alliterative…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And am I the antiquity?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: In mint condition.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Look, I’ve studied you, I know… pretty
much…everything.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Made your first millions selling scrap metal.
Then, gold mining concessions, gems, art, and lately strategic metals
for new technologies - platinum, zirconium, titanium…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You said. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The cat burglar stories? Why would anyone…with
so much to lose…take those kinds of risks?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You’d have to be. Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I didn’t know Porsche made things like
this.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well, they don’t…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …as a rule.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Recognize that?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: My seller is in Shinjuku, we can go there
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: He wants 4.6 million. I can get it for
three.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: No, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …only it’s not bloody football!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …it’s just that crap Americans call ‘football’,
like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be
one!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Why you’d want to bring that foolishness to
Japan, you’re just pissing your investment down a bungee hole.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals
or prostitution, something stable.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Garbage, perhaps. Or industrial plastics.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: My favorite thing in life. Coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m staying here, what’s your excuse?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Staying here, as well. You are in room…?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Will you send a half-bottle of Chateau d’Yquem
’67 to Room 138, please? And some berries and chocolates for the lady to
enjoy it with.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Actually, I was just across the room, dickering
with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting Spitzweg. Until I
determined the painting was apparently stolen…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Goes against my grain. The DeKooning in your
slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3. Can you get it for 2 and a
half?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: My checkbook is in my safe. You wait here.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Okay. I’ll wait here.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: That’s my purse.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Just want to see if I’m with the person you say
you are. Can’t be too caref…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: These are my papers, passport, car
registration. If the police arri…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You’re going to need stitches, let me get you
to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Really, this can all wait. I’ll handle it.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That’s actually. Very sweet.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Mr. MacDougal? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Uh. Mr. Ma…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: My God, more females?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I was worried, it’s been twenty…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Eighteen, actually. The leg is fine, but I got
sort of…woozy.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Woozy.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Lost my stomach once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m an old man. You probably noticed.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You should see me without my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ah. Mustn’t forget to zip up.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Odd place, this.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What do you suppose they make here? Video
recorders?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Microchips, I think, for computers.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Bad investment. The best ones are here
today…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Gone tomor…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: This isn’t the way to my sel…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Mind telling me why?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You can’t get it for me at 2.5, can you?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Well, we can tr…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You were setting me up. The correct price is
2.8. You conspire with the seller to start at 4.6, so I’ll be grateful
when you ‘bargain’ him down to three. Close enough to fool some people.
unfortunately…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m old. I know what everything is worth.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: So where are we g…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I am going to the airport. You are going on to
the rest of your life. Which…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …should be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You forgot your lugg…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The hotels deal with that. The things I need
are always waiting at the next one. I don’t carry. Baggage.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Sensible. And you’re off to…?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Oh, that’s highly personal.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I did so hope to impress you.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Young lady. I am old enough to be your
grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Here. A reward.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: A reward for what?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: For not being old. After all.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You mean. Not as old as I look.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Do I deserve a reward?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: It’s so hard to find good casual sex, anymore.
I’m probably out of practice.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What’s hard to find. Is someone you truly want
to be with.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Even for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: It’s lucky we stopped by my room, for the
wine.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Otherwise, we’d never have found my bag was
stolen. Until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Would that make it more stolen?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: They even got my prescriptions.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Something you need? There are all-night
chemists…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I take Prilosec. For stomach acid. And an
inhaler. For asthma.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: But since I didn’t have to work all that hard
tonight…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Why would someone steal my luggage? Every guest
in this place must have more than a wannabe art dealer.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ah. Maybe the thief thought you had something
valuable in there.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Such as…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well. Wannabe dealers make excellent
fences.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: He thought I had a stolen painting. In my
bag.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m joking, of course.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The Vermeer wouldn’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Why, did you do something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You said. Vermeer.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The most famous painting stolen this week.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: If you don’t keep up on your craft. You’ll miss
all the jokes.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m so glad I didn’t leave Tokyo.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I love a guy who knows how to sweet talk.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: There was a call. While you were sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: An art dealer I know. He has a Monet. Minor,
but it is Giverny. He’ll let me have it for 5.3 million.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’d like you to go down there, and pick up the
painting. If that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: If I’m there, he’ll haggle. You just hand him
the debit card, with that…luminous smile. And say, take it or leave
it.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Oh, dear. I thought you so wanted to make a
good impression.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Thought I already did th…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And along with making an excellent impression.
You will also make 2 percent of the purchase price.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That’s $92,000. And change.. For two hours
work.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Any problems. Just give me a ring.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Stolen painting is it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: If it was. I wouldn’t pay more than three.</p>
<p><strong>mac’s recorded voice</strong>: You have reached the
voice-mail of AMD Investments. And, yes, you are at the right place.</p>
<p><strong>okati</strong>: You doin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I think there’s some mista…</p>
<p><strong>okati</strong>: You from Mac?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m from Mac.</p>
<p><strong>okati</strong>: Lemme see card.</p>
<p><strong>okati</strong>: Four million, six hundred thirteen thousand,
five hundred?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Now bring me the real one.</p>
<p><strong>okati</strong>: This as real as it gets, lady.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You got it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Turn it over.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Is there an envelope? Taped to the back? In a
Ziploc bag?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Detach the bag. Read what’s in it. Aloud.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Papers back in the envelope, envelope back in
the Ziploc, very quickly, without seeming to hurry…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Now take the debit card from your purse,
slipping the Ziploc into the purse as you do it, shielding the move from
everyone in the room but Okati.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Now. Hand him the card, and tell him in
Japanese to pretend he is checking it by phone. Tell him to take awhile,
as if he’s on hold.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: While he’s checking, look around the room
casually, as if searching for the cheesy handbags…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: All the while laughing, as if you are chatting
with someone you actually like.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: As you’re looking around, do you notice any
m…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Call out cheerily to Okati, in English,
‘Where’s the toilet?’</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Wing it.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Get going. Now.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’ve got what we bought, are you out of their
sight?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Run into the men’s toilet. I know you know
how.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Jump.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The window, twit!</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I guess you’re gonna explain all this, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Dry clothes, you’ll need them. In five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m supposed to change? Here??</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I won’t look. Gentleman’s word of hon…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: There are a million sailors!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ve seen you naked. Give the boys a
thrill.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You probably won’t be dating any of them, so
what the hell.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Found ’em in your room. Perhaps the thief
wasn’t your size.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We have a business appointment. In four
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Business, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Uh. Am I gonna like th…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And now that I’ve told you. I’ll have to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Or…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …you can spend the most interesting three weeks
of your life. Training.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Training for wha…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …followed by the most exciting night of your
life. After which, you can walk away with 20 million untraceable
dollars…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …which will come in handy. Things being what
they are.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: From now on. You can valet park.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: And if I refuse?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I mean, you won’t really kill me, I’m far too
adorable.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Last night, at Fujitsu, I did some business.
While you thought I was in the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: What could you possibly steal in 18 min…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Thirty-five super-microchips. Each worth one
million dollars. And change.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You hate round num…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I stole your suitcase when I left you at the
bar. I have since sent it on to the States, with three chips, well
hidden.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Since you aren’t there to claim it, the bag
will sit at Customs. Safe. Unless…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: They receive. An anonymous. Tip.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: That’s entrapment.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: No, entrapment is what cops do to robbers.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Blackmail. Is what robbers do to schmucks.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Pop quiz.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Admit it’s a rush. The best day of your
heretofore drab life.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …accompanied by related foreplay.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Nickerson Carlsby, Mr… MacDuff, yes?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Banquo MacDuff. This is my associate-fiancee,
Ms. Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: That is…fiancee and assoc…</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: Well, it’s a pleasure, in this alien place,
to do business with a countryman.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m a Scot. It’s a different country.
Culturally and historically.</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: Five feet thick with hidden rein-
forcements, no way to drill through!</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: Only the tip of our security iceberg. See
these two Brinks locks…?</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: The Captain keeps one key. The other is
continually forwarded: to the Chief of Security at next port. There is
no way to enter during voyage.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I like this.</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: The best armed guard, rotated every six
hours. A redundancy, of course, but we would rather be safe three times
over than merely two.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Sound mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: Sprinklers. New design. Incredible power.
The entire chamber is water- proof, fireproof, airtight. If the ship
sinks, God forfend, your cargo is secure for salvage.</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: And your cargo is…?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Wine.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The bloody Japs bought up half the premium
clarets in the universe. You may have heard.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m in charge of shipping some 14,000 bottles,
most quite rare, to a number of premium hotels in Hong Kong, Bangkok,
Singapore, Phuket, and Penang.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: All of which are destinations on your October
voyage. Five months from now. However…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Wine. Doesn’t prefer. To be jostled.</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: Our ‘delicate treasure’ platforms,
suspended on gimbals. Your cargo remains unruffled by roiling seas.
Then, on arrival, is plucked…</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: By that forklift, and gently deposited on
dock through the cargo hatch…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Adequate. I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Did we see…a bathing pool. On deck?</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: Oh, yes, sir. The Shikoku Maru carries
sixteen luxury suite pas- senger cabins. The finest cuisine. For valued
clients who prefer to cruise in privacy.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Mildly. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Adequate. I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: But dearest, in five months, we’ll be in Cape
Town.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Anything sooner? That goes perhaps from…say,
Sri Lanka? To Jakarta.</p>
<p><strong>carlsby</strong>: Why, yes. In three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You seem depressed.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: At your insistence, I’m leaping to my death,
and I don’t know why!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Because. You’re a greedy girl.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m not jumping until you talk about this, it’s
been two days!</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Why are we going in three weeks, if the wine is
on a different route months lat…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: There is no wine. That just bought us a look at
their security.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I knew that.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What we want is on the boat in three weeks. Now
can we jump?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The machine in those diagrams. on the back of
the painting.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: What does it do, make gold?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We’re nearing the targ…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Why won’t you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: How do I know who you are, hmmn?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: For all I know, your name isn’t Virginia Romay.
Maybe you’re a cop.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Why would a cop do all th…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: One…two…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Mac, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Of you.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Consistent. And rather impressive.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: All right, six and seven…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Three and four…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: What the hell are we building?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: A chalet, I think. Or an outhouse.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Forty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Get your fucking equipment together, man, this
is a professional operation!!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: This time, when you raise your arm. Don’t
breathe.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Very, very nice. Had a tour with the Mosad, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Where does this fit in the game plan?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Oh, it doesn’t. But one never knows…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You might need it with me.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: This one, I will not get!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: But you will, you’ll get it all. You are
actually…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Quite remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Take the rest of the evening off.</p>
<p><strong>overlapping voices</strong>: …told you it’s not a good time
f…either, personally, I’ve never liked h…Giants’ pitching, once ag…late,
you want the Chronicle or don’t y…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Webber Assurance.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: This is oh-four-six-one. Hector Cruz, please,
on a secure line.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Please hold.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Go ahead, please.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Thank y…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …no way I’m telling you shit.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Baker, this is an extremely dangerous g…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …right now, you’re more dangerous than he
is.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: You want to explain th…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: If I tell you what this is, and where this is,
you’ll send back-up, and those morons will blow my cover, and I’ll be
too dead to accept your apology.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: You’re fucking him, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Right to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: You’re over your head, Baker.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Only romantically. I’ll write to him in
prison.</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: Okay, it’s your funeral. Next time I see you,
I owe you a spanking.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Ooooo. Is that a promise?</p>
<p><strong>cruz</strong>: While you’re on secure, do you want a
transfer?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Nope. I’m headed back to the hot tub. I’ll call
again, if I’m in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m freezing my tender parts.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m relieved to hear you have some.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What’s amazing, is that only eleven workers
died during construction of this thing…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Of course, the others were saved by a safety
net.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I never liked you.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: One act of fucking human kindness…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Call it a lapse.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: And how does this fit into the game pl…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Oh, it doesn’t. We came for the view.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: To Ginger Baker.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m partial to drummers. If they played with
Clapton and Winwood.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The prescription bottle. When you stole my
suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Armand Baker was my husband, May 13 to October
27, 1982, he played alto sax, I was 17 years old.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: He named me Ginger. He likes drummers, too.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And you get sentimental for him. Every time you
order drugs.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I have I.D. in that name. I use it for various
things I don’t want traced. When credit unions turn their computers my
way.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I could listen to you lie all night.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Do you like diamonds?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You asked. Does the machine. Make gold.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Gold is shit. It’s six thousand dollars a
pound. Worth your weight in gold…?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That would put you at seven hundred
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Would you pay it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: When the light hits you just right. I’d pay
more.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The machine. That we are stealing. Makes
diamonds?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Real ones?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Gem quality. First ever. God save Japan.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: A diamond reactor takes graphite, runs it
through a combination of lasers, electron beams, and scanning- tunnel mg
microscopes.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: This one uses krypton-fluorine laser, with a
new isotope of krypton.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The atoms are rearranged. And the molecule of
graphite becoznes a molecule of…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I hate it. When you make a point.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: All right, then. All set.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: We will keep your passports in our safe
until Jakarta.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: You are Suite 16…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …and never been kissed.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We had booked Suite 9.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: 16 is our Tokugawa Suite, far superior,
trust me.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: You luggage is in the room, these are your
keys, the housekeeper will show you t…</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: I’d be on board in forty minutes. Just to
be safe.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Down there. Ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Are you dumping fuel?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Changed my mind. There’s nothing on the
instruments downrange. The longer she flies before she ditches, the less
chance they notice on the Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You should lose the oxygen tank at 8000
feet.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: And how do I judge that? Babe’s intuition?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: So I just ask you on the way down? Or were you
planning to e-mail me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I hate a crybaby.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s over, it’s over…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Catch your breath, quickly. Hang on for the
wake.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: If I were you, I’d watch the desserts.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Boy, I’ll bet you were in shape before you got
old.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Too long ago to remember.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I can take it from here, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: If you’d packed my primary chute right, I
wouldn’t ha…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Yes, you would. You’re a girl.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Anytime you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Better angle.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You might want to move aside…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: May I trouble you for the torch? Or would you
rather just dance.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I know I packed it.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Coal into diamonds. A wealth machine.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: How do you know that’s it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Hmmn?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m just finishing your sentence. Can’t you
answer a question with- out making me feel stupid?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Why would I bother?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Okay, it was a dumb ques…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Let’s get one thing straight. I don’t work with
partners much, because basically, I find most people to be idiots.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You, in contrast, are first-rate.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And if I think so. Maybe you should start
thinking the same. Now move your ass.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: GPS transponder. Sends a scrambled signal by
satellite…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Precise coordinates. You could find a golf ball
in the Gobi Desert.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Where you g…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: That’s my assignm…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Finish up on the floaters.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Won’t they hear it?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Over these engines? Through five feet of
steel?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Hell, if they do, they don’t have the second
key to get in.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Thank God for redundant security.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: How many tries do I get?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You gotta work on that impatient streak.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Uh. Thing on the left is the brakes?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: JUMP, for God’s sa…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You did activate the floaters.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Activa…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I did say, ‘Finish up on the floaters’. Surely,
you heard me.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Well…I saw our suction things.
Lying…over…there?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Or maybe. I put ’em there.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I like a quick study.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …no matter how many stones we make, the
diamonds are just an appetizer.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: My contract. With DeBeers.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Oh my G…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Sensible folks, DeBeers. A world monopoly in
diamonds based on one simple principle…something’s only priceless if
it’s scarce.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: These guys dig up all the diamonds on the
planet, just to keep them out of circulation. Otherwise, you could buy
’em at the Five and Dime…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Watch the old guy stuff, they don’t have
dimestores anym…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Imagine the chaos we could cause.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You said ‘contract’…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We’re sort of bounty hunters.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Our machine is worth far more dead. Than
alive.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Glad to see you’re both alive.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: When you missed cocktails. And supper. I
thought of knocking on your door…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Oh, I wish you had. We love having strangers
join us! Maybe later…?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Promise you an interesting time…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Or my name’s not Banquo MacDuff.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …well, I would ask what you’re doing with the
rest of your life. But that’s your own bloody affair, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Yeh. Anyway, before you get too choked up on
the farewell. I feel I owe you a confession.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Time has come to tell you. What business. I’m
actually in.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It only looks dangerous…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You couldn’t fall off. Unless someone threw you
over.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: More intimate. For a confession.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What business. You are actually. In.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Yeh. I’m not an art dealer.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Of course not. You’re a cop.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: An insurance investigator for Webber Assurance,
your boss is an idiot named Hector Cruz, you’ve been there four years
and ten months, you’re quite the rising star.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’m a thief, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: For five years, I’ve used the database of every
client Webber has to plan my jobs. Museums, banks, jewelers, rich
people, I have floor plans, alarm codes, passwords, the works.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’ve made a fortune. It’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Why n…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Why wasn’t it enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The Vermeer that was stolen from Hancock Tower?
That was my job. I scaled the building with electromagnets, and
parachuted down an air vent…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …after mailing the painting. To where we’re
going next, actua…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Yeh, we. You passed the audition.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I need a partner. For the biggest, smartest,
job. Ever. The one you retire off of, because nothing else could ever
compare with the rush.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ever. Is such a long time.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: This is a job that can only be done in one
place, in one split-second in human history. If we miss that instant. We
lose.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And it’s worth…?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Eight billion dollars. That’s eight thousand
million.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: How much in shillings?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You’re not a real trusting guy.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And I tried so hard to hide that.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: It’s two jobs. The first steals something
priceless from the National Palace Museum in Taipei. We don’t keep that.
We trade it in for our ticket to the show.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: One moment in time, you s…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Midnight, July 1, 1997. Eight days from now.
The moment that Hong Kong is annexed by china.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: 80-20 split.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Don’t be so hard on yourself. It’s your plan,
you should take at least thirty perc…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: My 80, your 20. Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: 50-50. Or you can swim to Taipei.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What are you gonna do with six billion dollars
that you can’t do with four?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Hold the record. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Your share is 50%. And one dollar.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I like what you left. In the hold.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You didn’t even see wha…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: A lump of coal. A pair of pliers. A note that
said, ‘Squeeze hard’.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Squeeze hard.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: That’s Madame Chiang Kaishek, she’s my bud. An
evil streak a mile wide.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: No surprise.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I have a lot on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You look beautiful doing it.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You wanna buy a Vermeer?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Rather steal it.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Been there, done that.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan.
Repository of four thousand years of Chinese culture…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx, pots and
scrolls, paintings and porcelains and lacquer work. Every treasure the
Kuomintang could loot before the Reds took over. Ever rob the place?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: No. If memory serves.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You need to eat something, or are you ready for
sex?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ginny…?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Quite a parting gift. I would have settled for
roses.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: It’s a joke. You know, a joke? People who have
a sense of humor make them?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You’re rich, go buy an American, have him fill
you in on the culture.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ah. American culture. Well, that is a joke.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Nice. When a sky is that.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Is it easier now? Not pretending.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Not pretending you’re an innocent. Not
pretending you…like me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Here’s a tip from an old-timer. Never forget
who you are…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It gives you someone to be. When you stop
pretending.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Because the museum displays 10,000 relics at
any given moment. But there are 60 times that many, stored in the
mountain.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Which is why it’s guarded. By an army.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The train shuttles relics to and from storage.
It looks exactly like that.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I’ve been down the air ducts four times. The
train always has two armed guards. Always travels between 32 and 36
miles per hour. Relics don’t like to be jostled too much.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: We go down the first. Back up the third, if
you’re lucky. If not, we have to get out by the fourth.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Electromagnets, incredibly powerful. This
switch is on-off.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Seems like overkill. For one simple jump.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Well, it’s an eight billion dollar jump. You
miss the train…you’ve missed the train.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: We’ve got five days to grab the Bones, trade
them for the Scan, and pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong. Once
midnight passes on July 1st…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …we’ve missed the train, yeh. The Bones? The
Scan?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Oh. Have I neglected to fill in the
details?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: An oversight.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Which I learned from the master. Hey. Wish me
luck…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Be my fucking guest.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m too old for this shit!</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Know a dude named Wiley Coyote?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Isn’t it easier now? Not pretending?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Five years, you won’t need make-up.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We agreed. No underwear.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Overkill. I can do it with legs.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’d lose the underwear.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The Oracle Bones date back to the Shang
Dynasty, 3500 years ago. They are writings…carved into ox bones,
tortoise shells…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The oldest Chinese writing any- where, the
first proof of Chinese civilization.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What makes this one so valuable?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: When you’re old, you can do anything</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: There we are.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Last year, ancient artifacts were discovered in
the Gulf of Mexico. An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Amazingly, markings on these Olmec figures were
identified as Shang Dynasty writing…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: This particular Bone is price- less, because it
is the one that establishes the link. Proves that American civilizations
descend from Chinese ancestors.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Exactly the kind of propaganda shit they eat up
in Beijing. The mainland would pay anything to get its paws on th…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …no, I don’t think that way.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: …and I suppose you do?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Get lonely? Sure, all the time. It’s
healthy.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: What’s unhealthy. Is denial.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Be real. you could never see yourself…you know,
quitting the game. Settling…down.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Why, Ginger. This is so sudden.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re in charge of ego and worrying. I’m in
charge of keeping you alive.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: These are plasma jet. All the force is directed
forward, instead of dissipating in a sphere like a grenade.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I don’t need th…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You don’t trust me, you won’t get through
this.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Try to adjust to that for three more days.
After July 1…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …you’ll never have to trust again.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Something. To look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: 21 Old Peak Road. In 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Will you please come this way?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I like this.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You like wha…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Not being told what the fuck we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You’re on a ‘need to know’ basis. You’ll get
each step in time to execute, I thought you agreed to those condit…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I trust you. I only need to…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …remain in control.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Which is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I like that, too.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Colonel</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: You look lovely, Ginger. Is the rose for
me?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is Andrew
MacDougal.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Real names here, darling. The Colonel and I
have every incentive to keep each other’s secrets.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: Like the place, Andy?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Please. Mr. MacDougal will do.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: This way. Doesn’t matter if we spill.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: My sentiments exactly.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: This place was a gift. From its former owner. A
Brit whose business will now happily continue to function. Perhaps…even
expand.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: Tho it has required many sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The Colonel has divorced his wife. To
facilitate the necessary entertaining of Western women.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: Tho some are more entertaining than others.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Colonel. You are touching the woman I love…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: From time to time.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: You’re a Scot. Would you like some 25-year-old
Macallan?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Sure, I’ll take a case.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The Colonel told his Minister of Culture that
he could mount a surgical raid to liberate this treasure from
Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ah. How much was the Minister told the raid
would cost?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Which you can now keep.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: He would have paid twice that. But my needs are
modest.</p>
<p><strong>qiu</strong>: Unlike. The woman you love. From time to
time.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: How do I look, honey?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Like a woman. Of mystery.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: In the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building. Is
a room with two computers. One for you. And one for me.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Glad I have a function, here.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The room is a vault on the 14th floor. Access
codes to that room are changed daily, computer pass- words on the hour,
but…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Four men in the world. Don’t need codes. Their
retinas will scan to unlock everything. One of these is China’s Minister
of Finance.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And his retinal plate is in there.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Our trade for the great train robbery. All
right, let’s say we’re in the door. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Hong Kong has a huge portion of its holdings
invested in foreign banks. In hundreds of separate accounts…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: This CD ROM is programmed to send,
instantaneously, thousands of instruc- tions, with all necessary
confirmation codes, to transfer reasonably modest sums out of those
accounts….</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Modest.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Two or three million at a crack, in odd
numbers. Total, eight billion. And change.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And you’ve set up a laundry.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a
series of multiple switches, Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel
Islands, the Caymans…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Thank you. As soon as each deposit lands
somewhere, it’s shot somewhere else, til the Mafia couldn’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: But those first instructions, transferring the
8 billion dollars. They’re recorded in the main computer.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Nope. The CD instructs the computer to erase
the real transactions. And replace them in its memory with an innocuous
loan coded XJ6. Little homage to Limeyland, there.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Dearest. The accounts won’t reconcile.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Wrong. The CD instructs the computer to
over-report all account totals forever, in the exact amounts we’ve
lifted. So the Chinese think the money’s still there.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The money. Is still. Missing.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Sure, the foreign banks know they sent out some
money. But they think Hong Kong knows it, too. And since we’re leaving
plenty in every account…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The shit doesn’t splatter. Until the first
account runs dry.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: And then. Comes the really brilliant part of
the whole thing!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I was hoping there’d be one.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Admit it, so far you’re blown away.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It does sound like the beginning of a beautiful
friendship.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Pity it will be over. In 21 hours.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Bet you say that. To all the
one-night-stands.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: No, ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Only the best of them.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Nice of the Colonel to provide an
invitation…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Well, I promised him a bonus. Five million.
Comes out of your share.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …long as I don’t have to have sex with him.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: So all that time, sitting at your computers.
All the research, the access codes your job allowed you to steal, floor
plans, schematics… setting up all your bank accounts…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Years of work, comes down to…. …six minutes.
Don’t be nervous. Easy come, easy go.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Your share prob’ly works out to, what? Dollar
and a quarter an hour?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The dedication, the skill, the guts…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m going to see you get everything you
deserve.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Woman. If you can’t have fun, right now. You’re
in the wrong business.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Uploading. And you’ve got… two minutes, fifty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: So let’s see. Across town at the British
Consulate…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …everyone is working frantically to complete
transactions before they go off-line at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …then, deep in the high-tech bowels of the Bank
of China Building, just across the square…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …the Chinese are sitting on their thumbs,
waiting to come on-line at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I feel for these boys. Let’s give them a
breather, hmmn?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We’ll let the Brits go off-line 4 seconds
early.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And we’ll give our new Chinese overlords 4
extra seconds of rest before they have to go on-line.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Playing God here, Ginger. We’ve created 8
seconds that do not exist, anywhere but in this room.</p>
<p><strong>local time…11</strong>: 59:00. One minute to midnight.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: 8 seconds, where no one is on-line but your
little CD-Rom.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And when, eventually, everyone discovers what
transaction XJ6 was really about…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: China will think it happened before midnight.
Britain will swear it happened after midnight…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: They’ll each be positive. The other guy. Did
it.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Liable to be an ugly international
incident.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Britain off-line in 18 seconds. We’re
bulletproof.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Baby girl. Nothing. Is bulletproof. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Britain goes bye-bye in 6… 5…4…3.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Feel like a nightcap?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The CD won’t come out of the driver.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Relax, don’t jam it…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Don’t panic, now, there’s no rush…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: We can’t leave it IN THERE, it’s got all our
accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Easy with that, there’s no ru…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: There’s a rush.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The disc. Is still in there.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: We can’t help it, we…we’ve gotta…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: What a guy.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Was wondering where to leave this…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: They don’t know we’re the bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Time they find out.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Okay. How do we get down?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Down? I never liked down.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You can do this.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Okay, now what?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Mac, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Turns out, I’m a screw-up.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well. Something to be said for being
self-aware.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: May I have the last grenade, dear. It’s about
to rain.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You see, banking will be more democratic under
China.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well. No more glass ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: How refreshing. The night air.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You can. If I say so.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: If you stay. You’ll have to pay for the
damage…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Now that split. Did we say 60-40?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Got the keys?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I thought you could…hot-wire stuff?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: They fix those things so you can’t steal
them…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: These, they’re not so worried.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Go grab that hook.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Let me rephrase that. Run and grab that hook.
Or die…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: This only works if you shut your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: You’re not gonna lower me over the side.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Of course not. Now close baby eyes… Suit
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Let go NOW!!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Planning.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: And dumb luck.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: God, I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You ran your calls.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: All the transactions, all the transfers. It’s a
miracle.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Why? The CD erased the trans- actions, all
accounts seem in order. It looks like the thieves were stopped in
time.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The Colonel says police have nothing. A man in
black-tie, a blonde in a gown. The elevator guards saw faces, but no mug
shots to ID. I think it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Except it never is, really. Quite. Over.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Well, one hopes not. The Bristol, huh?
In…Paris?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re not going back to Mr. Cruz, and the
nine-to-five?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Not hardly. I’ve arranged to be killed in a car
crash. On Taipei. Amazing how little it costs.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well. You want to watch those pennies.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I could arrange for two. In that crash.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You know, for a bitch. You can be awfully
sweet.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Woman of mystery. What do you say? I like the
Bristol, just fine. mean, it’s not the Ritz…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You know, all night I’ve been wrestling with
something…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Not the most flattering way to put it.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ve changed your travel plans.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Instead of taking the subway to the airport,
you change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong. Got that?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Jordan is only 90 seconds up the line. Like a
wire transfer, you’re gone. Vanished.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: In this bag are passports, tickets, papers. An
amber wig, a good one. A dress you can slip on in five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re on a tight connection to the
Trans-Siberian Express, be in Europe in a week.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Mac, wh…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Shhh. You always talk too much.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Time has come to return the favor. One last
time.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Tell you. What business. I’m actually in.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: See, my profession was cover, too. A notorious
thief has access to colleagues, their plans…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ve turned in…well, couple hundred. over forty
years. Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Thought I might retire. After you.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: And all the…microchips, the diamond
machine…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well, the chips were returned. The machine was
just a box, did you actually think it was real?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: I thought…everything was real. Stupid girl.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Those were your jobs, so I could have claimed
entrapment. You had to wait. For mine.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: The Oracle Bone…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well, the State Department liked that one. They
have more fish to fry with Beijing than Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: So they’re taking credit for letting it go
through. Tho I’m afraid your Colonel may be in for a career
disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: And the 5 billion.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I haven’t told them.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I said you hadn’t revealed the job. That it
wouldn’t take place until after the changeover.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Don’t look, they’re there.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: And my tickets. In the shopping bag?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well. Kept my options open. If I give you up,
they don’t matter, do they?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: If.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Had lots of crazy thoughts. One was retirement.
With four billion dollars. After all, I know some places where life
could be private…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: But you couldn’t do that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Otherwise. They wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Creature of habit. I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Lots. Of thoughts, you s…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Keep smiling. They won’t move, until I raise my
left arm.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I thought. Well, I’ve got the CD. I could
contact the banks, reverse all the transactions…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …except maybe. Leave you with… oh, a hundred
million, say. To tide you over.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Then, I thought, nah. Not my style.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I figured. What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Let her keep the lot.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: No rush. The doors won’t close for 60
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: There’s a pistol in the bag. Reach in slowly.
Take it out fast. Point it at my temple.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You can do it. If I say you can.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Step onto the car, keep the pistol trained on
my face.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Seems I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Entrapment. Is what robbers. Do to cops,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Twenty seconds. Shoot me in the shoulder, it’ll
slow them down.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: Oughta shoot you in the face.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Come on, you can do it, if I sa…</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: No way. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ten seconds, hold on.</p>
<p><strong>gin</strong>: When do I see you?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Airport. Changing at Mongkok Station, we can
cut her off.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: She might lose the wig, be looking brunette or
blonde, navy pants suit…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: I think Yaumatei changes for the airport, and
it’s closer.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I think you’re wrong, but cover it. You got
maybe four minutes.</p>
