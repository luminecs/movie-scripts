<p><strong>lao</strong>: Dr. Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Lao She.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Nee chin lie how ma?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Wah hung how, nee nah? Wah hwey hung jing
chee jah loo nee kao soo wah shu shu.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: You never told me you spoke my language,
Dr. Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I don’t like to show off.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: For this special occasion, I ordered champagne
and caviar.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: So, it is true, Dr. Jones? you found
Nurhachi?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a
little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: You have insulted my son.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Next time I’ll cut off more than his
finger.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Dr. Jones – I want Nurhachi.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: As I recall the deal was consid- erably
more.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Aren’t you going to introduce us?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: This is Willie Scott. And this is Indiana
Jones, the famous archaeologist.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well – I thought archaeologists were always
funny little men searching for their mummies – Aaahhh!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Put the gun away, sonny.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Now I suggest you pay me what you promised
– or your girlfriend here is going to be squealing a new tune.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Try again Lao – the deal was more.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look at this! He put a hole in my dress from
Paris!</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just
drank the rest of it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This Nurhachi’s a very small guy.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Inside are the remains of Nur- hachi – the
first Emperor of the Manchu Dynasty.</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: At last I have the ashes of my sacred
ancestor!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: So, what’s the big deal? Let me see it –</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: You fool!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Ow, you’re hurting me, you miser- able
little hood!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Let go of her, Lao. And give me the
antidote.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hey, he’s not a waiter…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No, Wu Han’s an old friend I brought along.
So, the game’s not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Wu Han – listen to me – I’m going to get
you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>wu han</strong>: Not this time, my friend… I followed you on
many adventures – but into the great Unknown Mystery, I go first,
Indy…</p>
<p><strong>lao</strong>: Don’t be sad, Dr. Jones – you will soon join
him.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The antidote – !</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Look out, damn it, I need that
antidote!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who cares? Where’s that diamond!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Excuse me, but I believe that’s my
diamond!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Aw nuts!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Hey,doll! Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Step on it, Short Round!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Okey doke, Indy! Hold onto your
potatoes!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: For crying out loud, a kid’s driv- ing the
car?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Relax, I’ve been giving him lessons.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Listen, we just met for crissake! I’m not
that kind of gril!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Don’t get your hopes up – where’s the
antidote?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You don’t look very good.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Poison never agrees with me. Pull a right,
Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Check! Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look at what you’ve done to me! I’m a mess!
My lipstick’s smeared, I broke two nails, I’ve got an aw- ful run in my
stocking – !</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Somehow I think you’ve got bigger
problems.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’re we going to do?! Where’re we
going?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The airport…No, look out, Short Round!
Left, left!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You got the tickets, Short Round?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Sure, Indy – three tickets! You, me and
Wu Han –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Wu Han’s not coming, Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Don’t worry, Indy. Short Round number
one bodyguard now!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ll take the extra ticket. Where’s this
plane going anyway?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Siam.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Siam? But I’m not dressed for Siam…</p>
<p><strong>weber</strong>: No, no, they’re all right! Let them through
please.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Thanks, Weber.</p>
<p><strong>weber</strong>: Dr. Jones, this is positively the last time
our airline can hold a plane for you. Now you must hurry!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: So, what’re you supposed to be, a lion
tamer?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Since I was nice enough to let you tag
along, why don’t you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m freezing. What do you mean, tag along?
From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven’t been able to
keep your eyes off me.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Lao send planes to kill Indy!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Wake up! It’s the drug he drank to stop the
poison –</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Please to remain calm. We start passing
out parachutes now –</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You got to be kidding! No! No, I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>kao kan</strong>: Jones! Indiana Jones!</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Put it on! What’s wrong with you? You’ve
got to jump!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: No, can’t leave Indy!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Give me that parachute, I changed my mind
–</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: No, this last one! It’s for Indy!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We there yet?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: There’s nobody flying the plane!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Come here, lady, hold this and shut up
please!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: I get it!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You got it!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Oh oh – big mistake!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Short Round, what in the hell are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We’re not
sinking, we’re crashing!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come
on, grab onto me tight!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Okay, Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No… I’m not cut out for the kind of life you
lead. Oh no…I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: India…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Holy cow – India? How do you know we’re in
–</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He told me they knew I was coming here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What do you mean – how?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The old man saw it in a dream.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Dream – nightmare is more like it.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He said that’s whey they were at river –
they were waiting for the plane to fall down.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I hope this means we’re going to get some
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: God, I am starving, but I can’t eat
this…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s more food than these people eat in a
week. They’re starving, too…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m sorry, I – here, please.</p>
<p><strong>chieftain</strong>: You will rest here before you go on.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We’d appreciate that. This was an
unexpected detour. We’ll have to go to Delhi now and find a flight
west.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy is taking me to America.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m a professor. I have to re- turn to the
university. Can you give us a guide to take us to Delhi?</p>
<p><strong>chieftain</strong>: Sanju will guide you.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: On the way to Delhi, you will stop at
Pankot.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Pankot isn’t on the way to Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: You will go to palace there.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Hasn’t the Pankot palace been de- serted
since the Mutiny of 1857?</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: No. Now there is new Maharajah – and palace
is powerful again.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I don’t understand. What’s hap- pened
here?</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: The evil starts in Pankot. Then like
monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What evil?</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: They came from Palace and took sivalinga
from out village.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Took what?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s a sacred stone in a shine that’s
supposed to protect a village.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: It is why Krishna brought you here.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed.
We were shot down by –</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the
stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky – so you can got to
Pankot Palace. To find siva- linga – and bring back to us.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy, they make out plane crash? To get
you here?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s just superstition, Shorty. Like a
ghost story.</p>
<p><strong>chieftain</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Was the stone very smooth? It was probably
brought here from a sacred river.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: Long ago – before my father’s father.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: And it had three lines painted across it?
The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I’ve seen stones
like the one you lost.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I don’t understand how losing one rock could
destroy this village. Is it really powerful?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: But why would the Maharajah take this
sacred stone?</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: They say we must pray to their evil god. We
say we will not.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He says that when the sacred stone was
taken the village wells dried up first and then the river stopped.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He says their crops dies and then the
animals died.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: And then they took their children.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Their children?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He says one night there was a fire in the
fields. The men went to fight it. When they came back, they heard the
women crying in the darkness. And the children were gone.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: You will find them when you find
sivlalinga.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t know how I can help you
here.</p>
<p><strong>chieftain</strong>: They do not listen.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I have friends in Delhi and I will make
sure they investigate this…</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: No, you will got to Pankot…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’d he say now?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It was destined that I came here – and the
future cannot be changed…</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Sankara…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Sankara…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Damn it , Willie, get on – we’ve got to
move out!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Whoa! Easy now – nice elephant…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: I ride with you, Indy?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Nope, you got a little surprise over there,
Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Oh boy!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This is the first time anybody ever cried
when I left.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: They don’t cry about you. They cry
about the elephants leaving.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Figures…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: They got no food to feed them. So they
taking the elephants away to sell them.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: All right, let’s go. I want to get to
Pankot before tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Pankot?! I thought we were going to Delhi!
Hey, wait a minute! Can’t somebody take me to Delhi?! I don’t want to go
to Pankot!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I think you need this more than me.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Here you go, lunch time!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Those are very big bird.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Those aren’t birds – those are giant
bats.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They must be pretty dumb to drink that
awful-looking water.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I think maybe we’ll camp here.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Hey, Willie – I think you better get out
now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Stark naked? You wish… If you’re trying to
seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Me seduce you? Honey, you’re the one who
took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never
know what else might be in the water.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Somehow I feel safer in here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Indy! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m coming in! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A snake!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: A what…?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Uh, listen – Willie – I got a better
idea.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: First of all – don’t panic!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s got me ! Indy, help me!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Don’t let it pull you deeper!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s pulling me deeper!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Don’t let it curl around you!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s curling around me! Damn it, stop
talking and do something!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you
now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Can you move your arm?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Just one arm!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Okay, I want you to lift your hand – and
pet the snake.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary
and precaudal verte- brae.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh – my – god – it’s going to crush me!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Keep stroking it!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s starting to let go!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s good – you’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s letting fo. I think it’s – I think it’s
going to sleep!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: See – I got you out…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I know the feeling…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: You come to America with me, and we can
get job in the circus – you like that?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Where’d you find your little body-
guard?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I met Short Round when he tried to pick my
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He’ll be okay. He’s a good kid.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: By the way, how’d you end up in
Shanghai?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, when my nightclub career was run over
by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that “a girl could go
places in the Orient…” So, look where I got.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What about the future?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, that’s easy – I’m going to latch onto a
good-looking, in- credibly rich prince.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’d like to find one of those myself.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yeah, but he’s got to be dead and buried
for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is that what you’re hoping to find at this
palace, Dr. Jones?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Something that kid gave me last night. It’s
a piece of an old manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What does the writing say?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s Sanskrit. It tells the story of
Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: That’s Shiva? What’s he giving the
Priest?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and
combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical
powers.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You mean magical like the rock that was
stolen from that village?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It could be.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Fortune and glory…sweet dreams,
Dr. Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I think you should sleep closer. I meant
for safety.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’d be safer sleeping with that snake.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Did you see it?! It was one of those bats!
God, what else is out there…?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Couldn’t keep away, huh?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Just try and control yourself.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Still scared? Okay, Willie, you can get
closer if you want…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Honey, I knew you’d be the first one to
give in…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy, look!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s it. Pankot Palace.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why are we stopping here?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: What you look at, Indy?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Just a statue.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s the guide talking about? He hasn’t
said a word the whole trip.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He’s afraid of something.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He said he couldn’t take us any farther. He
has to go sell the elephants.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You mean we have to walk the rest of the
way?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: – shot at, fallen out of a plane, nearly
drowned, squashed by a snake, attacked by a bat – I smell like an
elephant! I tell you I’m not going to make it!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Any more complaints?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, I wish you’d thought of this
sooner…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It doesn’t feel like there’s been any
permanent damage.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Hello?……</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hi………</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: I would say you look rather lost. But
then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at
home…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Lost? No, we’re not lost. We’re on our way
to Delhi. This is Miss Scott – and Mr. Round. My name’s Indiana
Jones.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Dr. Jones? The eminent archae-
ologist?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hard to believe, isn’t it…?</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: I remember first hearing your name when
I was studying at Oxford. I Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His
Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How’d you like to run into him in a dark
alley…that one’s kind of cute…I could see myself married to a prince
like that…</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: The plane crash and your journey here
sound – most incredible.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You should have been there…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We’d appreciate it if the Mahara- jah would
let us stay tonight. We’ll be on out way in the morn- ing.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: I am only his humble servant, but the
Maharajah usually listens to my advice.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the
present Maharajah’s late father.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh – good. And maybe the pres- ent Marahajah
is a little younger? And thinner?</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: They will escort you to your rooms now.
You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with
His Highness.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is
changing. But look at me – my god, I’ve to to get ready!</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Eight o’clock in the Pleasure
Pavilion.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You look like a princess.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s sort of like being in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’ve always had a weakness for folk
dancing.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: She might get away with that act here, but
she’d never make it in a real nightclub.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: We are fortunate tonight to have some
many unexpected guests. his is Captain Phillip Blumburtt.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Just a routine inspection tour.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: The British worry so about their Emprie
– it makes us feel like well-cared-for children.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the
Maharajah’s wife?</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: His Highness has not yet taken a
wife.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No? Well, I guess he just hasn’t met the
right woman…</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Interested in local curios?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No. But I am interested in the occult. And
this is a krtya.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s like the voodoo dolls of West Africa.
The kryta represents your enemy – and gives you complete power over
him.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: That God all that mumbo jumbo
rubbish is disappearing.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Of course. Admittedly, it’s taken
time. Britian’s controlled India for almost two hundred eyars now.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You’re hanging on better here than you did
in America.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: This is a different situation,
Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly
into the twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The Prime Minister doesn’t seem that
naive.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: No, he’s a very shrewd old boy.
Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole
province.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I think this Maharajah is swim- ming in
money. Maybe coming here wasn’t such a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: I believe we’re being called to
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Finally!</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: His Supremem Highness, guardian of
Rajput tradition – the Maharajah of Pankot – Zalim Singh.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: That’s the Maharajah – that kid?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Maybe he likes older women.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Cheer up, you lost your prince, but
dinner’s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ve never been so hungry in my life…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: My god, sort of grusome, isn’t it…?</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: His Highness wants me to welcome his
visitors. Especially the renowned Dr. Jones from America.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We are honored to be here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Suddenly I’m not so hungry…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini- ster. I
was examining some of the Maharajah’s artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: A very fine collection of very old
pieces, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces
look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the
Thuggees to worship the god- des Kali.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Dr. Jones, you know very well that the
Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Of course. The Thuggees were an
obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The Brit- ish Army
wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: But you’re not eating!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I uh – had bugs for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I suppose stories of the Thuggees die
hard.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: There are no stories anymore.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Well, I don’t know… we came here from a
small village and the peas- ants there told us that the Pankot Palace
was growing powerful again – becuase of some ancient evil.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Their stories are just fear and
folklore.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Maybe.. but how do you explain The Thuggee
shrine I saw right below the palace?</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: The local peasants are just as
superstitious. You’re very ob- servant, Dr. Jones. But you’re beginning
to worry Capt. Blum- burtt.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: I’m not worried, Prime Minister,
just interested.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Give me your hat…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m going to puke in it…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You know the villagers also claimed that
this palace stole something from them.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Dr. Jones, it our country a guest does
not usually insult his host.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Sorry, I thought we were just talking about
folklore.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: I’m sure it’s nothing. Just ru-
mors. What was it they claimed was stolen?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Something magical. A sacred rock.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: There, you see, Captain. A rock!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: When they lost this rock their fields and
animals dies. They also said their children were taken from them.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: I think that’s enough of this nonsense,
Dr. Jones…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: So you have something, you know, simple –
like soup or something?</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: Looks delicious!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I wanna go home…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I was dubious muself at first. Then
something connected – the village’s rock and the old legend of the
Sankara Stones…</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to
vicious rumors. I seem to re- member that in Honduras you were accused
of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The newspapers exaggerated the incident</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: And didn’t the Sultan of Madagas- car
threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his coun- try?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Exactly what we have here,
Dr. Jones.</p>
<p><strong>maharajah</strong>: I have heard the terrible stories of the
evil Thuggee cult…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m sorry if I’ve offended you.</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: Ah, dessert!</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Rather bizarre menu, woundn’t you
say?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Even if they were trying to scare us away,
a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these
people are…</p>
<p><strong>maharajah</strong>: I have seen this thing. What is it,
Dr. Jones?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Hey, nobody touches Indy’s whip!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We’re guests here, Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>maharajah</strong>: You will show me how it works please.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You wish is my command, your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>maharajah</strong>: That is wonderful! Please teach me
how!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Okay, Short Round, let go of it.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: That little Maharajah think he big
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You don’t like him do you?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Next time I flatten him! Did you see
his eyes?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy, they glow like fire and get real
crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy
when he sees one.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Yeah, that’s what happened…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I better see how Willie is.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Not leftovers?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No – real food.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, it is real food…it’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Wearing your jewels to be, prin- cess?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah – and nothing else. That shock you?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m a scientist. I like doing research on
certain “nocturnal activities” –</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You mean like love rituals…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: And mating customs…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Primitive sexual practices?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You’re taling to an authority in that
area.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re dying to come into my room, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You want me so bad, why don’t you invite
me?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Too proud to admit you’re crazy about me,
Dr. Jones?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I think you’re too used to get- ting you
own way, Willie…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: We’ll see who gives in first – I’ll leave my
door open.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Don’t catch cold.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Dr. Jones – ?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You’re dreaming, Willie. You want to make
it real, just knock on my door.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Five minutes… fat chance.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Five minutes, Dr. Jones…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: …want me to be her palace slave!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Get to sleep Indy – I stay up and keep
eye on things…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Okay, Shorty … see you in the morning…I’m
going to have a little – word with Willie.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He’s not coming…I can’t be- lieve it…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Don’t worry, Indy! Where are they?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s okay, it’s over – go turn off the
fan.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: This a cheap trick to get me over here?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No – don’t you see – crawling –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What – the bug?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get – the – bug – off!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Gee, I wouldn’t want to touch an ugly
critter like that!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Uh uh – me neither!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh no – oh no!!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You know, Willie, I’ll bet he’s mad because
they were eating his friends for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Please – oh please, I’m going to die! Get it
off!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What did I do to deserve this trip?!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: It went under. Hey, I feel wind,
Indy.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m packing! I’m getting out of here right
now tonight!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: What does it mean, Indy?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: “Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not
betray his truth.”</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I don’t care if I have to walk to Delhi, I’m
– hey!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Lock your door and don’t leave until we get
back.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: I don’t think we suppose to be in here,
Indy…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You’re right, there’s something all over
the floor…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy, the floor – there is some- thing
alive!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Holy smoke – I’m scared, Indy!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: There’s a chamber here. Come on –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hey – where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes, we’re in here…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy, I found a –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Uh – Willie?! Willie, you better get down
here!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Willie, come here! Hurry up, we’re in
trouble!!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Willie, help!!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Willie, damn it! Get down here,</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh hell – I bet I get all dirty again!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m coming, what’s the rush?! Ohh! What’s
that?! There’s stuff all over the floor! I can’t see a thing!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Move, Willie! Faster!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s all wet and icky! Aaahh – things are
moving!!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Please, Willie!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: There’s bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help
me!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Willie, open the door! GET US</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen!
There’s got to be a ful- crum release! Look around!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A what?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: A fulcrum release lever!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I can’t find any lever! Help me Indy!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Look around, Willie! There’s got to be a
liever hidden somewhere! Come on, you can do it!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: There’s a hole! I found a square hole!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s it – the release lever – look
inside!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I am – it looks horrible!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Reach inside!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I can’t, Indy! I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The lever! Willie, do it! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh God, it’s soft – it’s moving!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Willie!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Willie, help us! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get is off me – get it off!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Not that one! We had enought of that one,
thank you…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What is it…?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s a Thuggee ceremony. They’re
whorshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh my God! He ripped out his – he killed
him!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No…the heart’s still beating!</p>
<p><strong>the multitude</strong>: Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali!</p>
<p><strong>the multitude</strong>: Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Let’s go! Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: The village knew their rock was magic – but
they didn’t know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones…</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Why they glow like that?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Legend says that when the stones are
brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Diamonds…?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Okay – now listen – you wait here and keep
quiet. Shorty, keep an eye on her.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Wait – what’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m going down.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Down? Down there?! Are you crazy –!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’m not leaving without those stones.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re gonna get killed chasing after your
damn fortune and glory!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Maybe…someday. Not today.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: I keep my eye peeled, Indy.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh hell, where’s he going?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’re you – ?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Run Willie!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy – you knocked out when you fall.
You okay?</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: This is Nainsukh – from the vil- lage.
They bring him here to dig in the mines.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nainsukh</strong>: Children are small – we can work in
tunnels. Now I am too old.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: What they do to you now?</p>
<p><strong>nainsukh</strong>: I pray to Shiva – let me die. But I do
not. Now – now the evil of Kali take me.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>nainsukh</strong>: They will make me drink blood of Kali.
Then I fall into black sleep of Kali Ma…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>nainsukh</strong>: I become like them. I be alive – nut like
in nightmare. You drink the blood, you not wake up from nightmare of
Kali Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mola ram</strong>: You were caught trying to steal the
Sankara Stones.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Nobody’s perfect. The way I heard it, you
stole one of them from a small village.</p>
<p><strong>mola ram</strong>: There were five stones in the beginning.
Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like
you…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Two are still missing.</p>
<p><strong>mola ram</strong>: No. They are here – somewhere. A century
ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal
priest his the last two stones down here in the catacombs.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: That’s what you’ve got these chil- dren –
these slaves digging for?</p>
<p><strong>mola ram</strong>: They dig for the gems to support our
cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all
five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Nobody can say you don’t have a vivid
imagination.</p>
<p><strong>mola ram</strong>: You do not believe me? You will,
Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.</p>
<p><strong>maharajah</strong>: You will not suffer. I recently became of
age and tasted the blood of Kali.</p>
<p><strong>mola ram</strong>: Hold him!</p>
<p><strong>maharajah</strong>: You will learn to obey because you are
powerless!</p>
<p><strong>mola ram</strong>: The British in India will be slaughtered.
Then we will over- run the Moslems and force their “Allah” to bow to
Kali.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh my God, you scared me! Listen, you’ve got
to help. We found this tunnel –</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Jones isn’t in his room. Miss Scott
– my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi
–</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No – you can’t go! Something aw- ful’s
happened. They’ve got Short Round and I think Indy’s been –</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: We found a tennel that leads to a temple
below the palace! Please, come with me, I’ll show you!</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Miss Scott, you’re not making any
sense.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m afraid they’ll kill them! We saw
horrible things down there – they had a human sacrifice and they ripped
a man’s heart out!</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s some kind of cult! And they’ve got the
sacred stones that Indy was searching for.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: I sense the fumes of opium in all this.
Prehaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’re you talking about – I’m not a dope
fiend! I saw it! I’ll show you!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: What’re we playing, hid and seek?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, Indy, you got away! Tell them what
happened, they won’t believe me –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: It’s okay. You’re all right now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They think I’m insane. Tell them I’m not,
Indy. Please – help me …</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Hey, I thought you were supposed to be a
real tropper. Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You’ve got to go to sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I want to go home…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I don’t blame you… this hasn’t been what
you’d call a fun vaca- tion…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: I’ve spent by life crawling around in caves
and tunnels – I shouldn’t have let somebody like Willie go in there with
me.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Miss Scott panicked?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: When she saw the insects she passed out
cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re-entered
the tunnel to look around.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: As she slept, she undoubtedly had
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Then she must have run out of the room and
you found her.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Did you discover anything in that
tunnel, Dr. Jones?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Nothing. Just a dead end. That tunnel’s
been deserted for years.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my re-
port will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: I’m sure that will please the
Maharajah, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>capt. blumburtt</strong>: As I said before, we’d be happy to
escort you to Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Thanks, but I don’t think Willie is ready
to travel yet.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Indy? Did you walk to them?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: So now they believe me.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes, they believe you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Then they’ll send the soldiers down into the
temple…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No… they won’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You know you’ve been nothing but trouble
since I hooked up with you – but I have to admit I’d miss you if I lost
you…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: You won’t lose me, Willie…</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No! I’ve found it – you can’t – Kali
knows!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: – been too many lies – there’s no god’s
heaven – just – the horror! I’ve seen it – life preying on life!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: – rivers – destroying mountains – a comet
in space – exploding! Aaahh! – the screams – pitiful people – their pain
– the hate – and greed – always greed!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: – but I’ve found – Kali’s touch! Death – no
more lies – the death I’ve been searching for! Quit crying! She can hear
you – Kali knows fear – don’t you under- stand – Kali is freedom!</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out
victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali
Ma’s new power.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: His eyes – they go out.</p>
<p><strong>fat guard</strong>: No! NO!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: The pain – the pain makes him wake up!
Indy! I can make Indy wake up!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy!</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: You understand what he tells us?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Kali Ma protects us now and for- ever, and
we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh
and blood!</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: Your friend has seen and she has heard
– now she will not talk.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Indy! Help me! Indy?!</p>
<p><strong>chattar lal</strong>: This will prove your devotion to
Kali.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Please, God, don’t let them do this to me –
help me, Indy!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Indy – !</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: No – Indy – wake up!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: Wake up! It’s just a nightmare, Indy!
Wake up, please Indy!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No! Give him to me!</p>
<p><strong>short round</strong>: No, Indy, no!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look out – !</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Come on, quick!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’re we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We’re going to get them out of here – !</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Ah, sir? Excuse me –</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: No, wait!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’re we going to do?!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: There’s got to be another way out.</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Those empty cars have got to go out of the
mines.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>indiana</strong>: We’ve got to get across to the empty cars.
Wait here until I signal you.</p>
