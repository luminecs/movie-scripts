<p><strong>jan</strong>: There’s meant to be lace in the next village -
the boys are taking me.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m not sewing anything else.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: You don’t have any money, do you? Just in case
there’s silk.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Hana, I know you do!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m not sewing anything else for you!</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Don’t move! Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Good, that’s good, just stay still for me and
then we’re going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What are you doing?! What the bloody hell do
you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Do you need something?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Are you okay? Oh God, Hana, you were like
sisters.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: We keep moving him - in and out of the truck.
Why? He’s dying. What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, we can’t hardly leave him. Do you mean
leave him? We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I must be a curse. Anybody who loves me,
anybody who gets close to me - or I must be cursed. Which is it?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: The war’s over - you told me yourself. How can
it be desertion?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It’s not over everywhere. I didn’t mean
literally.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: When he dies I’ll catch up.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It’s not safe here. The whole country’s
crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what. It’s madness. I
can’t allow it. You’re not, this is natural - it’s shock. For all of us.
Hana -</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: And what if he really is a spy?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He can’t even move.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: If anything happened to you I’d never
forgive myself.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: We’re heading for Leghorn. Livorno the
Italians call it. We’ll expect you.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Up there.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: There was a Prince, who was dying, and
he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the
Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Because you’re leaning? No, you’re just on an
angle. You’re too heavy!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: Thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: Don’t drink it!</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: I can’t guarantee the vintage, my
friends. I just dug it out of the hill.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Excellent. That’s terrific, D’Ag. Toss that
up, would you.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: There are some others.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: My God, look at this!</p>
<p><strong>bermann</strong>: Incredible, Hmm? Quite incredible.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like it. There
would have been enough water here to serve an army.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Which means we’re in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Would you stockpile water near to an Oasis?
There can’t be a natural spring within fifty miles of here.</p>
<p><strong>fouad</strong>: Or they didn’t know of one.</p>
<p><strong>bermann</strong>: So, it may not be Zerzura, still
incredible.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: A pottery hill!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: A wild goose chase.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: No. Now we look in the other places. We’re
eliminating.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Good, and here comes reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I hereby Christen us the International Sand
Club!</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Marvelous plane. Did you look?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Isn’t it? Wedding present from Katharine’s
parents. I’m calling it Rupert Bear. Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: We can finally consign my old bird to the
scrapheap.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Geoffrey gave me your monograph when I
was reading up on the desert. Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I wanted to meet a man who could write
such a long paper with so few adjectives.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: A thing is still a thing no matter what you
place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a
car.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: A broken car?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Still a car.</p>
<p><strong>cliffton</strong>: Not much use, though.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Love? Romantic love, platonic love,
filial love - ? Quite different things, surely?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Uxoriousness - that’s my favorite kind of
love. Excessive love of one’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: There you have me.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: What was all the banging? Were you
fighting rats or the entire German army?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I was repairing the stairs. I found a library
and the books were very useful.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Before you find too many uses for these
books would you read some to me?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I think they’re all in Italian, but I’ll look,
yes. What about your own book?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can
read him.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Oh - I’ve found plums. We have plums in the
orchard. We have an orchard!</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: The plumness of this plum.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Water! You hear it, too, don’t you!</p>
<p><strong>fouad</strong>: European, I think, with guides.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Yes, and I think I know who this is.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: Ugly brute. Shits and roars and
complains all day. Of course, you have your aeroplane. Two now! Do you
still call yourselves explorers? I assume not.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Fenelon-Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an
explorer, can’t he? Or should Columbus have swum to America?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: I think you know all of us, except for
Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who’ve recently come out from
England.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Apprentices.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: I know your mother, of course.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: I’m also searching for the lost
Oasis, but by more authentic means.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Anyway, my friend here has a new theory -
that Zerzura doesn’t exist. So we may all be chasing windmills. Have
some food.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: Well, it’s certainly not between
here and Dakhla. Nine days of nothing but sand and sandstorms. An egg. I
found an ostrich egg and some fossils.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Isn’t Zerzura supposed to be protected by
spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What kind of fossils?</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: I’ll invite you to my paper at the
Royal Geographical Society. Are you still a member?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I think you know I am.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: Quite impossible, Madox. You must
know that. If you attempt to cross the Sand Sea due east of Kufra by car
you’ll leave your bones in the sand for me to collect.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: If you come across my bones - I hope you’ll
do me the honor of leaving them in peace. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: You have my word as a gentleman.
I’ve discovered a unique type of sand-dune. I’ve applied to the King for
permission to call it The Fenelon-Barnes Formation.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I can’t sing. but I can tell a story. I
might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I’ve noticed you carry
it…</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I’m sorry - what have you noticed?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Your book. Your Herodotus!</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: It doesn’t matter. Really. I think I can
muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules
was passionately in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges, the
son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Daskylus…</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus -
Candaules said to him I don’t think you believe me when I tell you how
beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen
magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond
dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this
story?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I will hide you in the room where we sleep,
said Candaules.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Candaules</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Candaules…you’re laughing at me.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I’m not laughing at you. Go on,
please.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: When my wife comes to lie down she always lays
her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and
from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your
leisure…</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: And that evening, it’s exactly as the
King had told him, she goes to the chair and removes her clothes, one by
one, until she stand naked in full view of Gyges. And indeed she was
more lovely than he could have imagined.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: But then the Queen looked up and saw
Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she
shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And
hearing his story, she said this -</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Off with his head!</p>
<p><strong>#name?</strong>: death for gazing on that which you should
not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his
place.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: So Gyges killed the King and married the
Queen and became ruler of Lydia for twenty eight years. The End. Do I
spin the bottle?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: And let that be a lesson to you!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Yes. Dropping off.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: What did you think you were doing in his
tent?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait
until we’re in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: You shouldn’t go into another man’s tent.
It’s inexcusable.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Her hands and feet were tied.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I looked at them. They’re shrubs, small
trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: I was talking about the girl.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his
blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great
interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl
wouldn’t leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I should try and move your bed. I want you to
be able to see the view. It’s good, it’s a view from a monastery.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I can already see.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: How? How can you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Not the window - I can’t bear the light
anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I’ve found the lost
fossils.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m turning you.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the
Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it’s in this
room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your
mouth. I can taste it. I’m chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes?
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: No sand. That’s your drugs speaking.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I can see my wife in that view.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Are you remembering more?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Could I have a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Why are you so determined to keep me
alive?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Because I’m a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>as hana hops and jumps in the shadows she is suddenly on a
train in</strong>: 1944. A HOSPITAL TRAIN ploughs through the night
carrying the wounded back to Naples.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came
out - I saved you the pieces.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: You’re the prettiest girl I ever saw.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Would you kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: No, I’ll get you some tea. Wait till you’re in
Naples. You’ll find a girl there.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Just kiss me. It would mean such a lot to
me.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Would it?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>#1 injured man</strong>: Nurse - I can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>#2 injured man</strong>: Nurse? Would you kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>#3 injured man</strong>: You’re so pretty!</p>
<p><strong>#4 injured man</strong>: Hinky-dinky parlez-vous!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Very funny. Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Where are we going? I don’t want to be kissing
in a crowd. I have six hours.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Whoa - give me a chance!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: I’ve got a surprise. A boat! We can go to
Capri. It’s got a cabin, it’s private.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’d like to spend a night with you in a
bed.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: We can do that when we’re very very old.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Buon’ Giorno!</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Are you Hana?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I met your friend Mary. She said I
should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we’re neighbors - my
house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.
Bonjour.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Bonjour.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I’d like to take credit, but it’s from
Mary. My name’s David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David.
Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: They’re fresh. I haven’t eaten an egg
in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no
eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who
separates them?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: You were in Africa?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Yeah, for a while.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: So was my Patient.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I’d like to stay. That’s the long and
short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it’s convenient, if there’s
room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language.
There are Partisans to be -</p>
<p><strong>#name?</strong>: relieve them of their weapons, you know -
while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I’d be good at that.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: So you can shoot a pistol?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: If you said yes I would have had a reason. You
should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I’m okay. Look, it’s a big house. We
needn’t disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I’ll sleep in the
stables. I don’t care where I sleep. I don’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Because we’re fine here. I don’t know what
Mary told you about me, but I don’t need company, I don’t need to be
looked at.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Fine. I’m not looking.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: There’s a man downstairs. He brought us eggs.
He might stay.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Why? Can he lay eggs?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He’s Canadian.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Why are people always so happy when
they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal
when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with
you?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He needn’t disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Me? He can’t. I’m already
disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He won’t disturb us then. I think he’s after
morphine. There’s a war. Where you come from becomes important. And
besides - we’re vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night.
Voices.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: How much did you pay?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Hello! Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: They don’t see foreign women in this market.
How much did you pay?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Which stall?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: You’ve been cheated, don’t worry, we’ll take
it back.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I don’t want to go back.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: This is not worth eight pounds,
Mrs. Clifton.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I don’t care to bargain.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: That insults them.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I don’t believe that. I think you are
insulted by me, somehow. You’re a foreigner too, aren’t you, here, in
this market?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I should be very happy to obtain the correct
price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social
graces. How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Gentlemen, good evening!</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: How is your charming wife?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Uh, marvelous. She’s in love with the hotel
plumbing. She’s either in the swimming pool - she swims for hours, she’s
a fish, quite incredible - or she’s in the bath. Actually, she’s just
outside. Chaps Only in the Long Bar.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Of course. Well, we should all go out onto
the terrace.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Oh no, really. She has her book.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: I won’t hear of it. None of us will.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Mrs. Clifton, you’ll have to forgive us.
We’re not accustomed to the company of women.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by
book. and then nodding at Alm�sy Please. Signor D’Agostino, Herr
Bermann.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: The team is in mourning, darling.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: I’m afraid we’re not having much luck
obtaining funds for the expedition.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: How awful. What will you do?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: A more modest expedition, or even wait a
year. Remind our families we still exist.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Good heavens, are you married, Madox?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Very much so. We are all, save my friend
here.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I feel much better, don’t you darling? We
were feeling rather self-conscious. Let’s toast, then. To absent
wives.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: And present ones.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: And future ones.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Why did you follow me yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: After the market, you followed me to the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I was concerned. As I said, women in that
part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You felt obliged to.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: As the wife of one of our party.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: So why follow me? Escort me, by all
means. Following me is predatory, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I was just saying, I’m going to cable
Downing Street, see if I can’t stir up a few shillings - Katharine’s
mother and the PM’s wife are best -</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Darling, for goodness’ sake!</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Well, she is!</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Finally! So you’re our Canadian
pickpocket?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Thief, I think, is more accurate.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Oh, all over.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: All over? I kept trying to cover a very
modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now’s our
opportunity to swap war wounds.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Then I’m definitely going.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Does she have war wounds?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I think anybody she ever loves tends to
die on her.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Are you planning to be the
exception?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Me? You’ve got the wrong end of the
stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your
name.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: And you’ve forgotten yours.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I told her you would never invent such
a preposterous name.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I told her you can forget everything but
you never forget your name.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: What about your rank or serial number?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: No. I think I was a pilot. I was found
near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some
time.</p>
<p><strong>this convalescence hospital has been fashioned from a long
row of</strong>: BATHING CABINS ON THE COAST, complete with Campari
Umbrellas and metal tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the
dying and the comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted
conversation. Hana walks up to the Patient’s cabin. He is propped up
with a view of the sea, which is interrupted by the pacing Officer. Hana
has a blanket and a chart for the Patient’s bed. She busies herself.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Do you remember where you were born?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Am I being interrogated? You should be
trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham
Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I
can, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Why? Are you German?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: How do you know you’re not German if you
don’t remember anything?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: You tell me. I remember a lot of
things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil’s
Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on
the shore, nothing between you and France.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: This was your garden?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Or my wife’s.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Then you were married?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I think so. Although I believe that to
be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Thank you. Look - my lungs are useless
- I’ve got this much lung…the rest of my organs are packing up - what
could it possibly matter if I were Tutankhamun? I’m a bit of toast, my
friend - butter me and slip a poached egg on top.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: My leave is canceled. I can’t meet you
later.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Excuse me -</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just
for a few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Your friend?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He’s going back to the front this evening. I
can’t see him otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Just go off. I’ll be quite all
right.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: No, I can’t go, but if it, if you weren’t
offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin
is crammed. This is as private as we’ll get.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Well then - yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: This is Captain McGann.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Please, don’t waste your time on
pleasantries -</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I’m going to sing. If I sing I shan’t
hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: You’ve got a mustache.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: A bit of one.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I was looking forward to this evening.</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: I had a hotel room.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I thought that was for when we were very very
old?</p>
<p><strong>stuart</strong>: I’m feeling old.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Supper.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Rabbit hunting.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I could help you. I could get you off
that.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Can you cook the rabbit or will you try
and bring that back to life?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: It’s a week. We didn’t know where you were -
or if you coming back, or -</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: You should be happy. What were you going
to do for him when it ran out?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What do you do? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Some gave me a dress. You know what’s
great? What I’m learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles
you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we’re in the right. I like
that.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Something smells so rich. My stomach is
heaving -</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I’m
cooking it.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: That’s a different dress.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you
know him? Do you recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Do I recognize him? I recognize what he
is. I like him. He’s Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch
rabbits.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Hello. Not to interrupt but we’re
celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: This is an incredible story - about a man
hunting an Ostrich, he’s been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he’s
been there, but his map, the route he’s describing, he couldn’t survive
the journey now, but he’s a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we’re
onto an Ostrich. I’m telling her your map is poetry.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: What do you mean, poetry?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: A mountain curved like a woman’s back, a
plateau the shape of an ear.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the
Ostrich come in?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an
ostrich, it’s the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an
ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the
ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the
horizon, and doesn’t move, doesn’t eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.
At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the
next day, the man is there, but he’s nearer. Haunting the ostrich.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not
just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from
this one animal. So, each day the man gets closer. And the ostrich is
not sure - has something changed? - now the standing man is only a few
yards from where it feeds. And then one day, the man is in the wadi, in
the water. And the Ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the
man JUMPS UP - and captures it.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: What is he saying? Come on, what did he
say?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: He said - be careful.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Be careful? You mean you - or me?
Who?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Her or me?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: The one who appears not to be moving.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Gentlemen, to Zerzura.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Zerzura.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: And a special thank you to Geoffrey and
Katharine, without whose fund-raising heroics we should still be kicking
our heels.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: To arm-twisting.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back
to Cairo.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Have to return the favor - take a few
photographs for the army.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Darling, Peter says I could stay…</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What kind of photographs?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Portraits. The Brigadier, the Brigadier’s
wife, the Brigadier’s dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier
breathing.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Why do you think? About my staying?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I
suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: But finally able to explore the Cairo
night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and
- I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Safe journey.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: You too. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Clifton - your wife - do you think it’s
appropriate to leave her?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Appropriate?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I think the desert is, it’s - for a woman -
it’s very tough, I wonder if it’s not too much for her.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She
told me yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: All the same, I, were I you I would be
concerned -</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I’ve known Katharine since she was three,
my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we
were man and wife. I think I’d know what is and what isn’t too much for
her. I think she’s know herself.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Why are you people so threatened by a
woman?!</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’ve been thinking about - how does
somebody like you decide to come to the desert? What is it? You’re doing
whatever you’re doing - in your castle, or wherever it is you live, and
one day, you say, I have to go to the desert - or what?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I once traveled with a terrific guide, who
was taking me to Faya. He didn’t speak for nine hours. At the end of it
he pointed at the horizon and said - Faya! That was a good day!</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Actually, you sing.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You sing. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I do not.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Ask Al Auf.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’ll be down to get you in the taxi,
honey, you’d better be ready about half-past eight…!</p>
<p><strong>al auf</strong>: Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar…</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Madox! Madox!</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: My God, they’re swimming!</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: Have you seen this? Astonishing.
Perfectly preserved.</p>
<p><strong>bermann</strong>: I love the desert, you see. That’s my,
that’s my - I can’t think of the word. How do you explain? To someone
who’s never been here? Feelings which seem quite normal.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I don’t know, my friend. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>to misjudge the line and suddenly the dune collapses under
the tire and</strong>: THE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE
EDGE. D’Ag - following, Fouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can’t
stop his own car from being caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT
PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND INTO BERMANN’S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS
CRUNCH, the radiator exploding. Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a
little way behind, manages to stay clear of the trouble. He jumps out of
the vehicle and slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the
passengers stumble out of the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the
upright vehicle, the wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the
air, a puddle of oil spreading ominously.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: I’ll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six
hours at the outside.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Try to get a second radiator, we’ll bury it
between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned
badly.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Bermann!</p>
<p><strong>kamal</strong>: May God make safety your companion.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I shall stay behind, of course</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I insist. There clearly isn’t room for us
all, I’m the least able to dig, and I’m not one of the walking wounded.
Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it’s the most effective method of
persuading my husband to abandon whatever he’s doing and rescue us.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I thought you might paste them into your
book.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: We took several photographs, there’s no
need.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’d like you to have them.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: There’s really no need. This is just a
scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: And that would be unconscionable, I
suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes. Of course it would.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: You should come into the shelter.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’m quite all right, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Look over there.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: What am I looking at?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: See what’s happening to them - the
stars.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: They’re so untidy. I’m just trying to
rearrange them.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: In an hour there will be no stars. The air
is filling with sand.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: This is not very good, is it?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Shall we be all right?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: …let me tell you about winds. There is a
whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the Aajej, against which the fellahin
defend themselves with knives. The Ghibli from Tunis rolls and rolls and
produces a rather strange nervous condition…</p>
<p><strong>#name?</strong>: Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.
Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England,
producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Fiction. We had a house on that coast and
it never rained blood. Go on. More.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a
wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched
out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Our tracks, where are they?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Madox will have calculated how many miles,
they’ll soon turn around.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Oh my God, the others!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Could I ask you, please, to paste you
paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be
honored.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward
to ask how much water we have?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little
in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all
cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There’s also a plant -
I’ve never seen it but I’m told you can cut a piece the size of a heart
from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious
liquid.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Find that plant. Cut out its heart.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Kamal is passing blood. He must have had
some internal damage in the crash. He needs medicine. I think we must
risk the other flare.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Geoffrey’s not in Cairo. He’s not
actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn’t a wedding present. It belongs
to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North
Africa. So I think he’s in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his
sudden appearance.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: And the marriage - is that a fiction?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: No, the marriage isn’t a fiction.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Thank God. Oh, thank God.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Do they know them?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: No, but I think I do.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Am I K. in your book? I think I must
be.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: I recollect your saying to ignore
your bones but I assume you have no objection to my rescuing your
companion? Good evening, Mrs. Clifton.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: I’d like to introduce you to my
camel - the most notable beast on earth. I understand you found some
remarkable caves.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: Paintings of swimmers?
Remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Will you not come in?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Will you please come in?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Mrs. Clifton -</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I believe you still have my book.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You still have sand in your hair.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’m impressed you can sew.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You sew very badly.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: You don’t sew at all!</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: A woman should never learn to sew, and if
she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: That makes it harder still.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: When were you most happy?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: When were you least happy?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Okay. And what do you love? Say
everything.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: What do I love? I love rice pudding, and
water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater
- all my secret paths.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with
other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My
husband.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What do you hate most?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: A lie. What do you hate most?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you
should forget me.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Could I ask you to move? I’m sorry -
but when you turn, the sheets, I can’t really bear the sheets moving
over me. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Yes, of course, I’m so sorry. Stupid of
me.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Okay, Type Os, the vampires wait. Everybody’s
giving a pint.</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Ugh! If they were sucking it out I wouldn’t
mind. It’s the needle I can’t stand.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: You’re a nurse - how ca you be frightened of
needles!</p>
<p><strong>wounded soldier</strong>: Can’t wait to have me dead? You
bitch!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Try t be calm. Ssssshhh. Come on. Be calm now.
Ssshhhh. Be peaceful. It’s okay. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>canadian soldier</strong>: Is there anybody here from
Picton?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Picton? I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>canadian soldier</strong>: I’d like to see somebody from home
before I go.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Why Picton?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: He’s from there - edge of Lake Ontario
right, Soldier?</p>
<p><strong>jan</strong>: Where’s your Stuart from? Somewhere near there,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: As him what company he’s with?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Third Canadian Fusiliers.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Does he know a Captain McGann?</p>
<p><strong>canadian soldier</strong>: He bought it. Yesterday. Shot to
bits.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Doesn’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He’s gone, hasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: No. He’s - no.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Oh God. Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Hana? Hana? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Don’t touch me if you’re going to try and fuck
me.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I’ll have some of your water. It’s
hot.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: You have to protect yourself from
sadness. This is the thing I’ve learned. You’re in love with him, aren’t
you? Your patient. Do you think he’s a saint or something? Because of
the way he looks? I don’t think he is.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m not in love with him. I’m in love with
ghosts. And so is he. He’s in love with ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Who are his ghosts?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Ask him.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: What if I told you he did this to
me?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What? How could he have? When?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I’m one of his ghosts and he wouldn’t
even know. It’s like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my
fucking hands in Tobruk.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask
him who he’s killed.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Please don’t creep around this house.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Tell me about this, this is in your
handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared
with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but
smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire… I love that, I
believe that. Who is K?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: K is for Katharine.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Say you’re sick.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: What? No!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Say you’re feeling faint - the sun.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I can’t work. I can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lady hampton</strong>: Katharine!</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Coming. I can’t sleep. I woke up shouting
in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it’s the thing in the
desert, the trauma.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I can still taste you.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: This is empty, just coming!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I’m trying to write with your taste in my
mouth. Swoon. I’ll catch you.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’m fine. How silly.</p>
<p><strong>officer’s wife</strong>: It’s the heat.</p>
<p><strong>lady hampton</strong>: You should sit down, darling. She’s
quite all right. Are you pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>lady hampton</strong>: How romantic. With Fiona I fell over
every five minutes. Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I think I might go inside and sit down
for a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lady hampton</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: No, please. I shall be absolutely
fine.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Have you seen Katharine?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: It’s Geoffrey under this.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I haven’t, no. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Darling, I just heard. You poor sausage,
are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’m fine. I got hot.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Lady H said she thought you might be -</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’m not pregnant. I’m hot. I’m too
hot.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Sweltering. Come on, I’ll take you
home.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Can’t we really go home? I can’t breathe.
Aren’t you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn’t you die to
feel rain on your face? It’s Christmas and it’s all - I don’t know - if
you asked me I’d go home tomorrow. If you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Sweetheart, you know we can’t go home,
there might be a war.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a
disguise.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I do so love you. What do you smell of?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Marzipan! I think you’ve got marzipan in
your hair. No wonder you’re homesick.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Are you outside?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I can’t hide anymore. I breathe like a
dog. I lose my balance. Stealing’s got harder.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Why do I feel if I had your book I would
know everything?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I don’t even know if it is my book. The
Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It’s mine now. I heard
your breathing and thought it might be rain. I’m dying for rain - of
course I’m dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Is it you? If I said Moose… I look
different, fuck, why shouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Moose.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: First wedding anniversary - what do you
call it?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I don’t know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I
don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I have come to love that little tap of
the fingernail against the syringe. Tap.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Excuse me. Yes? I don’t have the key to that
door.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: The Germans were here. The Germans were all
over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite
hiding places.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I see. Then may be you’re safe as long as you
only play Bach. He’s German.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Is something funny?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: No, but, no, not at all. I’m sorry. You came
to the doors, that’s all and -</p>
<p><strong>#name?</strong>: worried about mines. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I’ve met you before.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He wants us to move out, says there could be
fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I’m mad because I laughed at
him. He’s Indian, he wears a turban.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Sikh. If he wears a turban, he’s a
Sikh.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’ll probably marry him.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Really? That’s sudden.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: My mother always told me I would summon my
husband by playing the piano.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I liked it better when there were just the two
of us.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Why? Is he staying?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: We should charge! Doesn’t anyone have a
job to do?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: They have to clear all the local roads of
mines. That’s a big job. They won’t stay in the house. They’re putting
up their tent in the garden.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: In that case, I suppose we can’t
charge.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Darling, it’s me, I’m sorry, something’s
come up. Don’t sulk - I’ll be back tomorrow evening. I promise. Okay my
precious, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: I didn’t know you were going anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I’m not. I’m going to surprise her. It’s
our anniversary. She’s forgotten, of course. What’s the symbol for your
first anniversary? I should get something. Is it paper? Moose! Moose,
you there? First Anniversary - is it cotton?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Is what cotton?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: First Wedding Anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>rupert</strong>: He’s hopeless!</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Your day will come, my sausage.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Your first anniversary is Paper.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Stop here.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: This is - what is this?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: It’s a folk song.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Arabic?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: No, no, it’s Hungarian. My daijka sang it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: It’s beautiful. What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: It’s a long song - Szerelem means love…and
the story - there’s a Hungarian Count, he’s a wanderer, a fool. For
years he’s on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he
falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who
beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave. He sews her clothes, he
worships the hem of -</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Ouch! See - you’re always beating me..!</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You bastard, I was believing you!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I claim this shoulder blade - oh no, wait -
I want this!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: This - what’s it called? - this place, I
love it - this is mine! I’m asking the King permission to call it the
Almasy Bosphorous.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I thought we were against ownership? I
can stay tonight.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Madox knows, I think. He’s tried to warn me.
He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it’s his idea of a
man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: This is a different world - is what I
tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Yes. A different wife.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Hotel now, sir?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I don’t care to bargain. It’s full of
saffron, just in case you think I’m giving it to you to encourage your
sewing.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: That day, had you followed me to the
market?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Of course. You didn’t need to slap my face
to make me feel as if you’d slapped my face.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Shall we be all right?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Yes. Yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Thought you’d never wake up!</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Where did you find that?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I liberated it.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I think that’s called looting.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: No-one should own music. The real
question is who wrote the song?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Irving Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: For?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Top Hat.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Is there a song you don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: No. He sings all the time.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Good morning. Did you know that? You’re always
singing?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I’ve been told that before.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kip’s another one.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Hello miss.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I was going to say - if you want to eat with
us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Very kind of you, we can always eat in the
town with the others -</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to
appear, so please.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’ll ask the Lieutenant. But thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: You saved my life. I haven’t forgotten. I
thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I
felt like a child who can’t keep her balance.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: A toddler</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Sorry, is it all right I’m seeing this?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: My hair was long. At some point. I’ve
forgotten what a nuisance it is to wash. You know - if you were ever
around - we get water from the pump at noon.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive
oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: For my hair?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Yes, for your hair.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Because you’re reading it too fast!</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: You have to read Kipling slowly! Your
eye is too impatient - think about the speed of his pen. What is it - He
sat comma in defiance of municipal orders comma astride the gun
Zamzammah on her brick… What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher
-</p>
<p><strong>#name?</strong>: natives called the Lahore Museum.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It’s still there, the cannon, outside the
museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household
in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon
at my people - comma - The natives.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: So what do you really object to - the
writer or what he’s writing about?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What I really object to, Uncle, is your
finishing all my condensed milk. And the message everywhere in your book
- however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be
ruled by the British.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Hana, we have discovered a shared
please - the boy and I.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Arguing about books.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Condensed milk - one of the truly great
inventions.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I’ll get another tin.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I didn’t like that book either. It’s all about
men. Too many men. Just like this house.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: You like him, don’t you? Your voice
changes.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I don’t think it does. Anyway, he’s
indifferent to me.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I don’t think it’s indifference.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Hana was just telling me that you were
indifferent -</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Hey! -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Well, I’m indifferent to cooking, not Hana’s
cooking in particular. Have either of you ever tried condensed milk
sandwiches?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Careful - careful!</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: This is wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He’s saying it’s wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: And I’m telling you there’s nothing there to
explore.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: No, because you can’t see from the air! If
you could explore from the air life would be very simple! Look! What is
that? Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Which we’ve overflown twice.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Which we couldn’t explore because of rocks,
because of cross-winds, it’s sloppy. And here - and here - we could be
staring at Zerzura.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: So - on Thursday you don’t trust Bell’s map -
Bell was a fool, Bell couldn’t draw a map, but on Friday he’s suddenly
infallible?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: And where are the Expedition Maps?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: In my room.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Those maps belong to His Majesty’s
Government. They’re confidential. They shouldn’t be left lying around
for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Don’t be so bloody na�ve. You know there’s a
war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British
Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May
1939.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Why do they care about our maps?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads,
spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Own the desert.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: That place at the base of a woman’s throat?
You know - the hollow - here - does that have an official name?</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: For God’s sake, man - pull yourself
together.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Beggin your pardon, miss, but have you got
a lighter?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I love Ginger, she’s a foxy girl, ain’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I can’t do this, I can’t do this any
more.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’d better get back. Say goodbye
here.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I’m not agreeing. Don’t think I’m agreeing,
because I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I just know - any minute he’ll find out,
we’ll barge into somebody we’ll - and it will ill him.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Don’t go over it again, please.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Katharine -</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I just wanted you to know. I’m not missing
you yet.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You will. You will.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I’m still here.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: You’d better be.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Don’t depend on it. Will you? That
little bit of air, each day there’s less of it, which is al right, which
is quite all right.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I’ve been talking to Caravaggio - my
research assistant - there’s meant to be a ghost in the Cloisters. I can
join him!</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: It’s the boy.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Go to the left! Keep to the left! There are
mines and trip wires everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Get Hardy. He’s on the other side of town. In
the hills. Get him to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: It’s okay - I’ll help. Please.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: The mines, the wires, there’s a trick. Some
explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: There’s a mine here, but the others are far
enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out
which one to cut before I fall over.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: So I follow the wires?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You get Hardy.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I follow the wires.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Don’t touch them.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Why would anyone do this?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I’ve done this. I’ve had to do this.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Give me a second.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What are you doing?! Hana!</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What is this business with you and explosives?
Do you think you’re immune?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I promise you that was the right thing to do.
He’s my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don’t die.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Okay. Get away from here. Quick.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m not scared. So many people have died
around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don’t feel like being
shy.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You must get away. Before I cut. I’m not
cutting if you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Actually, you can’t cut, can you? You’ll fall
over. Give me the pliers.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Don’t talk. Check again. Lie flat and then
cut.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Hana! Hana! Kip! Hana!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m sorry. I forgot you’d be worrying. We’re
all safe. It was a mine, but not the mine. Nobody’s hurt. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: And you’re definitely traveling with him of
your own free will?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Just wanting to be sure. And he’s taking
you to church?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Yes. We’re going to a funeral. A cow has died.
And in his religion they’re sacred.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kip?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: There was a general who wore a patch
over a perfectly good eye. The men fought harder for him. Sometimes I
think I could get up and dance. What’s under your bandages?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Hold the ends.</p>
<p><strong>aicha</strong>: He’s waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: What a bloody flap, eh? I heard from
Alexandria this morning - apparently no-one there is accepting British
pounds. And if you pick up a telephone everybody’s practicing their
German. What do you do - do you take these things? Look, Moose, we need
you to stay in Tobruk. A bit of a short straw but the thinking is we’ll
be back - I mean, we will be back - but…and in the interim we need eyes
and ears on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk. What
are they going to be doing?</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: Giving Rommel a bloody nose. That’s
my suggestion. But did you hear the BBC last nigh? Tobruk is of no
strategic importance - makes you wonder.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: Jerry’s got our maps you know.
Swines. Before the war we helped them run about the desert making maps -
and now they get spies into Cairo using our maps, they’ll get Rommel
into Cairo using our maps. The whole of the desert like a bus route and
we gave it to them. Any foreigner who turned up - welcome to the Royal
Geographic, take our maps. Madox went mad, you know - you knew Peter
Madox? - after he found out he’d been betrayed by his friend. Absolutely
destroyed the poor sod. Shot himself in a church in Dorset.</p>
<p><strong>fenelon-barnes</strong>: I’d like to get that bastard Alm�sy
- settle the score, eh? That’s my fantasy - said he, clearing out. Must
have been a spy all along.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: David Caravaggio.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Petty thief, six months imprisonment
Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I keep explaining. You’ve got the wrong
man. My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini. Bellini, Caravaggio, both
painters, I think that is confusing you.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Is this you?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: It is you. This was taken in Cairo at
British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41. And this
-February 42.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: It’s impossible. I was buying or selling
something. I’ve been to Cairo many times.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: You are a Canadian spy working for the
Allies. Code-name Moose.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Could I have a doctor? I am passing
blood. I must be bleeding internally. Can you get a doctor? Look - I’m
leaking blood. He kicks me. He kicks me all the time.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: He’s asking for a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: You want a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Yes, I’ve been asking for weeks, a
month, I don’t know, also my leg was -</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: We don’t have a doctor, but we do have a
nurse.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A
nurse? Great.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Leave it and get the nurse!</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Why is there so much nose? I can’t hear
myself think! Look - give me something. So we can all get out of this
room. A name. A code. It’s too hot.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I slept with the girl. I’ve got a wife
in Tripoli. A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. This is
your nurse, by the way. She’s Moslem, so she’ll understand all of this.
What’s the punishment for adultery? Let’s leave it at that. You’re
married and you were fucking another woman, so that’s - is it the hands
that are cut off? Or is that for stealing? Does anyone know?</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Well, you must know. You were brought up
Libya, yes?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Don’t cut me.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Or was it Toronto?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Don’t cut me. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Ten fingers. How about this? You give me a
name for every finger - doesn’t matter who. I get something, you keep
something. I’m trying to be reasonable. Fenelon-Barnes, we could call
that two names. Are thumbs fingers? Is a thumb a finger?</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: I get no help from these people.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The telephone -</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>stenographer</strong>: That Geneva Convention. I’m -</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: You can’t do that! Hey - come on!</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Go! Hey! Go!</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Listen, I’ll give you a name. What name
did you say? I knew them! I promise. Please - please!</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: Cut the other thumb.</p>
<p><strong>m�ller</strong>: This one! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: The man who took my thumbs, I found him
eventually - he’s dead. The man who took my photograph, I found him too
- that took me a year. He’s dead. Another man took that man across the
desert to Cairo. Now I intend to find him.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I believe I’m rather late.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Good, we’re all here? A toast, to the
International Sand club - may it soon resurface.</p>
<p><strong>the others</strong>: The International Sand Club!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Misfits, buggers, fascists, and paedophiles.
God bless us every one.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Oops! Mustn’t say International. Dirty word.
Filthy word. His Majesty! Die F�hrer! Il Duce.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: Sorry, what’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: And the people here don’t want us. Are you
kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials… -
isn’t that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging
to be spared a knighthood. Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What’s my point? Oh! I’ve invented a new
dance - the Bosphorus Hug. Anybody up to it? Madox? D’Ag? Come on
D’Aggers.</p>
<p><strong>d’agostino</strong>: Let’s eat first. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: …We’ll bathe at Brighton, the fish we’ll
frighten when we’re in. your bathing suit so thin will make the
shellfish grin, fin to fin. – Those were the words - actually - before
they were cleaned up. Could be a song for you, Mrs. Clifton -</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Look, either shut up, or go home.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of
apologies all round.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Why did you hold his collar?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What? What? That boy, that little boy, you
were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Would you let me pass?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Is he next? Do you drag him into your little
room? Where is it? Is this it?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I’ve watched you - on verandahs, at Garden
Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there? How can you ever smile?
As if your life hadn’t capsized?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You know why?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Dance with me.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want
the things which are mine. Which belong to me.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Do you think you’re the only one who
feels anything? Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Why don’t you go? You should sleep.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Would you like me to?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hana.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kip.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: He’s sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Only we have to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’ll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: A bomb. At the Viaduct.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Does he have to go?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What if you couldn’t find him…? Sergeant, not
today, please. Not this morning.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What’s happening? Am I needed?</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: I’m afraid so, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Don’t go. I’m frightened. I can love a coward,
I can’t love another dead man.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: This is what I do. I do this every day.</p>
<p><strong>kip is lowered by a pulley into the shaft the sappers have
made around</strong>: THE BOMB. Hardy supervises. The bombs huge - 2,
000 lbs, and protrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a
pool of sludge at the base of the viaduct.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Serial number - KK-1P2600.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hardy! Hardy! What’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Corporal!? Dade!!</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Tanks, sir. Don’t know what it’s about. God
only knows.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: What is this - a bloody carnival? Stop
them!</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: You’ve got to cut, sir, that frost won’t
last.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: This is making me incredibly angry.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>hardy</strong>: Get a blanket! Dade! Get the Lieutenant a
blanket.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: It’s over, Sarge. It’s over. Jerry’s
surrendered. Sir, congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kip!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kip - come and dance with me</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Yes. Later.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I’ve had a drink. Fatal.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Well, anything you do is likely to be
fatal, so you know -</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Very true!</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: That was a dance we invented at the
International Sand Club.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: What? You and Madox? Or you and
Katharine Clifton?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>spalding</strong>: Booby trap. They was running up the Union
Jack, sir, up off that statue - It just went off.</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Should have been me. It was my idea but
Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir, him and Blackler.</p>
<p><strong>spalding</strong>: Sir - you don’t want to look.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Who’s that girl?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: His fiancee, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Hardy’s?</p>
<p><strong>dade</strong>: Kept it a bit dark.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the
Patient, Hardy: they’re everything that’s good about England. I couldn’t
even say what that was. We didn’t exchange two personal words, and we’ve
been together through some terrible things, some - he was engaged to a
girl in the village! - I mean - and us - he never once… He didn’t ask me
if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don’t even
know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: You loved him.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: If one night I didn’t come to the tent, what
would you do?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I try not to expect you.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: But if it got late and I hadn’t shown up?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Then I’d think there must be a reason.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: You wouldn’t come to find me? That makes me
never want to come here.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Then I tell myself he spends all day
searching, in the night he wants to be found.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is
still out, which I’m looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with
Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still…</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Bermann thinks he’ll be interned, poor
fellow. I’m going to do what I can, but… And D’Ag turns out to be a
great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I told you so.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: We didn’t care about countries. Did we?
Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was
something finer than that.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I’ll
look after it for you.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: When’s Clifton picking you up?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Tomorrow afternoon. Don’t worry. I’ll be
ready.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: I’ll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra
Oasis. So if you need it…hard to know how long one’s talking about. We
might all be back in a month or two.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: I have to teach myself not to read too much
into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly
anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Goodbye, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: May God make safety your companion.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: There is no God. But I hope someone looks
after you.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: In case you’re still wondering - this is
called the supasternal notch.</p>
<p><strong>madox</strong>: Come and visit us in Dorset. When all this
nonsense is over. You’ll never come to Dorset.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Sometimes I need you to find me.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Hana tells me you’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: There are going to be trials, they want
me to interpret, don’t they know I’m allergic to courtrooms?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: We shall miss you.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I
was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana’s friend, tells
me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is
- retreat - how you’d come in from the Desert and you were burned and
you didn’t know your name but you knew the words to every song there was
and you had one possession -</p>
<p><strong>#name?</strong>: full of letters and cuttings, and then I
knew it must be you.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: I’d seen you writing in that book. At
the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a
name.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Before you went over to the Germans,
before you got Rommel’s spy across the desert and inside British
headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that
torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: And you thought you’d come and settle
the score?</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: You were the only man who knew the
desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles
of nothing.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I had to get back to the desert. I made
a promise. The rest meant nothing to me.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: The rest meant nothing to me.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: There was a result to what you did. It
wasn’t just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn’t
unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could
have died.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Thousands of people did die, just
different people.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: But you were among the British, they
were your friends - why betray them?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Is that what you thought? That I
betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed
me.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are
you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I can’t move. I can’t get out.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Why did he bring you?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: A surprise, he said.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Poor Geoffrey. He knew. He must have
known all the time. He was shouting - I love you, Katharine, I love you
so much. Is he badly hurt? His neck is odd.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Please don’t move me. It hurts too
much.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: We’ve got to get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: It hurts too much.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I know, darling, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Why did you hate me?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Don’t you know you drove everybody
mad?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: You speak so many bloody languages and
you never want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: You’re wearing the thimble.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Of course. You idiot. I always wear it.
I’ve always worn it. I’ve always loved you.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: It’s so cold.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I know. I’m sorry. I’ll make a fire. I’ll be
back.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Don’t leave me!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I’m just going to find things for the
fire.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Shall we be all right?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Listen to me, Katharine. You’ve broken your
ankle and I’m going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might
be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it’s hurting you to
breathe. I’m going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in
the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I
reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I’ll be back and
we’ll be fine, and I’ll never leave you.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Do you promise? I wouldn’t want to die
here. I wouldn’t want to die in the desert. I’ve always had a rather
elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I
know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up.
With a view of the sea. So promise me you’ll come back for you.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I promise I’ll come back. I promise I’ll
never leave you. And there’s plenty of water and food. You can have a
party.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: And a good read. Don’t waste it.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know
he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I’m sorry, Katharine.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Every night I cut out my heart but in the
morning it was full again.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Tell me about your garden.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: Our Garden, our garden - not so much the
garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to
the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil’s
Chimney it was called - The Devil’s Chimney, I don’t know why. Darling.
My darling.</p>
<p><strong>the patient’s</strong>: Seventy miles, north - north west. I
had Madox’s compass. A man can walk in the desert as fast as a camel.
That’s about two and a half miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: I stopped at noon and at twilight.
Three days there, I told her, then three hours back by jeep. Don’t go
anywhere. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Could I trouble you for some water?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you
come from?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I desperately need a jeep. There’s been an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: No, I’m not thinking clearly - I need a
doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I’ll pay, of
course - and some morphine and… Seventy miles - I can be back here by
dusk.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Do you have your papers, sir?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: If I could just see some
identification.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Am I not talking sense? - forgive me, I’m,
I’ve been walking, I’ve - there’s a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir,
in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical
Society.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Right. And what’s your name, sir?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Count Laszlo de Alm�sy.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Alm�sy - would you mind just spelling that
for me? What nationality would that be?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Look, listen to me. A woman is dying - my
wife! - is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three
days! I don’t want to spell my name, I want you to give me this
jeep!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I understand you are agitated - perhaps you
would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: No! NO! Don’t radio anybody, just give me
the fucking jeep!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Hey! Hey! Stop this jeep! Let me out of here
- there’s a woman dying, there’s a woman dying while I’m - Hey!</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Shut-up!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you,
please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and
listen to me. My wife is dying.</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to
another word from you I’ll give you a fucking good hiding.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Fritz? What are you talking about? Who’s
Fritz?</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: That’s your name innit? Count Fucking
Arsehole Von Bismarck? What’s that supposed to be then, Irish?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Let me out, let me out, let me out -
Katharine! Katharine!</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Excuse me. I also need to use the
lavatory.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You’ll have to wait. Sarge! Jerry wants to
use the lav - says it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Where are we going, please?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: To the coast. Benghazi. Soon be there. Get
a boat home. You’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Cramps. It’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Go on then - you take him.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: So yes. She died because of me. Because
I loved her. Because I had the wrong name.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: That gun at Lahor, Kipling’s cannon - Zamzammah
- remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to
make an ordinary thing out of guns.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: When I went to England I was amazed at what
went on, the waste - I’d been taught to re-use everything, the dung from
a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live
for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I should go to the house, get breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: The lamp was burning all night in his room.
Caravaggio was there with him.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: This is hot!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Nya-nya-nya!</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: And did you never see Katharine? You
never got back to the Cave?</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Yes, I got back there finally to keep
my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn’t… I
couldn’t even do that properly.</p>
<p><strong>the metal glows a vivid red on the anvil.</strong>: Suddenly
Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing column of
steam.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: You get to the morning and the poison
leaks away, doesn’t it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you
want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my
friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some
Guardian Angel.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: You can’t kill me. I died years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: No, now I can’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Kip - what are - ?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Stay out of this.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Kip?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always
said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers,
the map-makers; never shake hands with them.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What have I been doing all this time? Do you
know how many mines I’ve seen? - more mines than there are soldiers,
more - how many mines we’ve put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in
corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Kip, listen -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I said keep out of this!</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Can you hear? Can you hear what they’re
celebrating? I listened to you, Uncle. Sitting at your feet - always
sitting at somebody’s feet - trying to learn. The right way to hold a
teacup, otherwise you’re out, the pukkah knot in your tie - as if
everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an accent.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Kip -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Kip! - it’s not even my name because you can’t
say it. Kirpal Singh Bhuller is my name.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Well, then ask him his name!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: What’s happened? Kip! What’s happening? Don’t
shoot, please, don’t shoot anybody.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: They’re excited! They’re happy about destroying
a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man’s City? Never!</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Go on, do it. I don’t need to hear any
more.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Kip, listen, he lost everything because
he wasn’t English - Jesus! - shoot me, I’m more English than he is!</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kip. Kip. It’s me. Why? It’s another bomb.
However big, what’s the difference? There’ve been so many bombs. What
about Coventry? What about Dresden? Where were those cities? I don’t
understand. Let me come in.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Of course. When?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I mean home. India.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Kip… I -</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I know - here I am always a brown man, there
you would be always a white woman.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Is that what you think? Is that what you think
I think?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It’s what I’ve learned.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’m thinking about your heart, not your skin.
And how to reach it. And that I don’t think I can. A bomb has ruined us,
just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’ve clung to you. I’ve clung to you. Kip.
Life a raft.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Then come with me.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I’ll always go back to that church. Look at my
painting.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I’ll always go back to that church.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: So one day we’ll meet.</p>
<p><strong>two more towards her. their eyes meet, then he shovels
another, then</strong>: ALL OF THEM. She looks at him. IT’S A MASSIVE,
LETHAL DOSE.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the patient</strong>: Read to me, will you? Read me to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: Katharine, my darling.</p>
<p><strong>alm�sy</strong>: I’m so tired.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: My darling, I’m waiting for you - how long is
a day in the dark, or a week?</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: …the fire is gone now, and I’m horribly
cold. I really ought to drag myself outside but then there would be the
sun…</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: I’m afraid I waste the light on the
paintings and on writing these words…</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: We die, we die rich with lovers and
tribes, tastes we have swallowed…</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Hana! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: …bodies we have entered and swum up like
rivers, fears we have hidden in like this wretched cave…</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: …I want all this marked on my body. We
are the real countries, not the boundaries drawn on maps with the names
of powerful men…</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: Hana - this is Gioia.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: Buon’ giorno.</p>
<p><strong>caravaggio</strong>: She can take you as far as Florence.</p>
<p><strong>hana</strong>: I can get in the back.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: …I know you will come and carry me out
into the palace of winds, the rumors of water… That’s all I’ve wanted -
to walk in such a place with you, with friends, on earth without
maps.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cockpit</strong>: THE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF
THE FILM. Alm�sy obliterated by goggles and helmet. Katharine behind
him, slumped forwards as if sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>katharine</strong>: The lamp’s gone out and I’m writing in
the darkness…</p>
