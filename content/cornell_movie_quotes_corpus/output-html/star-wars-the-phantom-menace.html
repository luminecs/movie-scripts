<p><strong>title card</strong>: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far
away….</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Tell them we wish to board at once.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: With all due respect for the Trade
Federation, the Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Yes, yes, of coarse…ahhh…as you know, our
blockade is perfectly legal, and we’d be happy to recieve the
Ambassador…Happy to.</p>
<p><strong>pk-4</strong>: They must be important if the Viceroy sent one
of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them.</p>
<p><strong>tc-14</strong>: I’m TC-14 at your service. This way,
please.</p>
<p><strong>eg-9</strong>: A Republic cruiser! That’s trouble…don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>pr-4</strong>: I’m not made to think.</p>
<p><strong>tc-14</strong>: I hope you honoured sirs with the most
comfortable here. My master will be with you shortly.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I don’t sense anything.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s not about the mission, Master, it’s
somethging…elsewhere…elusive.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Don’t center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep
your concentration here and now where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the
future…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: …..but not at the expense of the moment. Be
mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes, Master…how do you think the trade
viceroy will deal with the chancellor’s demands?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: These Federation types are cowards. The
negotiations will be short.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: What?!? What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>tc-14</strong>: The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I
believe.</p>
<p><strong>dofine</strong>: I knew it! They were sent to force a
settlement, eh. Blind me, we’re done for!</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: They must be dead by now. Blast, what’s left
of them.</p>
<p><strong>tc14</strong>: Oh, excuse me, so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>owo-1</strong>: Not sure exactly what…</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: What in blazes is going on down there?</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight
before, sir?</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Well, not exactly, but I don’t… Seal off the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: That won’t be enough, sir.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: We will not survive this.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Close the blast doors!!!</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: …They’re still coming through!</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Impossible!! This is impossible!!</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: Where are those destroyer droids?!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Destroyer droids!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Offhand, I’d say this mission is past the
negotiaion stage.</p>
<p><strong>p-59</strong>: Switch to bio…There they are!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: They have shield generators!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It’s a standoff! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: We have them on the run, sir…they’re no match
for destroyer droids.</p>
<p><strong>tey how</strong>: Sir, they’ve gone up the ventilation
shaft.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Battle droids.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s an invisible army.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It’s an odd play for the Trade Federation.
We’ve got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let’s split
up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: You were right about one thing, Master. The
negotiations were short.</p>
<p><strong>tey how</strong>: Sir, a transmission from the planet.</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: It’s Queen Amidala herself.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: At last we’re getting results.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Again you come before me, Your highness. The
Federation is pleased.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: You will not be pleased when you hear what
I have to say, Viceroy…Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: I was not aware of such a failure.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I have word that the Senate is finally
voting on this blockade of yours.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why
they bother to vote.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I’m aware
the Chancellor’s Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have
beencommanded to reach a settlement.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: I know nothing about any Ambassadors…you must
be mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Beware, Viceroy….the Federation is going
too far this time.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Your Highness, we would never do anything
without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: We will see.</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: She’s right, the Senate will never….</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: It’s too late now.</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: Do you think she suspects an attack?</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: I don’t know, but we must move quickly to
disrupt all communications down there.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: …How could that be true? I have
assurances from the Chancellor…his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
the…get…negotiate…</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Senator Palpatine?!? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Check the transmission generators…</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: A malfunction?</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: It could be the Federation jamming us.
Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: A communications disruption can only mean
one thing. Invasion.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Don’t jump to conclusions, Governor. The
Federation would not dare go that far.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: The Senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they’d be finished.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: We must continue to rely on
negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: Negotiation? We’ve lost all
communications!…and where atre the Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we
negotiate? We must prepare to defend ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: This is a dangerous situation, Your
Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a
battle-hardened Federation army.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I will not condone a course of action that
will lead us to war.</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: …and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may
have gotton onto one of your landing craft.</p>
<p><strong>oom-9</strong>: If they are down here, sir, we’ll find them.
We are moving out of the swamp and are marching on the cities. We are
meeting no resistance.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Oh, noooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Hey, help me! Help me!!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Are you brainless? You almost got us
killed!</p>

intelligent. Now get outta here!</p>

<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Stay down!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: …dieeee!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Sorry, Master, the water fried my
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You forgot to turn your power off again,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It won’t take long to recharge, but this is
a lesson I hope you’ve learned, my young Padawan.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>

grind us into little pieces, then blast us into oblivion!</p>

<p><strong>nute</strong>: The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Good. I have the Senate bogged down
in procedures. By the time this incident comes up for a vote, they will
have no choice but to accept your control of the system.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: The Queen has great faith the Senate will side
with her.</p>

<p><strong>battle droid 3b3</strong>: Drop your weapons!</p>
<p><strong>battle droid 3b3</strong>: I said drop your weapons</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Whoa!!!</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: …how will you explain this invasion to the
Senate?</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: The Naboo and the Federation will forge a
treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I’ve been assured it
will be ratified by the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I will not co-operate.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to
like what we have in store for your people. In time, their suffering
will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander. Process them.</p>
<p><strong>oom-9</strong>: Yes, sir! Take them to Camp Four.</p>
<p><strong>bibble,</strong>: and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace
by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS,
which they pass on their way to the detention camp. Unbeknownst to them,
QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak across on a walkway above the plaza
and jump from a balcony to begin an attack to rescue the QUEEN.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Yousa guys bombad!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for
the Supreme Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: Your negotiations seem to have failed,
Ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The negotiations never took place. Your
Highness, we must make contact with the republic.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: They’ve knocked out all our
communications.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Do you have transports?</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: In the main hanger. This way.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: There are too many of them.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: That won’t be a problem. Your Highness,
under the circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here
with my people.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: They will kill you if you stay.</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: They wouldn’t dare.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: They need her to sign a treaty to make
this invasion of theirs legal. They can’t afford to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The situation here is not what it seems.
There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no
logic in the Federation’s move here. My feelings tell me they will
destroy you.</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only
hope is for the Senate to side with us… Senator Palpatine will need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Getting past their blockade is
impossible, Your Highness. Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: Your Highness, I will stay here and do what
I can…They will have to retain the Council of Governors in order to
maintain control. But you must leave…</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Either choice presents a great risk…to all
of us…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: We are brave, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must
be now.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Then, I will plead our case before the
Senate. Be careful, Governor.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: We need to free those pilots.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’ll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads
toward the group of captured pilots.</p>
<p><strong>guard droid</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’m Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor,
and I’m taking those people to Coruscant.</p>
<p><strong>droid guard</strong>: You’re under arrest!</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: ….our communications are still jammed.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Ello, boyos. Disa wanna longo trip…hey?</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Tis opens?…Oooops! Many springs and things
come flying out.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Yoi! Just yoken!</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: Powers back! That little droid did it. He
bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: There’s not enough power to get us to
Coruscant…the hyperdrive is leaking.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: We’ll have to land somewhere to refuel and
repair the ship.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Here, Master. Tatooine… It’s small, out of
the way, poor… The Trade Federation has no presence there.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: How can you be sure?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It’s controlled by the Hutts…</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: The Hutts??</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s risky…but there’s no alternative.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: You can’t take Her Royal Highness
there! The Hutts are gangsters… If they discovered her…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: …It would be no different than if we landed
on a system controlled by the Federation…except the Hutts aren’t looking
for her, which gives us an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: We control all the cities in the North and are
searching for any other settlements…</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Destroy all high-ranking officials,
Viceroy…slowly…quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the
treaty?</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo
cruiser got pat the blockade.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty
signed.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: My Lord, it’s impossible to locate the ship.
It’s out of our range.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: …not for a Sith…</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: …Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord
Maul. He will find your lost ship.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: This is getting out of hand…now there are two
of them.</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: We should not have made this bargain. What
will happen when the Jedi become aware of these Sith Lords?</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: …An extremely well put together little
droid. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: It is to be commended…what is its
number?</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: R2-D2, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to
be very loyal…Padme!</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Clean this droid up the best you can. It
deserves our gratitude… Continue, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote
planet called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade
Federation. There we will be able to make needed repairs, then travel on
to Coruscant.</p>
<p><strong>captain panaka</strong>: Your Highness, Tatooine is very
dangerous. It’s controlled by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I
do not agree with the Jedi on this.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You must trust my judgement, Your
Highness.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Hidoe!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Thank you. This little guy is quite a
mess.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Mesa Ja Ja Binksss… PADME : I’m Padme, I
attend Her Highness, You’re a Gungan, aren’t you? How did you end up
here with us?</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Me no know…mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen. Den boom….getten berry skeered, un grabbed
dat Jedi, and before mesa knowen it…pow! Mesa here. …getten berry berry
skeered.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Tahyt’s it. Tatooine.</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: There’s a settlement…a spaceport, looks
like.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Land near the outskirts. We don’t want to
attract any attention.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Sorry, Qui-Gon’s right. You’ll make things
less obvious.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will
need a new one.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Don’t let them send ant transmissions. Be
wary…I sense a disturbance in the Force.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I fell it also, Master.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Dis sun doen murder tada skin.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Her Highness commands you to take her
handmaiden with you. She wishes for her to observe the local…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: No more commands from Her Highness today,
Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant…</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: The Queen wishes it. She is curious
about this planet.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’ve been trained in defense… I can take care
of myself.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Don’t make me go back and tell her you
refuse.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I don’t have time to argue. But this is not
a good idea. Stay close to me.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: …moisture farms for the most part, but also
a few indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one
are havens for those who do not wish to be found…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: ….like us. JAR JAR is in a constant state of
panic.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Dissen berry berry bad.
Ooooh…icky…icky…goo.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: We’ll try one of the smaller dealers.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Hi chuba da naga?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that.
What kinda junk? Peedenkel! Naba dee unko</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: My droid here has a readout of what I
need.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Coona tee-tocky malia?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Mel tassa cho-passa…</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. Me dwana no
bata. Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you’ll find what you
need.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Don’t touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Are you an angel?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: An angel. I’ve heard the deep space pilots
talk about them. They live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the
most beautiful creatures in the universe. They are good and kind, and so
pretty they make even the most hardened spice pirate cry.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You must be one…maybe you just don’t know
it.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re a funny little boy. How do you know so
much?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Since I was very little, three, I think. My
Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on
the Podraces, to Watto, who’s a lot better master than Gardulla, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re…a slave?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I am a person! My name is Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t fully understand. This is
a strange world to me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You are a strange girl to me.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hit the nose!</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: …Here it is…a T-14 hyperdrive generator!!
Thee in luck, I’m the only one hereabouts who has one…but thee might as
well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think…Sying of which, how’s
thee going to pay for all this?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I have 20,000 Republic dataries.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no
good out here. I need something more real…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I don’t have anything else. But credits
will do fine.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: No they won’ta. QUI-GON, using his mind
power, waves his hand again.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Credits will do fine.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: No, they won’ta. What you think you’re some
kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I’m a Toydarian. Mind
tricks don’ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no
one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …wouldn’t have lasted long if I weren’t so
good at fixing things. I’m making my own droid…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m glad I met you,….ah…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Anakin.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Anakin Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Padme Naberrie.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m glad I met you too.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na
nolia.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: La lova num botaffa. WATTO : Fweepa niaga.
Tolpa da bunky dunko.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: …Obi-Wan, you’re sure there isn’t anything
of value left on board?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: A few containers of supplies, the Queen’s
wardrobe, maybe. Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts
you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: All right. Another solution will present
itself. I’ll check back.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Noah gain…da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa
be robbed un crunched.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Not likely. We have nothing of value,
that’s our problem.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Hey, that will be seven truguts!!</p>
<p><strong>sebulba</strong>: Chuba!! JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA : Ni
chuba na??</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Why mesa always da one??</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Because you’re afraid.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Chess ko, Sebulba…Coo wolpa tooney rana.</p>
<p><strong>sebulba</strong>: Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Oh da Hutt…cha porko ootman geesa…me teesa
rodda co pana pee choppa chawa.</p>
<p><strong>sebulba</strong>: Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee
Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Eh, chee bana do mullee ra.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned
into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous
Dug called Sebulba.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat’s da
last ting mesa wanten.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Nevertheless, the boy is right…you were
heading for trouble. Thank you, my young friend.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Mesa doen nutten!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to
overcome his fear by squashing you…be less afraid.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: And that works for you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: To a point.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: This storm’s going to slow them down.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: It looks pretty bad. We’d better seal
the ship.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Yes? CAPT. PANAKA : We’ll be right
there.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: How are you feeling today, Jira?</p>
<p><strong>jira</strong>: The heat’s never been kind to me, you know,
Annie!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Guess what? I’ve found that cooling unit
I’ve been searching for. It’s pretty beat up, but I’ll have it fixed up
for you in no time, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jira</strong>: You’re a fine boy, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ll take four pallies today. You’ll like
these…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Whoops, I thought I had more…Make thgat
three, I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jira</strong>: Gracious, my bones are aching…storm’s coming
on, Annie. You’d better get home quick.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Do you have shelter?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: We’ll hed back to our ship.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Is it far?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: On the outskirts.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You’ll never reach the outskirts in
time…sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Mom! Mom! I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Dissen cozy.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Oh, my!! Annie, what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme,
and…gee, I don’t know any of your names.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’m Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar
Binks. ARTOO lets out a little beep.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: …and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m building a droid. You wanna see?</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Anakin! Why are they here?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Your son was kind enough to offer us
shelter.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Come on! Let me show you Threepio!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I have enough food for a meal.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I’m sorry if
I was abrupt. I’ll never get used to Anakin’s surprises.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: He’s a very special boy. SHMI looks at him
as if he’s discovered a secret.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Isn’t he great?! He’s not finished yet.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He’s wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You reall like him? He’s a protocol droid…to
help Mom. Watch!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human
Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: When the storm is over, you can see my
racer. I’m building a Podracer!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I beg your pardon….what do you mean I’m
naked?</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How
embarrassing!</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: …cut off all food supplies until you
return…the death toll is catastrophic…we must bow to their wishes, Your
Highness…Please tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness,
you must contact me…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It’s a trick. Send no reply… Send no
transmission of any kind.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: …the Queen is upset…but absolutly no reply
was sent.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It sounds like bait to establish a
connection trace.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What if it is true and the people are
dying?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Either way, we’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>darth maul</strong>: Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the
trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Move against the Jedi first…you will
then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will
sign the treaty.</p>
<p><strong>darth maul</strong>: At last we will reveal ourselves to the
Jedi. At last we will have revenge.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: You have been well trained, my young
apprentice, they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to
stop us now. Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be
in my command.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: All slaves have transmitters placed inside
their bodies somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve been working on a scanner to try and
locate them, but no luck.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Any attempt to escape…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …and they blow you up…poof!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: How wude.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I can’t believe there is still slavery in the
galaxy. The Republic’s anti-slavery laws…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: The Republic doesn’t exist out here…we must
survive on our own.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Have you ever seen a Podrace?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: They have Podracing on Malastare. Very
fast, very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m the only human who can do it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Mom, what? I’m not bragging. It’s true.
Watto says he’s never heard of a human doing it.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You must have Jedi reflexes if you race
Pods.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Don’t do that again.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I…I was wondering…something…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, ahhh…you’re a Jedi Knight, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: What makes you think that?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that
kind of weapon.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from
him.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t think so… No one can kill a Jedi
Knight.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I wish that were so… ANAKIN. I had a dream
I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves…have you come to
free us?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: No, I’m afraid not…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I think you have…why else would you be
here?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I can see there’s no fooling you… You
mustn’t let anyone know about us…we’re on our way to Coruscant, the
central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must
be kept secret.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Coruscant…wow…how did you end up here in the
outer rim?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Our ship was damaged, and we’re stranded here
until we can repair it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I can help! I can fix anything!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I believe you can, but our first job is to
aquire the parts we need…</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Wit no-nutten mula to trade.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: These junk dealers must have a weakness of
some kind.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Gambling. Everything here revolves around
betting on those awful races.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Podracing… Greed can be a powerful ally..
if it’s used properly.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve built a racer! It’s the fastest
ever…There’s a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod.
It’s all but finished…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Anakin, settle down. Watto won’t let you…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Watto doesn’t know I’ve built it. You could
make him think it’s your’s, and you could get him to let me pilot it for
you.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: I don’t want you to race, Annie…It’s awful. I
die every time Watto makes you do it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: But Mom, I love it…and they need
help…they’re in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the
parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina pitty bad goo.</p>
<p><strong>gui-gon</strong>: Your mother’s right. Is there anyone
friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We have to help them, Mom…you said that the
biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Anakin, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I’m sure Qui-Gon doesn’t want to put your son
in danger. We will find another way…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: No, Annie’s right, there is no other way… I
may not like it, but he can help you…he was meant to help you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Is that a yes? That is a yes!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to
a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The Queen does not need to know.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Well, I don’t approve.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Patta go bolla!</p>
<p><strong>ankain</strong>: No batta!</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Bayno, Bayno!</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa
race. You can’t afford parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic
credits, I think.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: My ship will be the entry fee.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Not bad…not bad…a Nubian.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It’s in good order, except for the parts we
need.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: …but what would the boy ride? He smashed up
my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Ahhhh….it wasn’t my fault really…Sebulba
flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod…mostly.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: That you did. The boy is good, no doubts
there.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I have…acquired a Pod in a game of chance.
“The fastest ever built.”</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: I hope you didn’t kill anyone I know for it.
So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the
winnings fifty-fifty, I think.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Fifty-fifty!?! If it’s going to be
fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you
keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need…If we lose,
you keep my ship.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Either way, you win.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What if this plan fails, Master? We could
be stuck here for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: A ship without a power supply will not get
us anywhere, and there is something about this boy…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You should be proud of your son. He gives
without any thought of reward.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: He knows nothing of greed. He has…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: He has special powers.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: He can see things before they happen.
That’s why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi
trait.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: He deserves better than a slave’s life.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The Force is unusally strong with him, that
much is clear. Who was his father?</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: There was no father, that I know of…I carried
him, I gave him birth…I can’t explain what happened. Can you help
him?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’m afraid not. Had he been born in the
Republic, we would have identified him early, and he would have become
Jedi, no doubt…he has the way. But it’s too late for him now, he’s too
old.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend
Kitster, and seek, Amee, and Wald.</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: Wow, a real Astro Droid…how’d you get so
lucky?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: This isn’t the half of it. I’m entered in
the Boonta Race tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: What? With this??</p>
<p><strong>amee</strong>: You’ve been working on that thing for years.
It’s never going to run.</p>
<p><strong>seek</strong>: Come on, let’s go play ball. Keep it up,
Annie, and you’re gonna be bug squash.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy
binders…</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Who, mesa?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: If your hand gets caught in that beam, it
will go numb for hours.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho.</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: But you don’t even know if this thing will
run.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It will.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I think it’s time we found out. Use this
power charge. ANAKIN : Yes, sir!!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this
cut.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: There are so many! Do they all have a system
of planets?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Most of them.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Has anyone been to them all?</p>
<p><strong>qu-ig0n</strong>: Not likely.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I want to be the first one to see them all…
Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: There, good as new…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Annie, bedtime!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Checking your blood for infections.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve never seen…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Annie! I’m not goiung to tell you again!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Go on, you have a big day tomorrow.
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Obi-Wan…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes, Master.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Make an analysis of this blood sample I’m
sending you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I need a midi-chlorian count.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: All right. I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: What are your readings?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Something must be wrong with the
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Here’s a signal check.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Strange. The transmission seems to be in
good order, but the reading’s off the chart…over twenty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: That’s it then.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Even Master Yoda doesn’t have a
midi-chlorian count that high!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: No Jedi has.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I hope you’re about finished.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You were in my dream…you were leading a huge
army into battle.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother
wants you to come in and clean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands
up and stretches just as KITSTER arrives.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hook ’em up, Kitster. I won’t be long.
Where’s Qui-Gon?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He and Jar Jar left already. They’re with
Watto at the arena.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: …I want to see your spaceship the moment the
race is over.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Patienc, my blue friend. You’ll have your
winnings before the suns set, and we’ll be far away from here.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Not if your ship belongs to me, I think…I
warn you, no funny business.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You don’t think Anakin will win?</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Don’t get me wrongo. I have great faith in
the boy. He’s a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win,
I think.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: He always wins. I’m betting heavily on
Sebulba.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’ll take that bet.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: What??!! What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’ll wager my new racing pod
against…say…the boy and his mother.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: A Pod for slaves. I don’t think so…well,
poerhaps. Just one…the mother, maybe…the boy isn’t for sale.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The boy is small, he can’t be worth
much.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: For the fastest Pod ever built?!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Both, or no bet.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: No Pod’s worth two slaves…not by a long
shot…one slave or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The boy, then…</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: We’ll let fate decide. Blue it’s the boy, red
his mother…</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: You won the small toss, outlander, bou you
won’t win the race, so…it makes little difference.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee
chobodd.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What did he mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’ll tell you later.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Oh my! Space travel sounds rather
perilous.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: I can assure you they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships!</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: This is so wizard! I’m sure you’ll do it
this time, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: Finish the race, of course!</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’ve never won a race?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well…not exactly…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Not even finished?!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …but Kitster’s right, I will this time.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Of course you will.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: A: Toogi! Toogie! Toong mee cha
kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos azalus ooval Poddraces.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: That’s absolutly right. And a big turnout here,
from all corners of the Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are
making their way out onto the starting grid.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: A : La Yma beestoo</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: …eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia!</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Two time winner, Boles Roor…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du
Pixelito! Splastyleeya bookie ookie!!</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local
boy.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Wampa peedunkee unko</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: A : O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt,
amu intoe tah parena.</p>
<p><strong>jabba</strong>: Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee
madda hodrudda du wundee. Sebulba tuta Pixelito…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Be safe.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I will, Mom. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jabba</strong>: …Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta
Moonus Mandel, Anakin SKywalker tuta Tatoonine….</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be
kind, mesa palo.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You carry all our hopes.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I won’t let you down.</p>
<p><strong>sebulba</strong>: Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to
Bantha poodoo. 9You</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo.</p>
<p><strong>jabba</strong>: …Ka bazza kundee hodrudda!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Are you all set, Annie? Remember,
concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don’t think. Trust your instincts. May
the Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee!</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Hey, it looks like they’re clearing the grid.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Is he nervous?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: He’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The Queen trusts my judgment, young
handmaiden. You should too.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You assume too much.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : Start your engines.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: A : An dare ovv!</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Oh…wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : And there goes Skywalker… He’ll
be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders today.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders
have campe out on the canyon dune turn.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Where’s Skywalker?</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B ; There goes Quadinaros’ power
couplings.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata!</p>
<p><strong>fanta</strong>: Bug off.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: He musta crash-ud.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: He has to complete two more circuits? Oh
dear!</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : It looks like Skywalker is moving
up through the field. He’s in…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Steeth pa nagoola!</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda
dunko!</p>
<p><strong>ody</strong>: Droids!</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B :At the start of the third and
final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely followed by Skywalker…</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : Skywalker is forced onto the
service ramp!</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Oh noah!</p>
<p><strong>fode beed : -</strong>: B : Amazing… a controlled thrust and
he’s back on course! What a move!</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : He’s catching Sebulba.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Inkabunga.</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : That little human being is out of
his mind.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Punda tah punda!</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: They’re side by side!</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Bongo du bongu!</p>
<p><strong>fode/beed : -</strong>: B : It’s Skywalker! The crowd are
going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was
going to win! Somehow you knew it! I lost everything.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Whenever you gamble, my freind, eventually
you’ll lose. Bring the parts to the main hanger. I’ll come by your shop
later so you can release the boy.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: You can’t have him! It wasn’t a fair bet!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Would you like to discuss it with the
Hutts…I’m sure they can settle this.</p>
<p><strong>watto</strong>: No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take
him!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Ah, gee…enough of this…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: It’s so wonderful, Annie. You have brought
hope to those who have none. I’m so very proud of you…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: We owe you everything.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Just feeling this good was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Padme. Jar Jar, let’s go, we’ve got to get
these parts back to the ship.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I’ll return the eopies by midday.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Start getting this hyperdrive generator
installed. I’m going back…some unfinished business. I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Why do I sense we’ve picked up another
pathetic life form…?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It’s the boy who’s responsible for getting
those parts.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: He said I cheated.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Do you still think he cheated?</p>
<p><strong>greedo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Well, Annie. You know the truth… You will
have to tolerate his opinion, fighting won’t change it.</p>
<p><strong>wald</strong>: Keep this up, Greedo, and you’re gonna come to
a bad end.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: These are yours. We sold the Pod.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money
we have!</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Oh, my goodness, That’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: And Anakin has been freed.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You’re no longer a slave.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Did you hear that, Mom? Was that part of the
prize, or what?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Let’s just say Watto has learned an
important lesson about gambling.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie.
You’re free! Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing
happens by accident. You are strong with the Force, but you may not be
accepted by the Coucil.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to
go with you in your starship and everything?!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a
easy challenge. And if you succeed, it will be a hard life.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: But it’s what I want. What I’ve always
dreamed about. Can I go, Mom?!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: This path has been placed for you, Annie;
the choice to take it is yours alone.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I want to go.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Then, pack your things. We haven’t much
time.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yipee!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What about Mom? Is she free too? You’re
coming, aren’t you, Mom</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I tried to free your mother, Annie, but
Watto wouldn’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: But the money from selling…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It’s not nearly enough.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Son, my place is here. My future is here. It
is time for you to let go…to let go of me. I cannot go with you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I want to stay with you. I don’t want things
to change.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: You can’t stop change any more than you can
stop the suns from setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know
what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m going to miss you so much, Mom…</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: I love you, Annie…now hurry.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I will watch after him. You have my word.
Will you be all right?</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: He was in my life for such a short time.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well, Threepio, I’m free…and I’m going
away…in a starship…</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I
wish you well. Although I’d like it better if I were a little less
naked.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m sorry I wasn’t able to finish you,
Threepio…give you coverings and all… I’m going to miss working on you.
You’ve been a great pal. I’ll make sure Mom doesn’t sell you or
anything. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>threepio</strong>: Sell me?!?</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: There are so many of us who want you to
stay, Annie… You’re a hero.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I… I… have to go.</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>kitster</strong>: Thank’s for every moment you’ve been here.
You’re my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I won’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I can’t do it, Mom. I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Annie, remember when you climbed the great
dune in order to chase the Banthas away so they wouldn’t be shot…
Remember how you collapses several times, exhausted thinking you
couldn’t do it?</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: This is one of those times when you have to do
something you don’t think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie.
I know you can do this…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Will I ever see you again?</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: What does your heart tell you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I hope so…yes…I guess.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: Then we will see each other again.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back
and free you, Mom…I promise.</p>
<p><strong>shmi</strong>: No matter where you are, my love will be with
you. Now be brave, and don’t look back… don’t look back.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve been freed, and I’m going away. Buy
yourself a cooling unit with this… Otherwise I’ll worry about you.</p>
<p><strong>jira</strong>: Can I give you a hug</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jira</strong>: I’ll miss you, Annie.. there isn’t a kinder
boy in the galaxy. You be careful…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Probe droid. Very unusual… not like
anything I’ve seen before. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Anakin, drop!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon.</strong>: ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic
warriors, Sith and Jedi, are bashing each other with incredible blows.
They move in a continual cloudof dust, smashing everything around them.
This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets up, bewildered by the
confrontation.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go!
Go!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Qui-Gon’s in trouble. He says to take
off…now!!</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: He’s a friend.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take
off!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Over there! Fly low!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I think so… that was a surpirse I wont soon
forget.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I don’t know… but he was well trained in
the Jedi arts. My guess is he was after the Queen…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Do you think he’ll follow us?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: We’ll be safe enough once we’re in
hyperspace, but I have no doubt he knows our destination.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What are we going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet
Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Pleased to meet you. Wow! You’re a Jedi
too?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Let’s hope this hyperdrive works and Watto
didn’t get the last laugh.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: When are you going to give up this pointless
strike? Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor,
are going to die, much sooner than your people, I’m afraid. Take him
away!</p>
<p><strong>bibble</strong>: This invasion will gain you nothing. We’re a
democracy. The people have decided… They will not live under your
tyranny.</p>
<p><strong>oom-9</strong>: My troops are in position to begin searching
the swamps for these rumored underwater villages… they will not stay
hidden for long.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: It’s very cold.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: You’re from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm
for my taste. Space is cold.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: You seem sad.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: The Queen is…worried. Her people are
suffering…dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, or…I’m not
sure what will happen.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m…I’m not sure what’s going to happen to
me. I dunno if I’ll ever see you again.. I made this for you. Sou you’d
remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet… It will bring you good
fortune.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: It’s beautiful, but I don’t need this to
remember you. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Annie.
My caring for you will always remain.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I care for you too. Only I…miss…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: …You miss your mother.</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: Coruscant…the capital of the Republic…the
entire planet is one big city.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Wow! It’s so huge!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: It is a great gift to see you alive, Your
Majesty. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to
finally meet you in person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone
is over the currant situation. I’ve called for a special session of the
Senate to hear your position.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I am grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: There is a question of precedure, but I
feel confident we can overcome it…</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks.
Pitty hot!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I must speak with the Jei Council
immediately, Your Honor. The situation has become more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Dissen all pitty odd to my.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Don’t look at me. I don’t know what’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: …the Republic is not what it once was.
The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking
out for themselves and their home sytems. There is no interest in the
common good…no civility, only politics…its disgusting. I must be frank,
Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the
invasion.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is
hope.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: If I may say so, Your Majesty, the
Chancellor has little real power…he is mired down by baseless
accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The
bureaucrats are in charge now.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: What options do we have?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Our best choice would be to push for the
election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of
the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call
for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: He has been our strongest supporter. Is
there any other way?</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Our only other choice would to be to
submit a plea to the courts…</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: There’s no time for that. The courts take
even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying,
Senator…more and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the
Federation.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: To be realistic, Your Highness, I’d say
we’re going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: There is something I cannot do.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: …my only conclusion can be that it was a
Sith Lord.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: A Sith Lord?!?</p>
<p><strong>ki-adi</strong>: Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a
millenium.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: The very Republic is threatened, if involved
the Sith are.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: I do not believe they could have
returned without us knowing.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who
this assassin is, we must.</p>
<p><strong>ki-adi</strong>: I sense he will reveal himself again.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: This attack was with purpose, that is
clear, and I agree the Queen is the target.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon.
Protect her.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: We will use all our resources here to
unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker… May the
Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: May the Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: With your permission, my Master. I have
encountered a vergence in the Force.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: A vergence, you say?</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Located around a person?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: A boy… his cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is
possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: You’re referring to the prophesy of the
one who will bring balance to the Force…you believe it’s this boy??</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I don’t pressume…</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I request the boy be tested.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Finding him was the will of the Force…I
have no doubt of that. There is too much happening here…</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Bring him before us, then.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Tested he will be.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: May I help you, son?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m…I’m looking for the handmaiden,
Padme.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The boy is here to see Padme.</p>
<p><strong>rabe</strong>: Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’d like to speak with Padme, if I
could.</p>
<p><strong>rabe</strong>: I’m sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right
now.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>rabe</strong>: Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your
Highness.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I’ve sent Padme on an errand.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m going to the Jedi temple to start my
training, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I may not see her again…and… I just wanted
to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: We will tell her for you. We’re sure her
heart goes with you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Thank you, Your Highness. I’m sorry to have
disturbed you.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: If the Federation moves to defer the
motion…Your Majesty, Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this
congressional session.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I wish I had your confidence in this,
Senator.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You must force a new election for Supreme
Chancellor…I promise you there are many who will support us…it is our
best chance… Your Majesty, our only, chance.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will
not bring our motion to a vote?</p>
<p><strong>palapatine</strong>: He is distracted…he is afraid. He will
be of no help.</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: The Chair recognizes the Senator from the
sovereign system of Naboo.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the
Senate. A tragedy has occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have
become caugt in a dispute you’re all well aware of, which began right
here with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire
planet in the oppresion of the Trade Federation.</p>
<p><strong>lott dod</strong>: This is outrageous! I object to the
Senator’s statements!</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: The Chair does not recognize the Senator
from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your
station.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: To state our allegations, I present Queen
Amidala, the recently elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our
behalf.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Honorable representatives of the Republic,
distinguished delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I
come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has
been invaded by force. Invaded…against all the laws of the Republic by
the Droid Armies of the Trade…</p>
<p><strong>lott dod</strong>: I object! There is no proof. This is
incredible. We recommend a commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: Overruled.</p>
<p><strong>lott dod</strong>: Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be
condemned without reasonable observation. It’s against all the rules of
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>aks moe</strong>: The Congress of Malastare concurs with the
honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commision must be
appointed…that is the law.</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: The point…</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of
the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add.
This is where Chancellor Valorum’s strength will dissapear.</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: The point is conceded…Section 523A take
precedence here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion
to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I will not defer…I have come before you to
resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee.
If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is
needed. I move for a “vote of no confidence”…in Chancellor Valorum’s
leadership.</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: What?…No!</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Order! We shall have order…</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote
of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.</p>
<p><strong>mad amedda</strong>: The motion has been seconded by Bail
Organa of Alderaan.</p>
<p><strong>bail organa</strong>: There must be no delays. The motion is
on the floor and must be voted upon in this session.</p>
<p><strong>lott dod</strong>: The Trade Federation moves the motion be
sent to the procedures committee for study.</p>
<p><strong>assembly</strong>: Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with
us…Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new
Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy
continue…</p>
<p><strong>mas amedda</strong>: Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a
recess. Tomorrow we will begin the vote.</p>
<p><strong>valorum</strong>: Palpatine, I thought you were my ally…my
friend. You have betrayed me! How could you do this?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The boy will not pass the Council’s tests,
Master, and you know it. He is far too old.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Anakin will become A Jedi…I promise
you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Don’t defy the Council, Master..not
again.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I will do what I must.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Master, you could be sitting on the Council
by now if you would just follow the code. They will not go along with
you this time.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You still have much to learn, my young
apprentice.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: A ship…a cup…a speeder.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Good, good, young one. How feel you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Cold, sir.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Afraid are you?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Afraid to give up your life?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: See through you, we can.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Be mindful of your feelings…</p>
<p><strong>ki-adi</strong>: YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I miss her.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Afraid to lose her..I think.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What’s that got to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side…
fear leads to anger… anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I am not afraid!</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the
most serious mind. I sense much fear in you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I am not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Then continue, we will.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: To motivate us, I imagine…</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Gungans do die’n without a fight…. wesa
warriors. Wesa gotta grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has
been nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome
one. I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy
back to the Republic. I will put an end to corruption. The Trade
Fedreation will lose its influence over the bureaucrats, and our people
will be freed.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Who else can be nominated?</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee
Teem of Malastare.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I feel confident…our “situation” will
create a strong sympaphy vote for us… I will be Chancellor, I promise
you.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I fear by the time you have control of the
bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our cities, our
people, our way of life…</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: I understand your concern, Your Majesty;
unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet. The law is
in their favor.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: With the Senate in transition, there is
nothing more I can do here…Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must
return to mine. I have decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my
people.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be
realistic! You would be in danger. They will force you to sign the
treaty.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate
will be no different from that of our people. Captain!</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Yes, Your Highness?</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Ready my ship!</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Please, Your Majesty, stay here…where
it’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: No place is safe, if the Senate doesn’t
condemn this invasion. It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer
functions as a democracy. If you win the election, Senator, I know you
will do everything possible to stop the Federation. I pray you will
bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: …Correct you were, Qui-Gon.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: His cells contain a high concentration
of midi-chlorians.</p>
<p><strong>ki-adi</strong>: The Force is strong with him.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: He’s to be trained, then.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: No. He will not be trained.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: No??!!</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: He is too old. There is already too much
anger in him.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: He is the chosen one…you must see it.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Clouded, this boy’s future is. Masked by his
youth.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my
Padawan learner.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible,
to take on a second.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: We forbid it.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Obi-Wan is ready…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Iam ready to face the trials.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Ready so early, are you? What know you of
ready?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Headstrong….and he has much to learn about
the living Force, but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn
from me.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Our own council we will keep on who is ready.
More to learn, he has…</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Now is not the time for this…the Senate
is voting for a new Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home,
which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the
confrontation.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: And draw out the Queen’s attacker.</p>
<p><strong>ki-adi</strong>: Events are moving fast…too fast.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel
this mystery of the Sith.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Young Skywalker’s fate will be decided
later.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my
charge. He has nowhere else to go.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: He is your ward, Qui-Gon…we will not
dispute that.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Train him not. Take him with you, but train
him not!</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: Protect the Queen, but do not intercede
if it comes to war until we have the Senate’s approval.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: May the Force be with you.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: It is not disrespect, Master, it is the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: From your point of view….</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The boy is dangerous…they all sense it. Why
can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The
Council will decide Anakin’s future…that should be enough for you. Now
get on board! OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed
by ARTOO. QUI-GON goes over to ANAKIN.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You won’t be, Annie….I’m not allowed to
train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful…always remember,
your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you will be
safe.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Master, sir…I’ve been wondering…what are
midi-chlorians?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform
that reside within all living cells and communicates with the Force.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They live inside of me?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: In your cells. We are symbionts with the
midi-chlorians.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Symbionts?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Life forms living together for mutual
advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we
would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to you,
telling you the will of the Force.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: They do??</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: When you learn to quiet your mind, you will
hear them speaking to you.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: With time and training, Annie…you will.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Your Highness, it is our pleasure to
continue to serve and protect you.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine
fears the Federation means to destroy me.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I promise you, I will not let that
happen.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Wesa goen home!</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: The Queen is on her way to you. I
regret she is of no further use to us. When she gets there, destroy
her.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Viceroy, is the planet secure?</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last
pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the
planet now.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Good. I will see to it that in the
Senate, things stay as they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He
will deal with the Jedi.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: A Sith lord here with us?!!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …and that one?</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: The forward stabalizer.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: And those control the pitch?</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: You catch on pretty quick.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: The moment we land the Federation will
arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I agree…I’m not sure what you hope to
accomplish by this.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I’m going to take back what’s ours.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: There are only twelve of us, Your
Highness….we have no army.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I cannot fight a war for you, Your
Highness, only protect you.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Jar Jar Binks!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Mesa, Your Highness?</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Yes. I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>panaka</strong>: The blockade’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: The war’s over…No need for it now.</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: I have one battleship on my scope.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: A droid control ship.</p>
<p><strong>panaka</strong>: They’ve probably spotted us. OBI-WAN ; We
haven’t much time.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Hi! Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Annie! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m with Qui-Gon…but…they’re not going to
let me be a Jedi. I’m too old.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: This is going to be dangerous, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Is it? I can help… Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: To war, I’m afraid. The Queen has had to make
the most difficuld decision of her life. She doesn’t believe in
fighting, Annie. We are a peaceful people…</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I want to help…I’m glad you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city,
Master.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Do you think the Queen’s idea will
work?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and
we cannot use our power to help her.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I’m…I’m sorry for my behavior, Master. It
is not my place to disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you
think I am ready for the trials.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: You have been a good apprentice. You are
much wiser than Iam, Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi
Knight.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Ello! Where das everybody?</p>
<p><strong>four</strong>: PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the
background near the starship.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda
fight, I tink. Sorry, no Gungas…no Gungas.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Do you think they have been taken to
camps?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: More likely they were wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: No…mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in
trouble, go to sacred place. Mackineeks no find them dare.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Do you know where they are?</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Dissen it.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.</p>
<p><strong>capt. tarpals</strong>: Binks!! Noah gain!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: We comen to see da boss.</p>
<p><strong>capt. tarpals</strong>: Ouch time, Binks… Ouch time for all-n
youse.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar, queen amidala, anakin, artoo, qui-gon, obi-wan,
padme, rabe,</strong>: EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through
a clearing full of GUNGAN refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a
grand temple with massive carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other
COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the top of a three-quarter-submerged
head.</p>
<p><strong>boss nass</strong>: Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who’s da
uss-en others??</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo…I come
before you in peace.</p>
<p><strong>boss nass</strong>: Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da
Mackineeks… Dya busten uss-en omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die’n,
mesa tink.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: We wish to form an alliance…</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Your Honor…</p>
<p><strong>boss nass</strong>: Whosa dis?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: I am Queen Amidala This is my decoy…my
protection…my loyal bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: …I am sorry for my deception, but under the
circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do
not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived
in peace…until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have
worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If
we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever…I ask you to help us…no,
I beg you to help us.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: We are your humble servants…our fate is in
your hands.</p>
<p><strong>boss nass</strong>: Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da
Gungans.. Mesa like dis. Maybe wesa bein friends.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: …we’ve sent out patrols. We’ve already located
their starship in the swamp….It won’t be long, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: This is an unexpected move for her.
It’s too aggresive.. Lord Maul, be mindful.</p>
<p><strong>darth maul</strong>: Yes, my Master.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Be patient… Let them make the first
move.</p>
<p><strong>gungan lookout</strong>: Daza comen!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: All right. They’re here!</p>
<p><strong>boss nass</strong>: Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da
Naboo together.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Oh, no, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>boss nass</strong>: So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: General??! Oh, no..</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: and PILOT pile out and join the group.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What is the situation?</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Almost everyone’s in camps. A few
hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement. I brought
as many of the keaders as I could. The Federation Army’s also much
larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a
battle I do not think we can win.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must
draw theDroid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the
secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance,
Captain Pnaka will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace
and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and
confused.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: What do you think, Master Jedi?</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: The Viceroy will be well guarded.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: The difficulty’s getting into the
throne room. Once we’re inside, we shouldn’t have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: There is a possibility with this diversion
many Gungans will be killed.</p>
<p><strong>boss nass</strong>: Wesa ready to do are-sa part.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: We have a plan which should immobilize the
Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid
control ship which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their
rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be
helpless.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: A well-conceived plan. However, there’s
great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields
on the control ship.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: And there’s an even bigger danger. If the
Vicroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid
army.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: That is why we must not fail to get to the
Viceroy. Everything depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: …she is more foolish than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: We are sending all available troops to meet
this army of hers assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of
primitives. We do not expect much resistance.</p>
<p><strong>oom-9</strong>: I am increasing security at all Naboo
detention camps.</p>
<p><strong>darth maul</strong>: I feel there is more to this, My Master.
The two Jedi may be using the Queen for their own purposes.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: The Jedi cannot become involved. They
can only protect the Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that
conenant…. This will work to our advantage…</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: I have your approval to proceed then, My
Lord.</p>
<p><strong>darth sidious</strong>: Proceed. Wipe them put…all of them.

placeto hide and stay there.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: And stay there!</p>
<p><strong>nute</strong>: I thought the battle was going to take place
far from here…this is too close!</p>
<p><strong>rune</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>darth maul</strong>: I told you there was more to this…the
Jedi are involved.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Get to your ships!</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot</strong>: Better find a new hiding place, kid.
I’m taking this ship.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne
room.</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: I agree.</p>

<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where
you are.</p>

always on the right.</p>

<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The Autopilot is searching for what other
ships?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: There is no manual override, Artoo. You’ll
have to rewire it or something.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Look! There they are! That’s where the
autopilot is taking us.</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: We don’t have time for this, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: Let’s try the outside stairway.</p>

<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Whoo, boy! This is tense!</p>
<p><strong>anakn</strong>: : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ve got control?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Okay, let’s go left!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes…I’ve got control. You did it, Artoo!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this
cockpit and that’s what I’m gonna do. Now c’mon!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Oops! Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’ll try spinning, that’s a good trick.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know we’re in trouble! Hang on! The way
out of this mess is the way we got into it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Which one? This one?</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: Bravo flight…go for the central
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>bravo two</strong>: ROger, Bravo Leader.</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: Their deflector shield is too strong.
We’ll never get through it.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I know, Artoo! This isn’t Podracing!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: We’re hit!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m trying to stop! I’m trying to stop!

won’t be long before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue
us.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Master! Master!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: It is too late…It’s…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: Obi-Wan promise…promise me you’ll train the
boy…</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Yes, Master…</p>
<p><strong>qui-gon</strong>: He is the chosen one…he will…bring
balance…train him!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Uh oh. This is not good.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: The systems are still overheated, Artoo.</p>
<p><strong>battle droid captain</strong>: Where’s your pilot?</p>
<p><strong>battle droid captain</strong>: You’re the pilot?</p>
<p><strong>battle droid captain</strong>: Let me see your
identification!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Yes…we have ignition.</p>
<p><strong>battle droid captain</strong>: You! Come out of there or
we’ll blast you!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Not if I can help it! Shields up!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: This should stop them.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: …and take this!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Darn…I missed!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!</p>
<p><strong>tey how</strong>: Sir, we’re losing power… There is some
problem with the main reactor…</p>
<p><strong>dofine</strong>: Impossible!! I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>bravo two</strong>: What’s that?? It’s blowing up from the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: I don’t know, we didn’t hit it.</p>
<p><strong>bravo three</strong>: Look! One of ours! Outta the main
hold!!</p>
<p><strong>jar jar</strong>: Wierdind…</p>
<p><strong>bravo two</strong>: He flew into the hold, behind the
deflector shield and blasted the main reactor…</p>
<p><strong>bravo three</strong>: Amazing… They don’t teach that in the
academy.</p>
<p><strong>ric olie</strong>: We’re all accounted for. Who flew that
ship?</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: I’m not going to get into trouble, am I?</p>
<p><strong>padme</strong>: Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go
back to the Senate and explain all this.</p>
<p><strong>capt. panaka</strong>: I think you can kiss your Trade
franchise goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>amidala</strong>: Congratulations on youer election,
Chancellor. It is so good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>palpatine</strong>: It’s good to be home. Your boldness has
saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated.
Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the
Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I
do not.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in
Qui-Gon.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless,
grave danger I fear in his training.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will
train Anakin. Without the approval of the Council if I must.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Qui-Gon’s defiance I sense in you. Need that,
you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker
will be.</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: He is one with the Force, Anakin…You must
let go.</p>
<p><strong>anakin</strong>: What will happen to me now?</p>
<p><strong>obi-wan</strong>: I am your Master now. You will become a
Jedi, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: There is no doubt. The mysterious
warrior was a Sith.</p>
<p><strong>yoda</strong>: Always two there are….no more…no less. A maste
and an apprentice.</p>
<p><strong>mace windu</strong>: But which one was destroyed, the master
or the apprentice?</p>
