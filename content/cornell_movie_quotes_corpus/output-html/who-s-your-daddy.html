<h1 id="who-s-your-daddy">who-s-your-daddy</h1>
<p><strong>ted nelson</strong>: On any given day, your life can change
in the blink of an eye. It’s a clich�, I know…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …But a lot of clich�s get to be clich�s because
they’re true. Your life CAN change in the blink of an eye. What I mean
is, one day you’re a regular chump, a wannabe something. You’re not even
totally sure WHAT you wannabe…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …The next day the doorbell rings and some
stranger’s holding your ticket to being SOMEBODY.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It happens every day. Dreams come true. And not
just for those dim witted chain-smoking hillbillies you see on TV. You
know, the ones who win the Super Lotto and spend their fortune on a
truck full of Goobers and a new set of front teeth. It could happen to
any guy, any time…even ME.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, that’s not me. I’m over here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re disappointed, I know. I admit, I was
hopeless back then. The ’do, the shades, ugh. But I always had good
taste in women.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s Christy Malone. Head cheerleader, love
of my life, lust of my loins.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: “Health Teacher Flunks Her Own Lesson!” No
WAY! It’s Miss Pratt, smoking a doobie!</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Look at this, Ted! Imagine if we did THIS
in the school paper!</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Hand them over! Immediately!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look at that smile. That wink. That’s no
platonic wink. That’s a wink that says, “I don’t just want you, Ted. I
NEED you.” So of course I had to ask her to the prom. I mean, she was
practically begging for it.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Just the guy I’ve been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ve been looking for you, too.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Wouldn’t it be awesome if we were about to
say the exact same thing?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: From your lips, to God’s ears.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You go first.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well. The prom’s coming up.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: And I was wondering.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: If you don’t have…I mean…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Teddy? Would you please please please take
me to the prom?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of course I will…of
course.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You are the most wonderful guy in the whole
wide world, and I love you madly, Teddy Nelson!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sorry about that. A cheap trick, I know. But
it’s my story and my fantasy. So cut me some slack.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, bro. Spare yourself the
humiliation, the degradation…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You and your pep talks.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t get me wrong. We can salivate over
all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like
melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we’re strictly hamburger guys.
Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope
for.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s Charlie. My best friend. He’s into beef
analogies, partly because he’s a butcher’s son, and partly because,
well, he’s just into beef analogies. What can I say? He’s also a
photographer…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …a very gifted photographer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The senior class voted him, “Most Likely To
Have A Restraining Order Filed Against Him.” But that’s another
story.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a
vibe.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You’ve
been over-tenderizing your meat, again.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: See? Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She smiles at everyone, Ted. She’s like a
newborn with gas.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The only chick more untouchable than
Christy Malone is Miss April. “Hi, my name’s Ginger. I love tofu
burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback. My biggest turn-off is cell
phones during sex.” Here’s a tip: set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don’t be
stingy with the lube. Don’t knock it till you tried it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Were you always this sick?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain’t
lookin THAT good naked.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Someday, I’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You have a better chance of being hit by a
Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all
of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s crazy talk.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I defy any and all limits.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t do it, Ted. Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Any time, any day, a man can completely
reinvent himself.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m warning you. This is an official
warning. Danger, Will Robinson, danger.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: There’s one more person you should meet.
Someone integral to my story.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s Julie Conroy. Unlike the rest of these
losers, she didn’t grow up in Xenia, Ohio. I just met her that day. But
already, she had made a difference in my life.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Oh, Miss Pratt, Miss Pratt! What
were you thinking? How could you be so careless? “Exposing Hypocrisy in
the Morons who Teach Us.” That’s the little bastard’s motto!</p>
<p><strong>miss pratt</strong>: Principal Merkin, I realize we have to
teach the children that recreational drugs are the devil’s work, but
that doesn’t mean we don’t dance with the Prince of Darkness ourselves,
every now and again.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Ah, well, bravo! That’s just what
we’ll tell the school board.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Merk’s punishment was cruel. Expulsion without
appeal. Or working for me on the school paper. The school paper would be
torture for a gonzo reporter like Julie and we both knew it. But what
choice did she have?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop
contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate
Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s just one example. My reporting has made
a difference.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Let me guess: retail sales of little
chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The school dumpsters used to overflow to the
point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos� changed
all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, I loved “Exposed!” and I hate it that you
got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it’s really
not THAT BAD.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Don’t even tell me you’re hot for Miss Titty
Pom Poms over there.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Christy’s a very talented journalist. I see a
Pulitzer in her future.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I didn’t know they gave them for Best Lip
Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Me-ow.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over
with.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I have absolutely no intention–</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: –Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So you see, this is really about a
triple-dog-dare. I don’t even know what it means. I just know, unless
it’s a felony, a triple-dog-dare pretty much has to be met with
immediate action.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, Christy, I was wondering…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Ted, have you lost your mind?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You like me. I like you. I guess it’s pretty
obvious to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I don’t LIKE you. We’re JUST</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But that smile.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I
got my braces off.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So you’ll think about it?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You really don’t get it, do you? I am
genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend
and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It’s, like, a
caveman thing!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So that’s a maybe?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except
maybe in your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: In my dreams. Of course. This is a dream. This
is only a dream.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, Ted. This is an actual emergency.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She’s
got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But you triple-dog-dared me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It was for your own good, in a twisted sort
of publicly humiliating way.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: One word, my friend. One word.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: There’s gotta be more to life than
meatloaf.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: If I never eat another bite of meat loaf again,
it’ll be too soon.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all
that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He’s
what you’d call clinically bummed.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Why can’t we have pot roast or stroganoff or
even a little London broil? I mean, for god’s sake, we own a grocery
store!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We heard about Christy, son.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What is this? Does everybody know everything
I’m about to say or do every freakin’ minute of the day?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: No cursing in this house, young man. Use the
strong vocabulary God gave you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t have a shred of privacy in this whole
stupid town!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We understand your disappointment, Teddy.
Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous… We…uh…we understand
your disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s my private business! Mine!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Can the tantrum, sweet pea. We’re the good
guys, remember?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, Dad. Don’t allow this disturbing
behavior to furrow your collective brow. Ted’s just experiencing some
post-adolescent turmoil, coming to terms with the whole “small town
dynamic.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I hate Xenia! I hate my life!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And until that moment, this was the worst day
of my seventeen and a half years. And then it happened. Three, two,
one…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Whoa! Sorry, mister.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: In a hurry, are we?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It
wouldn’t really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door…What are you
selling?</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: Bad news.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: People pay good money for that?</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: I’m just a messenger.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh no. No way. I’ve had all the bad news I can
take for one day.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: It’s about your parents.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My parents? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: I’m terrible at this. I blurt. I’m a
blurter. Your parents…They …well…they exist no further. Skinny-dipping.
The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn’t pretty.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’ve got the wrong guy. The closest my
parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: Well kid, I’m speaking of…your biological
parents.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: The will reading is next Tuesday.
Naturally all of Ted’s expenses will be taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on
Tuesday morning.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We own a small family grocery store.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: How quaint.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s spring break. I don’t want to go to a will
reading.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s part of growing up, honey.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What? Having spring break ruined by will
readings?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You know what your mother means.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: All right, I can give you two tickets,
prepaid, but you must be there. There’s no other way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, Dad. Allow me to accompany Ted. I can
assure you, I’ll be the level-headed sidekick to your angst ridden
teen.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I think Ted should take someone older, more
responsible.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What about Charlie? You boys could make it a
little adventure.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to
deserve this?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I remember spring break of my senior year.
Seems like a lifetime ago.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Dad, please.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from
the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Remember how you struggled through that whole
facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You’re way ahead of me again?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa
almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog
festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn’t have to
slaughter your sow.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: The lesson being?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sometimes you have to do stuff you don’t want
to do. It’s all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in
the end.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m getting so good at this.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You guys are my parents.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Of course we are.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: They didn’t want me when I was born. Why should
I care…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Son.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, why should I?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: They had a rough life. Your father was a
bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place
for a baby.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: They did do one great thing. They gave us our
boy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los
Angeles be?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I guess we could go to Disneyland or
something.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Think of it as a rite of passage to
manhood.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Like one of those “National Geographic”
specials with the topless chicks?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Whatever helps you cope.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I guess it’s better than having tribal patterns
carved in my face.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: There ya go. Always remember, focus on the
peach…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …not the pit.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Always one step ahead of your dear old dad.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I wonder if this is what it feels like to
be born?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Think about it…Long tunnel, bright lights,
it’s full of vaginal symbolism.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Poor Freud, turning in his grave.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Seriously, it’s like we’re being reborn. We
really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows
about your massive humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Nobody knows about your mental retardation.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nobody knows you barfed during junior high
school graduation.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Nobody knows about your constant
masturbation.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And nobody knows you’re a virgin! Aw, who
are we kidding…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I think I’ll reinvent a new best friend.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What are the odds of there being ANOTHER
Ted Nelson on our flight?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Astronomical.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hi, I’m Ted Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: I’m so terribly sorry for your loss. Your
father was a great man.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who the hell was your father?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, Dad said…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …A bouncer? Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Maybe he got promoted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t. Touch. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is the life, baby. We get ourselves
some tail and we’re talking SPRING BREAK!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Cut it out, before you break something!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: For a guy about to try his first Dom
Perignon, you are extremely uptight.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: We can’t afford that!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t you know anything about limo
etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger
guys.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And like every hamburger guy knows, when
you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of
it until they figure out you don’t belong there and kick your sorry ass
out.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Nice. Is that in the limo etiquette handbook,
too?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is how the other half lives, bro.
Enjoy it while you can.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful mourner #1</strong>: Welcome, Mr. Nelson. You are
so very very welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful mourner #2</strong>: We feel your pain, so
deeply.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Something tells me we’re not in Xenia
anymore, Toto.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m Charles. The handsome, devoted best
friend. We’re so close, we feel each other’s pain.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: See what you do to me, baby.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh my, he would have been so proud. You’re
the spitting image of him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He never spits, ma’am. Ever. He can’t even
get a good hocker going. I’ve tried to teach him. It comes from the
diaphragm.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re on the next plane home.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m Helen McDole. Your father’s executive
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: We’re running out of time. The kid’s here.
We don’t need HIM.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Perhaps we could be patient for just a moment
or two longer?</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: What did the doctor say to the nurse as
they watched something black and white and red in a blender? No more
patients.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: Are you familiar with “Heaven?”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m seventeen. I know it like the back of my
hand.</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: Your fathered owned the entire “Heaven”
empire. You own it now. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Everything? The publishing division, the
real estate holdings, the retail outlets, the theme parks?</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: As far as the eye can see.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right
there to hug the living daylights out of you!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: But if you’re watching this, then it means we
bit the dust.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: But don’t worry…we’ll be in heaven. The
REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a
state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: If you’re anything like yours truly, then you
probably figure we didn’t want you when you were born, so who cares if
we’re dead? Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: But we did want you. It’s just that you
don’t always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom
and dad.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in
the garage would turn into all this.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Can you believe that was me?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Before we knew it, we created the most popular
men’s magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: So here we are. Dead. But we never want you
to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We love you, Ted. We always did. We always
will.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I can’t believe that’s your mother. We’re
talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501’s.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Perv.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I’m so terribly sorry. Am I too
late?</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: Ah, Mr. Deeds. You’re just in time to
congratulate your nephew. He inherited the empire.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Every morsel of it?</p>
<p><strong>zukerman</strong>: It would appear so.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Smashing! Welcome to the family, Ted.
You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to
set the world on fire! You are going to…call me Uncle Billy? Please?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I have only one concern…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You do like girls, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Of course I like girls.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: A lot? I mean, a whole lot?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: As much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He likes them with the unbridled enthusiasm
of a seventeen-year-old virgin who’s been making mental beef jerky since
he saw the bevy of tender young skirt steaks at his new hacienda.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: That’s my boy!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: The parties are held in here when the
weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Seldom? No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You said parties but you meant ORGIES,
right? Stick with me. I know their codes.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: The orgies, exactly. Take a deep
breath. You can smell it. Pure sexuality, oozing from the walls.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No
wonder it’s called “Heaven.”</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: This is a fun place…but we don’t
usually come here until after the orgies.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy
salon?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Indeed it is. During the day, visitors
prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Hello, girls! Have you met Ted?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is like my every wet dream come true.
I don’t even care that you’re here, too, bro.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Be cool. Fake it if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Good advice, Ted. You have your
father’s instincts.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Just remember, you’re not the man you
were a day ago. And these girls, let’s just say they’d be eager to
please you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I wonder how many of them will be at the
orgy tonight?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: This isn’t some 80’s porno film, you dip shit.
There are no wild sex orgies.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Not ever. Never.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Never say never.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, god. Look. Look.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I really love your peaches, wanna shake
your tree.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should
be a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I…uh…I think she’s doing fine on her own.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me like you
mean it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You kiss your mother with that mouth?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’d kiss your mother with this mouth. I
mean, if she wasn’t, you know…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So far away? In Xenia?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Teddy? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How are you, baby? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m all right, Mom. I’m not in Siberia, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking
good care of you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, I’m doing fine. I have so much to tell
you. I don’t even know where to begin.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Save it, honey. We want to hear every detail
when you get back, but we don’t want you to run up Mr. Zukerman’s phone
bill.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s okay, Mom. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Ted, it’s your dad. I have a question for you.
I don’t know how to put it tactfully. You know I’m lousy with words.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Just say it, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I know they were simple people, but did this
trip help your college fund at all?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Dad, let’s just say I can buy anything I want
in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Well, good. Every little bit helps.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Check this out. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I better go, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We’ll see you soon. Have fun in… …the land of
fruits and nuts.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What is it now?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Check it out!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t tell me. Another vision of incomparable
beauty?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Beauty? No. We’re talking GODDESS.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I get it now. You and me. We’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big
fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to
identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then there must be a whole room, made
completely of chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And some really fast cars.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t be such a pansy. All of this is
YOURS.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s a lot to digest. Imagine how you’d
feel.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’d feel like staying up all night!
Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I feel like I’m entering a forbidden tomb…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …where they get all the really good porno
channels on cable.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Cha-ching. Jackpot.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, how inappropriate is that!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Take a whiff of heaven.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: How would you like it if I did that to your
mother’s panties?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’d call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this
is different. She wasn’t your mother mother–</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Give me those!</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I do apologize, sir. I heard a noise.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: We were just–</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: –I completely understand, sir. I’ll leave
you to your business. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A couple of boys fighting over a pair of
red silk panties is nothing compared to what he’s seen.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, he’s probably been serving cocktails, SO
TO SPEAK, at the orgies.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Wanna take me for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I-I don’t have the keys.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: They’re in the ignition, silly.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You do know how to drive?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t have much experience with
a…uh…stick.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Want a lesson?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Press your left foot on the clutch. And turn
the key.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Now release the brake. And slide the stick
into first gear.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Now very carefully apply some pressure to
the gas pedal with your right foot as you release the clutch with your
left.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: The first time can be awkward. You just have
to get on and try again.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t even know if I should be doing this.
It’s a very expensive car.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It’s your car. These are all your cars.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Some of them have to be automatics.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Your father liked shifting. He said it
brought him closer to the engine. “Like a woman, purring with
ecstasy.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say
that.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I know. I’m Ginger. Miss April.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The one with the horses.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I almost didn’t recognize you without…you
know…that stallion between…your…uh…legs.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That sounded so much better in my head.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Don’t worry. He found the chocolate
room.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hi ho, Silver.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Your father always said, “Money matters only
to the man who doesn’t have it.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sorry, habit.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Who exactly ARE you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What do you mean? I’m Ted Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: And who IS Ted Nelson?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Is he a small town boy, destined to live an
ordinary life with an ordinary wife and a tiny house with a boring old
white picket fence?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Or do you have a taste for the good life,
Ted? It’s in your blood.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I always knew there was more. I felt it.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Then remember, you are the heir to a billion
dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply
everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can’t even wrap
your head around everything that is yours. ALL</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll take the whole case.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Every one of these women thinks she
should be the next Angel of the Month. It’s your job, Ted, to decide
which of them is right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let me get this straight…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: If it isn’t straight by now, son, you
probably should see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: These are real, live women?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: We don’t generally feature blow-up
dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there’s a market for
it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: God, I love being dead.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I like her.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Nice choice. There’s only one problem.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You think she upgraded?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They went in through the belly button.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: We don’t allow TIPN, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Tipping?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: TIPN. Tattoos, implants, piercings, nose
jobs. Our angels must be pure, unadultered, completely natural.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You have your father’s eye.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all
right?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah. Everything’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You ready for your big coming out
party? Everybody’s dying to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents
always said you never get a second chance to make a good first
impression.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: They said that? Really? Oh, your
parents. The Nelson’s. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Truth is, I’m a little nervous.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you
be nervous?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All those people out there. It’s a lot of
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Huh! You laugh in the face of
pressure!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You are a multi-media magnate. The
Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.</p>
<p>****: You are the Emperor of every little girl who dreamed of growing
up to see her naughty bits spread eagle, airbrushed to glossy
perfection, with staples through her ass.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You’re the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch
of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of
Coitus.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Me? The King of Coitus?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Whoa. But…that’s the thing… I’ve never even
actually…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Why, look who’s here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The Potentate of Poon has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ain’t life amazing? A week ago, you
couldn’t get to second base! Now you OWN second base!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I told you you could do it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I was like a different person tonight.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You were the new and improved you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I would have been laughed right out of
Xenia.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: No one will be laughing at you now,
Ted. You can take that to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s really going to be strange going home in a
couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You ARE home. But go ahead, finish
school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I’ll be your
point person here on the magazine.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Really? You’d do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I’ve been very lazy for a long, long
time.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You seem like you’re anything but lazy, Uncle
Billy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I never finished school myself. Never
had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife’s perky
tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver
platter. I never struggled for a second.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My parents always say hard work builds
character.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: It’s not like I didn’t have ideas, I
had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father.
Never had the guts.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What kind of ideas?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Well…for one thing…I think it’s
despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western
notion of “classic beauty.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You think we should be more open minded?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: The world is a big, beautiful place. We
can open new markets in Africa and Asia. Imagine the Dali Lhama reading
our magazine.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: In other words, our scope is too narrow.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: At our press conference tomorrow, I
think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few
leggy 36D’s, with blond hair upstairs and down.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Want some company?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Who’s your daddy?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: …My brilliant, extraordinary nephew,
Ted Nelson, has brought enough fresh blood to this company to make all
of Transylvania happy for the next fifty or sixty years. I’ll give him
the mike now and you’ll see what I mean. This apple didn’t fall far from
the tree.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Don’t forget to tell them all your
qualifications.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that
part. For two years I’ve been the editor of the high school paper in
Xenia, Ohio. I’ve won some awards, made a difference. I’ve always had
journalism in my soul. Now I know why.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: They tell me I’ve got my father’s taste in
women and cars. The faster, the better.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And I’m really looking forward to the challenge
of bringing “Heaven” magazine into the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: He asked me to the prom! ME! We’re
practically engaged!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He reinvented himself into a dick.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: You don’t even have your high
school diploma yet, Mr. Nelson. I’m still the boss of you.</p>
<p><strong>babbling reporter</strong>: The big question now remains:
Will success spoil Ted Nelson, the straight-A journalism student from
Xenia, Ohio, whose life was transformed overnight when he found out he
was rich, powerful, and certainly the most eligible bachelor in the
entire nation?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Our Teddy inherited “Heaven?”</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: He said he was set for book money.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, Dad. Forget about roller blades for my
birthday. I’d prefer a DNA test. Can you prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt that I am not, for example, a Guccione?</p>
<p><strong>entry way</strong>: Dad opens the front door to reveal a
delivery man, holding a flashy new bike.</p>
<p><strong>deliveryman</strong>: Delivery for Jimmy Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: My goodness, who sent this?</p>
<p><strong>delivery man</strong>: It’s from “Heaven,” ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Ted. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I love you, Ted!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We can’t accept it. It’s much too expensive.
Right, dear?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted
but…</p>
<p><strong>delivery man #2</strong>: Delivery for Robert Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: For me? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>delivery man #2</strong>: Appears to be tools, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, no. Ted’s gone completely overboard.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Sweetheart, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me
the limited edition Buckeye colors.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, honey. We can’t accept this
extravagance.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Teddy? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well? Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What is all this? When are you coming home?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Just a few tokens of my affection. I’ll be back
soon, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too
expensive.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the
factories they came from.</p>
<p><strong>delivery man #3</strong>: Where do you want them, lady?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Only the best for my mother.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You promise you’ll finish school?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll make you very proud.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: You cannot land a helicopter in my
school yard! Get that blasted thing out of here!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What gives, Don Corleone?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We reinvented ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: New Hushpuppies don’t make a new man.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’ve obviously never had your dogs
nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That explains the emptiness that haunts
me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jealousy is so unattractive.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Second only to unfettered arrogance and the
inability to see the irony therein.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wanna see my hickey from Miss December?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: I like you, Ted. You know that. I
liked you before you were filthy rich.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thanks, Principal Merkin.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: I’ll be blunt. I know you can take
it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes, sir. I’ll brace myself.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Ted, you are the best editor this
school paper ever had. You don’t need to be pandering flesh. It’s
nonsense. It’s beneath you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You think I ought to just tell them thanks but
no thanks? I don’t want your silly billion dollar empire?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: That’s a good start, yes. A very
good start.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream.
It’s every red-blooded, heterosexual male’s dream.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: I never figured you for a
pimp.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Have you ever even looked at “Heaven?”</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: What kind of sick question is
that? I’ll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing
here. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I guess you won’t be wanting that Rolex I sent
you, then?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: No. No, I won’t. Thank you. For
reminding me.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Great jacket, Teddy Bear.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah? You like?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Makes your shoulders look so big and
broad.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: A few billion bucks and suddenly he’s
Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s so nice to have FRIENDS like you,
Christy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need
scratching?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Your article sucked.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: In what sense?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: In the sense that there is no “hidden agenda”
behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn’t even
know it was there.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on, Julie. Don’t screw up. You have some
real talent.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Just because someone died and made you king
of the publishing world doesn’t mean you’re even one ounce smarter than
you were a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m still better than you. Nothing changed
except the decimal point in your savings account.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s not ENTIRELY true.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, right. You’re probably not a virgin
anymore. But as far as being a hack, that much is status quo.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What do you want from me? I’m trying to be
fair. But I can’t keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into
an Agent Orange cover up.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then I’ll write about YOU.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: “Local boy inherits more money than god.”
Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Really? You wanna write about me?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Goodness…it’s delicious. I’ve never tasted
anything so tender.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Beats the heck out of meatloaf. Although your
meatloaf is second to none, love muffin.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, Dad. My trembling taste buds have just
been assailed by the bittersweet knowledge of all they’ve been missing
these past nine years.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No offense, Wolfgang Puck, but dead flesh is
dead flesh. This just happens to be better than most dead flesh on the
planet.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Absolutely…heavenly.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Why, thank you, sir. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ted has bettered our lives to the point where
I can no longer see myself as “the old Jimmy” I was but a day or two
past. You may all call me James. From this moment forward.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Finally, some gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We’re grateful, Ted. It’s not that. Those
Craftsman tools…they’re a dream come true.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Your Dad and I were raised with a certain work
ethic, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We can’t start living like we’re the
Rockerfellers or something.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, Dad. The Rockerfellers are paupers
compared to my favorite brother, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You don’t have to work another day in your
lives.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: But how would we pay our bills?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We just barely have enough for your college
tuition, son.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t you get it? In one day I earn more
interest than the store’s entire annual revenue.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh. Goodness.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re free. You can do anything you ever
wanted to do!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go
deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now’s your chance.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: But those are our dreams, son. We have to make
them come true.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Consider me your fairy godfather, except
without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever,
for the rest of your lives.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: But who would run the store?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Forget the store. Think big.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday.
Something real and honest.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We love our lives just the way they are.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Call me Charlie. I’m a photographer for
“Heaven” magazine. And a very cunning linguist.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I have to admit, I always felt… different.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Different how? Different like a dwarf at a
basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t get the distinction.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Could everybody else tell you were different,
or were you the only one who knew?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I
was suffocating.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I see. So more like a tight rope walker who
secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Warm peanuts?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No thanks. I prefer my penis at room
temperature.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: She said peanuts, you cretin.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You never know around here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t write that part.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Is this an gritty expos� or a candy ass press
release?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Write what you want. Just try not to make it so
obvious that you’re crazy about me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Funny you should say “peachy.”</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I did my homework. Your grandfather was a
peach farmer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my
biological grandfather did.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some
sort.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Considering this is your first time on a
private jet, on which you are interviewing the world’s most eligible
bachelor, you are extremely cavalier.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on
Planet Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: See? You’re impertinent, rude, sarcastic.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: And this is not my first time on a private
jet, so quit acting like I’m Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: A little respect would be nice, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Money can’t buy respect, Ted. Saying what you
mean. Meaning what you say. Being an honorable person. That’s how you
earn respect.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Great jacket, Teddy. It makes your shoulders
look so big and broad.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You do look smashing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Positively dashing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sharp as a mashed potato sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh wow, look…they’ve even got baby
gherkins!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I have an idea! I’ll be right back!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well? What do you think of her?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re so twitterpated you don’t even see the
miner’s hat and the pickax.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re implying she’s, what, a gold digger?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Charlie’s right. Jealousy is so
unattractive.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Second only to unbridled, narcissistic
conceit.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Why can’t you be nice to me?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’ve got enough people kissing your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Here you go, cutie patootie. Rich guys
always wear flowers.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: How are the hometown folks treating you, back
in Xenia?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, Jay. They’ve been exceptionally
supportive.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking
you to sponsor the local quilting bee?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m no stranger to the notion of philanthropy.
Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What about the future? You planning to rock the
boat at all? Stir things up in “Heaven?”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are
planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western
notions of “beauty.”</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I see, so you’d be open to little ladies from
Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Matter of fact, Jay, I’m planning a pictorial
focusing on the women of my hometown, “The Girls of Xenia.” Just to show
my appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The Girls of Xenia? Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now you’re talking. What did Andrew Carnegie
ever do? Open a couple of libraries? BOR-ING.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Poochie? Where’s my poochie? Where
is she?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Is my Poochie in here?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Is she in here? No. Where on earth
could she be?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: There’s my Poochie! There’s my
girl!</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Poochie loves Daddy, doesn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. merkin</strong>: Breakfast is getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Thank you, dear.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. merkin</strong>: No dogs at the table.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: I know, dear.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Thatta girl.</p>
<p><strong>radio spot</strong>: How many times have people told you,
“Jeepers, you look swell naked!” Well now’s your chance to go straight
to “Heaven!”</p>
<p><strong>radio spot</strong>: Come on down for “The Girls of Xenia”
pictorial. Let’s show the nation our cows aren’t the only ones with
great udders.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: This, my friends, this is not
“Heaven.” This flesh rag is a one way ticket to hell! We must voice our
outrage! To remain passive in the eye of the devil is like inviting him
to a pot luck in your own backyard and asking him to bring the
three-bean salad!</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: For the sake of this community,
and its impressionable young minds, I propose this publication be banned
from our city!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Thank you for that long-winded but
impassioned speech, Mr. Merkin. I hope you can cut to the chase,
Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: With all due respect to Merk, he doesn’t have
to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others. Ever hear of
the First Amendment?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: We cannot afford free speech if it
excises the moral fiber of this community!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: If that were true, this would be one seriously
constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in
“Heaven” since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it
under the mattress.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Isn’t it true, Principal Merkin, that you
only care now because “Heaven” is suddenly too close to home?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Indeed it is, Miss Conroy! I make
no bones about it! “Heaven” has gone too far!</p>
<p><strong>mr. needleman</strong>: Principal Merkin is right! We can’t
let “Heaven” violate our own daughters, wives, sisters, mothers,
girlfriends, aunts…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I wouldn’t want to name names, Mr. Needleman,
or cause any undue embarrassment. But many members of this community
have been loyal “Heaven” readers for the better part of the last two
decades. Not to mention certain charter subscribers who have developed a
voracious appetite for our video library as well. I don’t suppose,
“Courtney Leaves The Convent” rings a bell to anyone?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Mr. Nelson, you are Beelzebub’s
henchman! You are single-handedly destroying the integrity of our
community, and I will not have it! I’ll gather signatures. I’ll petition
the courts.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You do what you have to do, Dick. But if
there’s a man among us who doesn’t like to steal a look at some pretty
titty once in a while, let him cast the first stone.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re like a centerfold waiting to happen.
And let me assure you, I have some serious pull with the publisher.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m an adult. I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: My roof, my rules, young lady.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Send us a picture, sugar. We’ll get back to
you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hello there…Looking great…Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re late, bro!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know,
enthusiastic.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’ll never believe who’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It better not be my Aunt Trudy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting…</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hi, Teddy Bear.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Christy? You want to be in “Heaven?”</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I turned eighteen over spring break. I’m
eligible.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I feel like I’ve just been hit by a Mack
truck.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: With a refrigerated cargo bed full of
sirloin tip.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: So far, so good. Some of them have real
Angel potential.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Really? So I’m doing OK?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We’re impressed but not surprised, Ted. You
have your father’s impeccable judgment.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My father must’ve been amazing.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: He was in a league of his own.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Sorry I–</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s okay. You need me?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Your mom said you’ve been ignoring your
chores.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No problem, consider it done. I had this idea
of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia
landmarks. You think that would be a problem?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We’ll send you the release forms, Ted. Our
staffers will help in any way they can.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You’re the Titan of Tushies, the
General of Jism. Don’t you forget it, Ted-baby.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You have to understand. This was a big shock,
for all of us. One minute you’re our little boy, of whom we could not be
more proud. The next minute you’re the owner of this whole pornographic
empire.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: But that doesn’t make you the boss of
everything, son.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Don’t you see how your self involvement and
lack of humility are affecting the whole family?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that
Winnebago you always wanted! Now you’re ashamed of me?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You ordered a Winnebago?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We’re not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don’t
approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called “flesh parties”
you attend. But we can get past all that.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We miss you. We miss our son.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We miss our family.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I promised I’d finish high school and that’s
what I’m doing. What more do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We think you should give up the magazine. Sell
it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We want you to go to college, find a career you
love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever
after.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so
far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Watch your tone, mister.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Why don’t you just admit what this is really
all about? I’m not your real kid and you can’t control me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No wonder I was so bored. No wonder I hated
this one-horse cow town. I come from talented people who took chances
and dared to imagine a life without limits! I was never meant to be
raised by…GROCERS.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Teddy? I was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: After graduation…maybe we could go away
together?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I bet St. Tropez in July would be paradise.
For a honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You could have warned us.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oops, sorry. Warning: You’ve got lipstick on
your teeth.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wow…you clean up nice.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Put your eyeballs back in your head, William
Randolph. I’m on assignment. A girl has to fit in.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Teddy, I thought we were having a moment
here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Of course we were.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: I apologize for interrupting the
festivities, but I have some good news. I’ve been reviewing the rules
and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools. And it seems
quite clear… “Minors may not be accompanied to school functions by
adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians.”</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: So long, ladies. Prom’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Honestly, Merk. It’s like you were never
seventeen and the head of a media empire.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Rules are rules.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on, it’s our only senior prom.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to
a higher power.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Here’s the deal, Merk. Forget the “rules
and regulations” malarkey and we’ll give you seven minutes in heaven
with the Taylor Triplets.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Out! Now!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What’s your price, Merk? How much will it cost
to make you go bye bye?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: You’re crossing the line,
Mr. Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to
Principal Dick Merkin?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A
presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: That’s it! You’re out of here!</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Good-bye, Mr. Nelson. Have a
pleasant evening.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Ted! Do something!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This is humiliating. We’re being ejected
from a prom!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hang in there, I’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I guess…I don’t know…I guess we should leave if
we’re not wanted.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I hear you, bro. We’re Angus men in a
ground round town.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This is what I get for playing den mother in
“Romper Room.” Take me to the airport, Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why don’t you just hitch a ride on the
horse you rode in on?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t forget your broom!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I thought I loved her.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Chicks are like buses. If you miss one,
don’t sweat it. There’s another coming ’round the corner.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Take your pick. They’re IDENTICAL.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Everybody, listen up! This prom sucks! Let’s
party at my place!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, leave one. Somebody’s grandmother might
want one.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And while you’re at it, I’ll take ten dozen of
those puppies with the springy heads.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I love those springy head puppies!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don’t rain
on our parade.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me.
First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our
hair on prom night?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Our state has a zero tolerance
policy for underage drinking.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You called the cops on us?</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Alcohol does horrible things to a
developing young mind.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: To the best hiding place in the world.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I can’t believe your dad built this for
you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He didn’t. He had it built.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Not “whatever.” It’s two different
things.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He cared enough to want you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He phoned it in.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian,
down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You’re a poor little rich
girl.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet
Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You think my dad would have been like that if I
knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of
teaching me how to play ball?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Your dad taught you everything.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I mean my father.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes
a real man to be a dad.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s all so complicated.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s incredibly simple.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I feel like I’m being drawn and quartered. Like
every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different
direction.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Eventually you’ll let go.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then you’ll see who’s really holding on to
you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re amazing.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Even when you infuriate me, I still want to
kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But you never do.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: If we were a team, we could do anything. I
mean, anything.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your
audience is way ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s two words. And I’m out of the
“exposed” business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk’s a boy
scout.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: There’s gotta be something. We have to dig
deeper.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as
him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He shut down your paper! You’re stuck writing
articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: A good journalist can take lemons and make
lemonade. I’m honing my craft.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Then you won’t mind covering that watermelon
seed spitting contest next week…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: See what I mean. He’s squeaky clean. He makes
Gandhi look like a war monger.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I have a great idea. Let’s lose the last
button.</p>
<p><strong>feminist</strong>: The city tower belongs to the city, not to
some pornographer.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: The library also belongs to the city. And
guess what? It’s going to have a new Ted Nelson wing with three thousand
children’s books.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: You should be ashamed, young lady!
Your body is a sacred temple!</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Young lady, I will pray for god’s
mercy upon your soul.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Don’t bother, Merk! I’m already going to
“Heaven!”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Get them together.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Brilliant! Molly, give me all you’ve got.
For Merk.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Stop that, stop that this
instant!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I never saw anybody turn so many shades of
red.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I can’t wait to see the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It was incredible. The light, the crowd,
everything.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately
how proud I am of you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Seriously? I’m doing all right?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You’re taking this bull of an empire by
the horns, but you’re still keeping your small town values. You’re not
letting all this “stuff” spoil you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I owe it all to you. Without your help I’d be
lost.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I wish I knew you years ago, when my
brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say…you
can’t change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your
Christmas presents.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Why don’t you come to town this
weekend? We could play some golf, chase some skirts.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’d love to, but I really need to crack the
books. Final exams are coming up and I’ve been slacking.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You’re right. I should work, too. Our
first issue together is almost ready to print.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: You’re a great kid. Don’t you forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: James, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen
said James sounds too pretentious.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what
does she know?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She knew exactly where you were staying,
which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s really late…do your parents know where you
are?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Mom and Dad think I’m tucked safely in bed
and that’s all they need to know. Will this discussion be continuing in
the hallway, or somewhere slightly more inviting?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Impressive. This is bigger than our whole
house.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Most places are, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They say money can’t buy happiness but this
is a reasonably good facsimile.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So, what brings you here at his hour?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: My new bike.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I came to ask permission to take custody of
your room.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My room?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It’s
a no-brainer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s not up to me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom and Dad said it’s yours. They seem to
think you’re coming home.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You can have it, then. I’m not going back
there.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If you could just sign right there.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You want it in writing?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just a formality.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s it? I mean, you don’t want to order room
service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I’m
gone and I’ll be doing hard time.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Are they okay?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Aside from the fact that Mom’s eyes are
nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the
car trying to fix stuff that isn’t broken, things couldn’t be
better.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I miss them, too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You can’t come back. That is, you can, but
your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re a peach.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was
a peach farmer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He was my Grandfather, too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I meant biologically.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s a crappy thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Look Ted. I’m cool with everything. You’ve
long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You’ve always had
an itch for the good life. I’m happy for you. This couldn’t happen to a
nicer guy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass
schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the
Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson’s FAMILY Market
so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their
kids.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I didn’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You ever look down on them again and call
them “grocers” like it’s a dirty word, and you’ll be sucking your filet
mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s probably my office.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well? Where the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He’s on the move?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I got an anonymous tip and an address in
Cincinnati.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know. This place seems pretty tame.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You expected whips, chains, Merk being
cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: At least it’s not another 4-H meeting or a Big
Brother barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Amen to that.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look at us. It’s one o’clock in the morning, on
a school night. We’re in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our
principal with some big city tart.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m trembling with excitement.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That has more to do with your proximity to
me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my
flesh.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many
people know that.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I figured you for more of a hairy armpit
guy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are
my thing.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wearing them? Or humping them?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing
nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s refreshingly deviant.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m very aural.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can
turn me on, or off, like a switch.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read
the phone book and melt me.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very
“Cosmo.”</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You live and learn. I realized the most
important thing to me, above all, is trust.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that
one coming.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You lose trust in someone and it’s over,
done, gone, forever.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Do you trust me, Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Not a chance.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Trust is something you earn, over time. You
don’t just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I want you to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Maybe someday.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Julie, I’ll tell you something that is the
god’s honest truth. I’ve seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a
lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But absolutely true.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: …“A feeling deep in your soul/Says you were
half, now you’re whole…”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: We just found the ULTIMATE centerfold for “The
Girls of Xenia!”</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really
despise “The Girls of Xenia.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I know, their small town mentality can be
maddening.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I mean your pictorial. It bothers me,
profoundly.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Aw Julie, it’s my job. It’s like being a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re telling me you don’t get aroused by a
roomful of naked breasts.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’ve seen one naked breast, you’ve seem them
all.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Which explains the continued success of
“Heaven” for how many decades?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re quick. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You think you’re working with chimps
here?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I’d
do it and I have to keep my word.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Keeping your word is something I can actually
respect, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I thought I’d be nervous, but you sure know
how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I do? I mean, yeah, I do.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I have to admit, I am so totally turned on.
We should do it. Now.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Do it?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You know…take the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I remember the first time you walked into
Mrs. Temple’s class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond
ponytail.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Which you pulled, hard!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That was code for “I like you.”</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Wanna unzip me?</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Remember dress up day? You and Charlie
lifting skirts during recess.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual
harassment was without consequence.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Things change. Now I’m taking off my
clothes…all by myself.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You have changed since second grade.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I mean, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You expect me to think at a time like this?
There isn’t a drop of blood in my brain.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Oh, Teddy Bear, you’re funny.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: God help me.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I heard they do this on photo shoots. Wanna
to do the other one?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re doing just fine, Christy. Believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>chrity</strong>: Then I’m ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: I was always too shy to admit how much I
liked you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on, I was hamburger. You were
porterhouse.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep
down, I’ve always been dripping with special sauces. Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: God, you are so hot.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Then you better get in the water, before
you get burned.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: You and me, finally. This will be so
fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m sorry, Christy. I’ve been crazy about you
forever, and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot, but I
just can’t go through with it.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Sure you can. You’re only human. It’s not
like you’re made of steel. Or ARE you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s up, doc?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wait, Julie, wait!</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Ted. She pushed right past
me.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: At least let me explain!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Go away, Ted. Just go.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Please believe me. It was just a kiss for old
time’s sake. I’ve had a stupid crush on her since I was seven, but I
never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in
front of me, completely naked.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Being naked is no big deal. It has nothing to
do with emotion, nothing to do with love. You can be around all the
naked girls you want and you won’t be even one step closer to anything
meaningful in your life.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: See that? You don’t know me even one ounce
better than you did before. You and your stupid magazine. I liked you
better when you were sweet and kind and human, like the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: We’ve got a huge problem with the
magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>jock #1</strong>: You got a great sense of humor. I love the
three hundred pound Eskimo chick.</p>
<p><strong>jock #2</strong>: You like Eskimo pie, Teddy?</p>
<p><strong>jock #3</strong>: I like the African chick with the big lip.
You could stash a lot of weed in there. Maybe even a six pack.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: We wanted to challenge the notions of classic
beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in
the centerfold.</p>
<p><strong>principal merkin</strong>: Ted, I realize I owe you an
apology. You’re destroying “Heaven” much faster from the inside than I
ever could from the outside. Good job, son.</p>
<p><strong>head of marketing</strong>: Our advertisers are wigging out.
Half of them are threatening to pull their ads for next month. The other
half already did.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: It was nothing more than beginner’s
folly. Tell everyone to lighten up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s a little more serious than that, Bill.
The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that
this will never happen again. Some of them are even calling for Ted’s
resignation.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you’ll
see. Next month we’ll be back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>head of finance</strong>: Another disaster like this could
sink us. We’ve got thousands of subscribers requesting refunds.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: The kid came up with something that
sounded good on paper. Who knew our readers wouldn’t dig it?</p>
<p><strong>head of marketing</strong>: We tried to warn you.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Sometimes young people need to make
their own mistakes. That’s how they learn.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It won’t happen again. It will never happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I always thought I wanted fame and fortune and
beautiful women. But sometimes your dreams come true, and they cause you
nothing but grief. I just want to chuck everything and sell the stupid
magazine. It’s not worth the pain.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come, let me show you something.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your parents never wanted to interfere with
your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They
knew they did the right thing. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t watch
you and miss you, from afar.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You mean they knew who I was?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They kept this scrapbook of your life. It
meant the world to them.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I wondered about them, for so many years. I
wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they
gave me up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Giving you up was the most unselfish thing
they ever did. When they founded “Heaven,” they wished they could take
you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire,
knowing that someday it would all be yours.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My legacy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your parents would be crushed to think you
weren’t happy with it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: They’re not my parents, Helen. My parents are
back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And the girl I love, she hates “Heaven.” If I
keep it, she’ll never respect me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But how can you respect yourself if you
don’t?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever
forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You were always our number one son.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, Dad. This display of unconditional love
is appalling.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We are a FAMILY.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: A family, need I remind you, that HE
ridiculed and left for dead.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I will not have my boys arguing.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So, when I’m seventeen, can I turn everyone’s
life upside-down, behave like a total piece of canine excrement, and
then wipe the slate clean with a half-baked apology and a Kodak
moment?</p>
<p><strong>mom &amp; dad</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Which is precisely why I got the rights to my
new room IN WRITING.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I need your help. I’m really in deep shit.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Don’t say “shit,” honey. Use the strong
vocabulary God gave you.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Besides, there’s no problem too deep or too
shitty for us to solve.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Son, it’s a simple fix. The only difference
between my store and that magazine of yours is a bunch of zeros. Now,
have I ever told you the story about the can of peaches?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Ladies, gentlemen. “Heaven” has gone to
hell.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I loved my brother. I stood by his
wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that
he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world
quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I
guided him as best I could. But he’s only seventeen, with a mind of his
own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block.
There is only one clear solution… And I think we all know what that
is–</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My job. Back off, Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The only man I called “Dad” owns a little
grocery store in Xenia, Ohio. He learned a lot of cool stuff from my
Grandpa, who was a peach farmer in his day. Grandpa knew the right thing
to say in every situation, and it usually involved peaches. My dad’s a
lot like him. And he taught me, you have to focus on the peachy side of
life, not the pits.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: There was a time when canned peaches were the
hottest, greatest thing ever invented. It was like a little taste of
summer, anytime you wanted. Grocery stores couldn’t keep them in stock,
they were so popular. And even though other canned fruits like pears,
plums, and pineapples have come along, people still need to know they
can get their canned peaches, on the same shelf, whenever they want
them. It’s comforting, you know? It fulfills their expectations.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re probably wondering if there’s a point to
all this and I guess it’s just that I goofed last month. I not only
moved the canned peaches, I restocked the shelves with kiwi, guava, and
mandarin oranges in heavy syrup. I challenged people’s expectations. And
you can’t do that to your customers. So, I ask you for one more chance
to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thanks for teaching me an important lesson.
What makes a family is love, not blood.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: All is fair in “Heaven,” Ted-baby.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s right. And guess who’s the new King of
the Unemployment Line.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I’m
your uncle for gosh sakes.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: “It’s easy to fall prey to petty jealousy
when considering the young life of Ted Nelson. But how would any of us
behave if one day all our dreams came true? Would we handle it half as
well? Would we find ourselves making the same mistakes for which we
criticize him?”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: “One can only hope that Ted Nelson will find
bigger and better dreams upon which to set his sights as the years pass.
And that he will remember, always, where he came from.”</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Page three.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow
journalism.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He kicked major ass and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: This one’s for you Dick Merkin of Tecumseh High.
From all your students. With hugs and kisses.</p>
<p><strong>barbra streisand</strong>: “People/People who need People/Are
the luckiest people in the world.”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why so melancholy?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You were born naked, wet, and hungry. Now
you’re hip, handsome, and rich. You are the coxswain on the ship of
life.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Eat, Drink, and Screw Mary!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I taught him that.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point,
the world is your oyster. You scored big.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You got everything you ever wanted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Except the girl. The only one that really
mattered.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: And who might that be? Miss July? Miss
August?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid
I’d never see you again.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m not going anywhere, Ted. You’re the one
with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need
to go to college, learn a few things, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And I thought maybe I’d take up boating. I’ve
always wanted to be a “coxswain.”</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Very ambitious. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The thing is, I’ll need a first mate.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know where you can find any number of naked
girls who’d love to hop on board.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Julie, you were right. All the naked girls in
the world mean nothing. It’s the one you want to cover up with your coat
that you really love.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Planet Ted. Five years from now. What’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum
laude and all. And I’m about to launch a brand new magazine called
“EXPOSED!” An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know where you can find an excellent
editor-in-chief.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yellow pages?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Let your fingers do the walking.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: They’re playing our song. Dare I ask for this
dance?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You better.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m a sucker for a happy ending. Hold
me.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So, as you can guess, everybody pretty much
lived happily ever after. My parents didn’t give up the grocery
store…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …but they did manage to sneak away for a second
honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Merk’s appearance in “Heaven” turned out to be
a good thing. He was spotted by a talent scout…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …and went on a European summer tour, fulfilling
his lifelong dream. Naturally he brought Poochie, the only girl he ever
really loved.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: After graduation, Charlie moved to Utah…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …where he married all three of the identical
Taylor Triplets. Let’s just say, they’ve been very busy…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And even Uncle Billy landed on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …with a two year subscription to “Heaven,”
you get a free underwater calculator.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And now if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll get
back to being the coxswain on the ship of life.</p>
