<h1 id="something-s-gotta-give">something-s-gotta-give</h1>
<p><strong>over black</strong>: We hear, Ja Rule’s “Livin’ It Up”…</p>
<p><strong>ext. new york city - a hot august night - music
over</strong>: MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body. A Club in THE
MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get in. A couple of Gorgeous
Girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly” let inside. SOHO. A
Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A Confident Knock Out
in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking a beer out of the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahhhh… The sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction
of The Younger Woman. That fleeting age when everything just falls right
into place. It’s magic time and it can render any man, anywhere –
absolutely helpless. Some say I’m an expert on The Younger Woman. Guess
that’s ’cause I’ve been dating them for over forty years…</p>
<p><strong>into an empty frame comes harry langer</strong>: What is it
about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his mouth…something about this
guy is just so damn appealing. Maybe it’s just the way he wears the
Young Slinky Girl on his arm. He’s confident, cool, enviable. We’re
in:</p>
<p><strong>a chic eatery - downtown</strong>: The place is full.
Everybody is somebody here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Langer. ..</p>
<p><strong>maitre’d</strong>: Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So what does a life of bucking the system all
add up to?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: To never settle down with the right woman for
a life of leftovers and Christmas mornings. No his and her IRA accounts,
no mini van parked in the garage. I think it’s made me what I am today.
The luckiest son of a bitch on earth. Look at me. I’m positively
debonair. I should be illegal I’m lookin’ so good.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It isn’t as if I haven’t wondered what my
life would be like if I was a Regular Joe and came in here once a month
with a dame my age’ for a porterhouse and a side of</p>
<p><strong>nt. chic eatery - harry’s imagination</strong>: Harry ENTERS
all over again. This time he looks older, something in his walk and the
boxy cut of his jacket. With him is a regular looking,
nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, come on, let’s be honest. ..a dame really
my age. . .</p>
<p><strong>int. chic eatery - harry’s imagination - take two</strong>:
Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he looks ten
years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The twinkle in his eye,
long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD BATTLE AX, built just like Harry.
The Maitre’d reluctantly shows them to a shitty table.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There you have it. The story in a nutshell.
Not exactly debonair, am I? Awww, man, it’s down right sad. Look at me.
I look like I’m about to die. God help me. I do not want to die.</p>
<p><strong>a long stretch of pristine country road - the hamptons -
day</strong>: A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry’s
behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin’ large. Next to him
sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An “IT” Girl. Smart, sexy and built for
fun. She has perfected flirting to an art. Her hand rests on Harry’s
neck. There’s a good thirty year age difference between them. Her name
is MARIN. She SINGS along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: To all my thugs that be livin’ it up, we say,
what I do. To all my… Oh! This is it. Make a right.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So baby, you’re rich… .</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Well, my mother is, sort of. Not really…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If she lives within a mile of here, she’s
rich.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I guess a hit play will buy you a house in
The Hamptons.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’d like to meet your mother.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: No you wouldn’t. I mean, she’s great. She’s
totally brilliant, but she’s not your type.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re overlooking one of the great things
about me. I don’t have a type.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: She’s over thirty.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh, what?! Like you don’t know you have a
slight reputation for…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: – For what?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: For never dating anyone over 30. Don’t look
at me like that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s just not true.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Okay. Sorry. Over 31?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, so you wait ’til we get out to The
Hamptons to let me know you’re a wise ass. Hold on. . . It just so
happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don’t date me. You ever
think of it that way? No, it’s always me. You dames are all alike.
Hey…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Dames…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Vh-huh.. .I’ll call back Monday. Who else?
Monday… Monday… Say you couldn’t find me. Who? I’ll call her later. No,
I have it.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Make a right, left at the second fence.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Have I mentioned how gorgeous your breasts
look in this sweater?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Yes you have actually.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So it would be too much to mention it again.
. .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow. It’s the perfect beach house.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I know. My mother doesn’t know how to do
things that aren’t perfect.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Which explains you.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Yeah, okay, right…</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: So, what are we gonna do out here, just the
two of us, for two whole days?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Tell me the truth, are you at all glad we
waited?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m incredibly glad we’re finally going to do
it. If that’s the same as being glad we waited, then baby doll, I’m
ecstatic.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s go for a swim, how long will it take
you to change?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh Har… No smoking in the house. My Mom
doesn’t allow it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But she allows you to strip in the front yard
and bring men you’re dating here to…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: She doesn’t know everything I do…Or when I do
it.. or where I do it.</p>
<p><strong>int. house</strong>: It’s one of those great Beach Houses.
Light filled and warm with spectacular views of the sandy landscape
wrapping around the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to undress.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: The fabulous living room, perfect for
entertaining an intimate group of friends or that special someone.
Behind me, the requisite Hampton’s deck complete with pool and ocean
view.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Your pants, please…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ladies first.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Gourmet kitchen’s to your left where tonight
I will whip you up a culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: .. O-kay, going quickly now… Master bedroom
is that away…</p>
<p><strong>arin</strong>: And this as they say on ‘Cribs’, your favorite
show, is where the magic happens. Do we like it? Going once, going twice
…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sold.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: You know when I first started auctioneering
someone told me if I was nervous to just picture everyone in the
audience in their underwear. This sort of gives that a whole new
meaning.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why? You’re not nervous now, are you?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I’m always a little nervous.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So put on your bathing suit. I brought some
champagne, I’ll put it on ice.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Me like you, Harry Langer.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room</strong>: Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts,
Harry crosses through the Living ROOM, singing ‘Livin’ It Up’ to
himself. He reaches into his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal.
He sees himself in the mirror, sucks in his gut.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen</strong>: Well stocked, the best of everything.
Harry opens the door to the fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT,
the BACK DOOR OPENS and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle
of a lively conversation. One of them is ERICA, Marin’s Mother. The
other is Erica’s Younger Sister, ZOE. ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is
a poster girl for growing old. It’s actually hard to imagine 55 looking
any better. And not because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look
graceful and right. Erica is the “girl most likely” who went beyond
expectations but didn’t realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap. She doesn’t try to be intimidating, she just is.
Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe’s the loose one. She wears draw
string pants and a T-shirt that says, “BOYS LIE”. The Women stop
mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR IS WIDE OPEN. Then they
SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN’S LEGS poking</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don’ t move.</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: Oh God. What is this?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
knife.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you… live here?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, Mister, look, I’m gonna dial 911 and
you’re not gonna move. Zoe, hand me the phone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You don’t understand. I’m a friend of your
daughter’s.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah? I don’t think so. My daughter’s in the
city and you what, wandered in here,like high on Ecstasy..?. Shit. I
dialed 8-1-1.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honestly, if you just…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Back off. She was in the Israeli army. She
can break you in half.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes. I have an intruder in my house. 29
Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m dating your daughter Marin. She invited
me here for the weekend. She’s in her room right now, changing.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You’re dating my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now who would’ve thought that would be worse
news?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, God. I’m sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no,
I’m sure. No, he’s not a burglar He’s dating my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mom, I had no idea you were coming out this
weekend, you said you had to write.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I do. I thought I’d do it out here.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh, man, this is really….</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Awkward.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Totally.. .but…. You gotta admit, sorta funny
You thought he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah, well, the world’s nuts, I don’t know
the man. . .</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s not really funny. I’m an
idiot. I should’ve told you I was bringing someone out.</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: No, no, I should’ve told you we were coming.
Well. Anyway, here we are. Hello. I’m the mother.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Harry Langer. How are ya?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Yes. Sorry… Mom, this is my friend, Harry.
Harry, my Mom, Erica… my Aunt, Zoe. Harry’s sort of a new friend. I
think I mentioned him in an e-mail. We just, totally spur of the moment
thought we’d get out of the city for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>erica and zoe</strong>: Of course…Right…Great…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Honey, does Harry have a robe?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know what? Actually, I think I should
just take off. Let you gals enjoy your weekend…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, no, no. Don’t be silly. Uh, look, here’s
what we’ll do. Zoe and I will leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
we’ll go into town for lunch. You two stay. Harry, apologize about the
near arrest.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, you were impressive. Very strong, very…
“macho”.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I don’t think I was exactly “macho” …</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in his
underwear in my refrigerator I hope I’m half the man you were, Mrs
uh…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah. Okay. Whatever…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: All righty then…I’m definitely gonna hit the
road. Ladies…sensational meeting you. Doll, call me.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Hold on. Hold on. Let’s not get so dramatic
here. What are we four teenagers? We’re all sophisticated people. Why
can’t we all stay, for the weekend? Your mother’s got work to do I’ve
got papers to grade. You’ll do your thing, whatever that is and if we
want to hang together, we’ll hang together. If we don’t, we don’t.
There’s no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Seriously. I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I can totally handle it.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I mean, well, I can “handle” it…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It can only go up from here.</p>
<p><strong>harry and marin</strong>: Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG
IN EAST HAMPTON. They are both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS
BEHIND THEM.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: He’s obviously a penis substitute.</p>
<p><strong>erica and zoe</strong>: Are paced 20 feet behind them,
carrying groceries.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I mean a father substitute.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Except he’s older than her father. I can’t
even look at them. What is she doing with a guy that age?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Marin was how old when you guys broke up?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Okay, so she was old enough not to feel Dave
was walking out on her.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out on
me? Why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the
guy’s the one who wanted out? Just because once we broke up he shtupped
everything that moved…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Easy cowgirl. I didn’t mean it that way. Just
trying to figure out why such a smart girl is always with the wrong
guy.</p>
<p><strong>young french girl</strong>: Mme. Barry, que je puis vous
obtenir aujourd’hui?</p>
<p><strong>the barefoot contessa</strong>: A Gourmet Market in East
Hampton. The clientele in here is as rich looking as the food. Erica
stands on the other side of the Cheese Counter.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Bonjour je veux une partie de votre pate
merveilleux et de votre meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s impressive.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: She started French lessons after she and my
Dad split up. Part of her “Keep Busy, Don’t Look Back” program. She’s
practically fluent now.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou
devrions jefaire quelgue chose?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Laissons quelque chose d’achat. Et ce grand
gateau de chocolat?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, not bad.. .</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Yeah…well. ..I am fluent. Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s an epidemic.</p>
<p><strong>oung french girl</strong>: Merci madame.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Woops. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My fault.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: So, Harry… What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m one of the owners of a record company
among other things…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, really? Which record company?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Drive by Records.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: “Drive By” Records??? Is that a joke? What is
that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s a Hip Hop label.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well. Okay.
That’s… “interesting”…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let me see if I get where you’re headed here.
. .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m sorry, but, look, you know I hate rap, I
mean I do. It’s sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention
just a tad misogynistic.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, a lot of people see rapping as
poetry.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah, but come on, how many words can you
rhyme with ‘Bitch’?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: How we doin?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Should’ve left when she tried to arrest
me.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s dining room - that night</strong>: Marin serves
plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and Erica tosses a salad.
Harry is the only one sitting.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: So, Mom, how’s the new play? You gettin’
happy with it?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well, the thing with me is that I’m about 90%
hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn’t exactly kicked
in yet.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Yeah, right…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s your play about?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: About? Well, I’m not exactly sure which is a
bit of a problem, but so far it’s about a divorced woman, a writer,
she’s this high strung, over-amped, controlling, know it all neurotic. .
. Who’s incredibly cute and lovable. It’s a comedy.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: So, how did you two meet?</p>
<p><strong>arin</strong>: At a Wine Auction at Sotheby’s. Harry was the
big buyer of the night.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I kept winking at Marin as she was conducting
the auction and apparently every time I did that she misunderstood and I
ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Ever been married, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. No, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Wow. Now why do you think that is?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Some people just don’t fit the mold. And so
far…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hey, if it ain’t broke.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Wait a second, aren’t you like a famous
bachelor?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I wouldn’t say I’m famous.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No, I think I read a piece on you in New York
Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I guess people find it interesting that I’ve
escaped the noose for so long.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Yeah, wasn’t the name of the article, “The
Escape Artist”?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Wait. I read that article. That was you? You
were once engaged to somebody big. Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.
..Carly Simon?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Yeah, it was somebody cool like that. Not
Martha Stewart….</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: You could just ..’ask him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, this is more fun. It’s like I’m not
here.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Harry was once engaged to Diane Sawyer.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, women your age love that about me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s not a bad thing to say ‘women your
age’.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No…I’m sure it was a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It was. ..just the truth.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: So when was this engagement?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Long time ago. She was just this adorable
lanky girl from Kentucky with the greatest pair of legs I’d ever seen…
Never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed
them.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You’re not serious? She’s Diane Sawyer, she
goes into caves in Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her head. Who cares
about her legs?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just anyone who’s ever had the pleasure of…
You know what? I hate to eat and run but…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No, wait. This is actually a very fascinating
dynamic - what’s going on at this table…</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: oe teaches Women’s Studies at Columbia. . .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, so this is gonna hurt.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No, come on, listen, here’s the rub for women.
Look at what we have here with you and Erica. Harry, you’ve been around
the block a few times, right? You’re what? Around 60, never been
married, which, we all know, if you were a woman, would be a curse,
you’d be an old maid, a spinster, blah, blah, blah… Okay, so instead of
pitying you, they write articles about you, celebrate your never
marrying, it makes you illusive and ungettable. You’re a real catch.
Then, take my gorgeous sister here…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Any chance of you stopping here?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Come on, this is interesting. I mean, look at
her, she’s so accomplished, the most successful woman playwright since
who? Lillian Hellman? She’s over fifty, divorced and still sits in night
after night because the available guys her age want</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen - moments later</strong>: OVER, we Erica is
cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to help.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What are you, possessed? How could you say
those things?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: It just seemed so obvious to me. The injustice
of it. Thank God men die younger than us. It’s the only break we
get.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Then you know what? Write a dissertation on
it, don’t announce to the world that I stay in night after night after
night and by the way, one night after night would have been enough. Did
you ever realize, I stay “in” as part of my job. Why do you think I
married the director of my plays? He was the only man I ever saw.
Anyway, I like staying in and I like this time in my life. Why do I have
to defend myself?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I’m sorry, I thought I was onto something.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Honey, what are you doing with this guy? He’s
old, he’s chauvinistic…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: He’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He’s fun? How is he fun? He’s like..
.wrong.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Wrong can be fun, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Not this wrong.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Can we not do this now? He’s actually
incredibly smart and fascinating and if you had talked to him about
something other than his marital status you would’ve found out how smart
he is. He owns like 10 different companies…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What does that mean he owns ten different
companies? He can’t commit, that’s what that means. Not that, God
forbid, I want him to commit.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he thought
you two were very spontaneous and nice and then said he’s leaving as
soon as the sun comes up.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What? His car doesn’t have headlights?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Wait. I have no right to get this nuts. He’s
your friend. Not mine. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I love you more.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No chance he said we were nice.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Please. None.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: What are they listening to?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I don’t care… Oy. Marvin Gaye. . .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know she’ll never see him after this
weekend. She can’t commit either.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: He does sound fun.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Admit it, he’s got something. You felt it,
right?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, this is nuts…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Did she say, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>int. marin’s room - angle - the door</strong>: Erica and Zoe
bust into the room and find Harry .on the floor, leaning against the
bed, a clenched fist on his chest. His shirt is open, he’s sweating, his
complexion is grey. Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near
him.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: We were fooling around and he said he felt
funny Hthen he just collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: It’s nothing. I’m okay maybe it was the
lobster…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Does your chest hurt?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Like an elephant’s standing on it.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Call 911…tell them to send an ambulance. .
.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Marin! Now!</p>
<p><strong>harry’s pov - the room</strong>: Spinning. When he shuts his
eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin,
soft in the background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He
hears Zoe:</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Mouth to mouth…</p>
<p><strong>on harry</strong>: Even in this state he gets that Erica is
about to place her. mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels
back. Erica catches this.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You fucking guy…</p>
<p><strong>and a loud clang</strong>: As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON
HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into
the ER with dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney
and</p>
<p><strong>onto a bed.</strong>: DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry’s
side. Julian is in his early-thirties and has finally just graduated out
of the ‘you look too young to be a doctor’ syndrome. Julian is a man
whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier than you’d
expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins graduate who chose to
live near the beach and work nights. The Nurses place oxygen in Harry’s
nose, .;hook him up to a heart monitor and connect him to an IV.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: How we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic #1</strong>: He’s had 30 minutes of chest pain,
nausea, shortness of breath, blood pressure’s 170 over 100, pulse 104,
respirations 18…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Let’s get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I’m
Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain right now?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Feel some pressure in my chest…it’s real
tight.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Can you show me where the pain is?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What were you doing at the onset of the
pain?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was uh, kissing a beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Where you having intercourse?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: – Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: ense of humor in tact… Hang a nitroglycerine
drip. Mr. Langer the EKG shows you have a blocked artery which is not
allowing enough oxygen to get to the heart muscle.. .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m having a heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: We’re gonna stop it. But I need to know what
kind of medications you take?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I take uh… uh. . . Lipitor. . .</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Uh-huh… .Any thing else?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: – and a white one for blood pressure. . .</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: procardia?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What about, Viagra?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra today?
Mr. Langer?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. No Viagra.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You’re positive?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t take Viagra. Don’t need Viagra.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Great. Just needed to be sure because I put
nitroglycerin into your-drip and if you had taken Viagra, the combo
would make your heart leap right out of your body…</p>
<p><strong>close - harry’s eyes - panicked</strong>: As he watches the
NITROGLYCERIN make it’s way DOWN THE TUBE and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as
the amber liquid is about to enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out
of his arm. The drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin hangs back.
Harry catches the look on her face.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Let’s give him an aspirin and Metoprolol
5mg…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry, had an audience…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: It’s okay. ..it was a great save. Let’s
start the thrombolytic protocol. “4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
this works and I have every reason to believe it will, it’s going to
reverse what’s going on so there will be little or no damage to your
heart. You with me? Okay, here we go.</p>
<p><strong>the hallway</strong>: Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe
leans against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh, man, what if he doesn’t make it? I don’t
know who to contact.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I don’t know his family. I’ve gone out to
dinner with the guy three times. I hardly know him.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He’s gonna make it. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: He’s like a bulldog. He’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>arin</strong>: This is a nightmare. I go out with a guy who’s
so old, he takes Viagra.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Are you nuts? You go out with a guy who’s so
old he’s having a heart attack!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: All I can say is, thank God it didn’t happen
when he was inside you. That could be life altering.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Your Dad’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh, he’s not my Dad…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I’m sorry. Your Grandad’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh, thank you so much. But he’s not my… oh
we’re not related. He’s just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I’m Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a mild
heart attack. I gave him something to break up the clot in his artery
and it worked beautifully.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: His EKG returned to normal almost
immediately which means I don’t expect any permanent damage. He’s very
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thank you. . .</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: No, whoever got him here so fast should be
thanked. Another half hour and I don’t know if this would’ve worked.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, man… This was…intense.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: We’re out of the woods. I’ve given him
something to sleep, it might make him a little loopy at first but then
it should knock him out. You’re Mrs. Langer?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, no I’m just… No. I’m Erica Barry. . He
was having dinner at our house. I just met him this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You’re Erica Barry?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: The playwright?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What a pleasure. I’m a huge fan. Huge
fan.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Really? Oh, thanks… This is my daughter,
Marin, my sister, Zoe…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>close - a japanese tea pot</strong>: Julian pours steaming
hot tea into 3 paper cups.</p>
<p><strong>marin - close</strong>: Sitting in the hospital corridor as
JULIAN’S HAND ENTERS HER FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up
at him with more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows
on</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: the steam.</p>
<p><strong>arin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Thank you Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You’re welcome. May I join you?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: First year of medical school you learn what
can keep you up all night without making you nuts. Green Tea beats
everything plus it’s a great antioxidant. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: So, urn, do you always work nights?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Usually two or-three a week, gives me a
chance for a real life during the day. . . You know, I heard you had a
place in the Hamptons. I really am a very big fan. I honestly think I’ve
seen every play you’ve ever written.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I think some were written before your time.
There are some Marin’s never even seen.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: No, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen them all and I
saw the last one twice.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Doctor, we’ve got a walk in, may need
stitches. . .</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I’ll check on MI. Langer…if he’s asleep; you
all might want to get some shut eye and come back in the morning. Great
to meet you Erica. Ladies. . .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, now that’s a perfect a guy for you.
He’s adorable.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mother! I’ve never seen a man less interested
in me.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Or more interested in you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Me? He’s thirty years old.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: No, he’s older than that.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Who cares how old, he is. I mean, he’s not my
type, he’s like a gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he’s perfect for you
and hot for you, which makes him really perfect.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Stop it. He likes my work. Not me. It’s
insane. I would never. Shut. Up.</p>
<p><strong>z</strong>: Gown, pretty out of it.</p>
<p><strong>oe</strong>: Yuh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Harry….</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Harry! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, I want to go home. Can you call Lowell
to pick me up?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Lowell?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Harry, you have to get back in bed.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Woman. And I say that as a compliment… You
saved my life. Soft.. . I don’t remember your name but I thank you from
the bottom of my…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Ugh. Look at this, even unconscious, he’s a
lech.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mr. Langer, you shouldn’t be standing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Got to take a whiz girls.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: We’ll take care of that for you,
Mr. Langer.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay. You take care of it for me, sweetheart.
I’d like to see that…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: This is the most insane night of my life.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Yeah, but just admit that was one great ass for
a guy that age.</p>
<p><strong>close - a large vase of yellow roses - 36 hours
later</strong>: A Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her
station.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Now what can I do you for?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m here for Mr. Harry Langer.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Yes we are. Hi, I’m Dr. Mercer. Come on,
I’ll take you to him.</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and
shopping bags.</p>
<p><strong>ulian</strong>: And you are. . ?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Lowell St. James’. Mr. Langer’s houseman,
chef… general valet..</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Well that sounds like a pretty, interesting
job.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.</p>
<p><strong>a private room</strong>: where Harry lies on the bed, dressed
and ready to go. He squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms’s distance
called, “Heart Attack – Bouncing Back”.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Okay, Harry, looks like we’re going to have
to let you go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Take it easy kids, I just sat up too fast.
Doc, tell them. Am I in good shape? How were my tests this morning?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: He’s doing extremely well.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Can I hug him?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, Okay. Let’s not get goofy. We got no
thin , but good news here.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I must say, you do look good… considering.
You have a little extra baggage under your eyes, but I know how to fix
that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: See what good hands I’m in. Did you meet my
gorgeous assistants?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Not formally.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Girls… .my Doctor, Julian Mercer. Honey, did
you bring the CDs?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: These are for you… The man loves Hip Hop.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Maybe not this much but…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And did you bring the other thing?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is just to thank you for your brilliance
the other night. I hope it suits you.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the most
gorgeous watch I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: - Oh, good. It’s a Piaget. He likes it.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: No, I love it and this is incredibly
generous of you but I can’t accept it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You save my life and you end up with some
CDs?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: No, I end up seeing you walk out of here and
I do get paid you know -</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: – Knock, knock.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to
Harry, more reserved than normal.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Harry, I’ll see you on the way out.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: We’ll pull up the car.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So, I’m some great date, huh?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Yeah… Mr. Excitement.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell me somethin’, we haven’t actually had
sex yet, have we?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: No we haven’t. You’re correct on that
one.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Something to live for.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Down to the cheek. Come on, let’s get outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. southampton hospital - day</strong>: Harry is wheeled
out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on either side. In the parking
lot is a Town Car with Lowell and the Girls standing next to it. Next to
them is Erica, waiting by her car. She’s on her cell phone. Harry spots
them and tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Hold on Tarzan, we’re still movin’ … Okay,
now slow-ly.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look at these faces. Will you tell them I’m
fine.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!</p>
<p><strong>close on julian</strong>: taking Harry’s pulse as Harry lies
on the ASPHALT OF THE HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants
and Marin huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Harry, I’m sorry, but I think we jumped the
gun.. .can’t let you travel quite yet.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I ain’t goin’ back in there.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You don’t have to but I can’t put you in a
car right now and I can’t leave you in the parking lot. I’d like you to
stay nearby for a few days and let me keep an eye on you ’til you get
your strength back.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Doc, I’m out in the middle of the Hamptons.
Where do you want me to go?</p>
<p><strong>ext. erica’s house - later that day.</strong>: The Town Car
sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood, talking on her cell. A
Market Delivery Van pulls away as a Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A
Flower Delivery KID holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>nt. the guest bedroom - same time</strong>: Harry sits up in
bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit cigar, and is on the phone.
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower filled
dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim stands nearby on
the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just promise me you won’t make a decision
until we talk. Thinking about it ain’t promising me. Okay, man, I’m
seein’ you Friday… Lowell, what was that?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Your lunch.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Somebody tell you to starve me to death?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Russell.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Rush? No, man, you’re livin’ the shit. I just
got a clean bill of health.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen</strong>: Erica puts away groceries, a little on
edge. Her back is to a Man in his fifties, who sits at the island,
eating a sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural
expression is – worried. This is DAVE.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: This is the best turkey sandwich I ever had in
my life. What kind of mustard is this?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: All right, don’t get pissy. It’s not Dijon,
right?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Don’t get pissy. ..you say that ’cause this,
of course, would never happen to you. .1 come out here for peace and
quiet and suddenly I’m a character in a Kaufman and Hart play. And the
phone does not stop. And it’s never for me!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That’s fine Lowell, I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, please, allow me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, no, I’ll take it. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: The man does not know my name and I’m doing
his dishes.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Hi Erica. Um…where should I put</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: this?</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: Right here. I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: And Harry has a headache. Do you have any
Tylenol?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Tylenol yes. ..</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Hi. I’m Lexi, Harry’s second assistant.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey…Dave Klein. How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Where should I put this? It’s an empty water
glass. What are the choices?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m gettin’ outta your hair.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So you’re not ready to show me any pages? I’m
not putting pressure on you, I’m just asking.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I haven’t written a word. I’m on page twelve
and the first eleven pages stink.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: So you have one good page. How tall do you
think that girl was?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Dad! I didn’t know you were here.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I’m just on my way out, bubbee.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Well, I was just gonna drive into the city
with Zoe but if you’re driving back, I’d much rather go with you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I have to meet someone before I go…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Wait wait wait wait. You’re leaving, Zoe’s
leaving, the entourage is leaving. And I’m supposed to stay here with
him alone?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: The doctor said” he’s ’sending over a Nurse
in the morning…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: The morning? That’s nineteen hours from now…
Okay, I can handle this. I’m just going to get into a zen’ place, play
music, cook, write, focus…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: She never changes…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes. Maybe that’s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. erica’s house - sunset</strong>: No cars are out front.
Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack we hear the French tune, I wish
You Love sung in French.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s kitchen - the same time - music over</strong>:
Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Smells great in here.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Coq au Vin…</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: Chicken cooked in red wine…</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: French Food… French music…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Part of my play takes place in Paris so I’m
hoping this helps me think. I’m hopin’…How you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I walked all the way in here, only
bumping into two chairs and an ottoman.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Everyone bumps into that ottoman.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, thanks for letting me…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah, no…it’s fine. Hello. Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hello. Hey sweets… Oh, you got the flowers?
Are they pretty?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, can I call you in a little bit. What’s
your number doll?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay… Call you in a little.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Same prescription…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Look, Harry, it’s not like in any stretch of
the imagination, I think you’re all that right for my daughter but I
don’t really appreciate hearing you on the phone with other women. It’s
like I’m an accomplice to you cheating, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Your daughter knows I see other women.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: She does? I mean, fine, it’s none of my
business…but…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She knows I’m not monogamous…We’ve discussed
it.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Great? And that’s what? Why are you proud of
that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter said
she likes that about me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: My daughter is confused when it comes to
men.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t blame her. We’re confusing.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot - almost night</strong>: Erica and Harry sit not so
close together at a long table, under a purple sky. Another French Tune
plays. If this wasn’t them, this would look romantic.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong>: othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry
lifts the salt shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Should I just call the ambulance now?</p>
<p><strong>ext. house - night - over - louis armstrong’s la vie en
rose</strong>: A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR
THE</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s bedroom - same time - music continues</strong>:
Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us it’s a
little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she points her
remote at the CD Player and stops’ the song. Harry answers the phone in
his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her remote, starts the song
again, starts typing again. Now the other line RINGS. She looks over at
the phone watching one RED LIGHT “BLINK, while the other line is
answered.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s bedroom - same time</strong>: Harry is on the
phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is unbuttoned, his hair is
allover the place. His bed is a mess, laptop open, newspapers spilling
onto the floor. Erica stands in the doorway. He quickly hides his
cigar.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can you hold a see, doll? Hey.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, here’s the thing. I really don’t want
to play the part of the uptight Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
want to have another heart attack, go ahead, it’s your life but I have
work to do and I don’t have time to make another run to the hospital
because you’re filling your already clogged arteries with smoke but more
importantly, I’d rather not have my house smell like a pool hall.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I have a question for you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What? Do I Hhave to say what?</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: Have you always been like this or do I bring
this out in you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever had this effect on a
woman before.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: And what effect do you think you’re having on
me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t quite recognize it, that’s how I know
I’ve never had it before.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So you don’t sleep?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I only need about four hours a night.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me too. Never slept eight hours in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Me either. I wish I could. ..but… Want me to
shut these, sun comes in pretty strong in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure. . . thanks. . .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Who you talking to at this hour?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A friend in L.A. It’s only ten out there.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: And that’s not past her bedtime?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So you don’t get more mellow as the hours
pass?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Good night, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can I ask you one other thing? What’s with
the turtlenecks? It’s the middle of summer.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Now seriously, why do you care what I
wear?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just curious.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I like them. I’ve always liked them. I’m just
a turtleneck kinda gal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You ever get hot?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Never?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Not lately.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s bedroom - night</strong>: Almost TWO. Erica is
writing, her eyes go to the phone with the typing paper over it. She
LIFTS a corner of the paper, takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT.
Finally. “Erica turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has
rattled her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn’t like
it. She stands, starts to undress.</p>
<p><strong>erica - naked - tight shot</strong>: She crosses through the
room on her way to the Bathroom. She passes by her partially open door,
happens to look out INTO</p>
<p><strong>harry - planted right in front of her</strong>: Seeing it
all.</p>
<p><strong>erica - screams</strong>: and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: flustered, spins around, loses his balance,
crashes into the wall, covers his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What are you doing?!?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Trying to find the kitchen!</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Back here???</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn’t
really see anything. Just your tits and a little of your-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is gonna be murder.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - the next morning</strong>: A very wide
MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room toward the Front Door.
Just as she opens the door, Erica ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck,
long skirt. Pretty much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Good bye Mrs. Barry.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Good bye? You’re leaving? That’s not
good.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Been fired.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Fired? You just started.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not fired darlin’. Just not needed.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What do you mean, not needed? Of course we
need her. She’s gonna take care of you and feed you and…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: – No, no, I’m actually feeling pretty perky
today. Making quite a recovery. . . Sorry for the trouble Mrs. Gimble…
Take care, dear.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Listen, about last night.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah. How ’bout we never talk about that? I
was at the drugstore. Your prescriptions were ready. They said take
these two with food and this one without.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honestly, you were in silhouette.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I think that’s talkin’ about it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I really didn’t see all that much.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yip. There you go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay. Won’t mention it again but…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Goin’ to work, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You saw my ass, you don’t see me acting nuts,
wearing hats and glasses and weird get ups…</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s bedroom</strong>: Harry and Julian sit on the
bed. Julian takes Harry’s blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes or no. What’s the deal, can I go?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You still getting dizzy?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not as much.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Out of breath?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Only sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: How’s Erica treating you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Erica. . .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Her? Oh, she’s a major piece of work. The
woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of the summer.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s beyond uptight. Almost makes her fun to
be around.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Uptight? That’s funny. I haven’t noticed
that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Try livin’ with her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I actually saw her naked last night.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: That doesn’t sound so uptight.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It was an accident. She thought I was asleep,
I thought her room was the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You know what Freud said - there are no
accidents.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Trust me. This was an accident. Although, why
would she be walking around naked when she knows I’m 20 feet away.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Why would you think her bedroom was the
kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It was dark, it was two in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: That could explain why she was walking
around naked. Deep breath…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know I’ve never seen a woman that age
naked before.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, we’re not all doctors.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Well, I think she’s very beautiful and she’s
a fantastic writer, you know.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Erica Barry? She’s pretty major. So, you
date her daughter?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, now she’s a great chick. Must take
after the father. Which reminds me…Doc, what When can I be up and
running in that department?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay put for
another couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But it won’t kill me when I do it, right?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: It’s exercise. It’ll be good for you. And
just so you know, I’m told after a heart attack, if you can climb a
flight of stairs, you can have sex.</p>
<p><strong>a low angle of a staircase</strong>: Which goes from the
beach up to Erica’s deck. Harry stands at the bottom of the stairs in
his robe, velvet slippers and sunglasses.’ He looks up to the top of the
stairs as if it’s Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps.
Not bad. After two more, he’s out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with himself,
he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one more…and then, he’s
so out of breath, he can barely move, yet he reaches up the railing and
tries to hike himself up one more.</p>
<p><strong>int . kitchen - same time</strong>: The tea kettle WHISTLES
as Erica and Julian stand on either side of her island. Erica reaches
for a tea bag.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: So, you’re saying, he’s not ready to travel
at all? Not even by plane? Train?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I don’t think so… It’s been tough, huh?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well, he fired the Nurse after an hour, now
says he doesn’t need one. He’s a bit of a workout.. .yeah.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: How are you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, fine. .I’m fine, I’m…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: One more fine and I won’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, shoot, hold on… Hello. Hey…Oh, hi…</p>
<p><strong>angle - julian</strong>: Smitten. Just something about her.
Watching her.</p>
<p><strong>angle - erica</strong>: Not noticing, pouring water for her
tea.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, I’m finally getting to it…</p>
<p><strong>ulian</strong>: Pick you up around seven?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: W-What about the patient?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Like he said, he doesn’t need a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s bedroom - late afternoon - music over</strong>:
Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD player. As much
as she doesn’t want it to be true, this attention from Julian has fueled
her.</p>
<p><strong>the living room - same time - music over</strong>: Harry,
dressed for the first time, wearing khaki’s and a summer shirt, strolls
through the Living Room a bit cautious.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m Walking Around The house!</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Listen, I’ve decided to get over the whole
“you saw me naked” thing. So, we don’t have to deal with it anymore.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good, ’cause I’ve been hiding from you all
day.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know. You want to come in?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t want to break your rhythm or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That would be wishful thinking.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Beautiful painting. So I’m gonna venture out
there and go for a short walk…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You up to that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My doctor recommended it. I gotta build up to
stairs and stuff like that. You wouldn’t want to join me?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That means you don’t want me to?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, I was asking if you wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, well, I would but…I don’t usually like to
break once I’ve started writing so I probably shouldn’t, not that a
little fresh air would hurt but…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s just a walk Erica, not a marriage
proposal.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You know my name.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up on the
internet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach - moments later - late .in the day</strong>: Erica
and Harry walk by the water’s edge. They are the only two people on the
beach.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: – Did you know there are over eight thousand
websites that mention you?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That can’t be possible.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, it’s true. I know everything about you
now. And not because of last night, but…</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: Yeah, I understood. I actually looked you up
too. You grew up in L.A., which I thought nobody did.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You were the road manager for a group I sorta
never heard of, started your own record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small
record company which you turned into the 2nd largest Hip Hop label in
the world.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s exhausting just hearing about it.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know, but the truth is, it goes fast
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Like the blink of an eye.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I noticed you have bowls of those all over
your house.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know, I’m crazy, I just think they’re so
beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But why do you only pick up the white
ones?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I don’t only pick up the white ones.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, so you really are crazy.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I pick up only the white ones? Oh, God, what
does that mean? I’m controlling, unadventurous, what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So you’re as hard on yourself as you are on
everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Something to remember me by.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: So can I ask you something Harry? What’s with
all the young girls? I mean, what’s the story there, really?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just like to travel light.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You just like to travel light? Oh, please,
what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now see a thirty year old gets that.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You mean falls for that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I mean, accepts it.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: If that’s what you want… a non threatening
woman, who won’t get your number, you get to run the show…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think our relationship is growing by the
way. Have you noticed?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m serious. Maybe we just needed to get out
of the house. Now, you may notice, interestingly, we’re walking back
toward the house and its getting a little rocky again.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Of course it’s getting a little rocky, we’re
talking about you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: See, I’ll accept that slight hostility
because I’m enjoying your company so much.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hey’re reached the bottom of the beach stairs.
Harry looks up, daunted.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, but I think I’11 stay down here and
watch the sunset. You interested?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Big dinner date?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well, yeah, as a matter of fact. With your
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ohhhhh, my doctor, ’cause he’s not too young
for you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, he’s totally too young for me. But we’re
just having dinner. It’s not a date.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Does he know that?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well, I’ll tell him, but I doubt that he
thinks of it that way.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you may
like it. Think of it this way – he’s not threatening, won’t get your
number, you get to run the show. You might have a hell of a time.</p>
<p><strong>that night - the front door - swings open</strong>: And we
find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope. Dream Date.</p>
<p><strong>and on the other side of the door</strong>: is Harry, in his
robe and PJ’s.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Hey, look who’s answering the door.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And look who’s at the door.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: A heart healthy dinner from our
cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: We ready..?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Let me just see how Harry’s doing. It’ll
take two seconds. Har, have a seat. .</p>
<p><strong>angle - harry</strong>: sitting, self-conscious in his new
role - The Sick One. Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry
looks straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees - erica’s legs</strong>: as she sits right in
front of him. She crosses her legs and her dress hikes up a little,
exposing her thigh. JULIAN furrows his brow.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What? That’s not the face you want to see
your doctor making.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Your pulse is a little fast but maybe you’re
just excited about something.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t think so. I’m not excited about
anything.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: There it goes again. Racing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Doc… Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Oh, there we go, now I feel better. Back to
normal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, all right, good, have fun, don’t rush
back for me and don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well that wouldn’t leave us too many options
would it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And do we wonder how she writes that snappy
repartee. Let him pick up the check. It’ll make him feel older.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - later that night - a ben webster cd
plays</strong>: Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry’s body,
past the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:</p>
<p><strong>arin</strong>: Hi, it’s Marin, I’m not in so leave a message
and I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, it’s me…just sitting around looking at
your baby pictures… Thinking about you…</p>
<p><strong>another young woman’s voice</strong>: Hi and HI, you’ve
reached Brooke and Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Everybody’s out but old Har.. .Old, old old
old Har…</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s bedroom - moments later</strong>: Harry wanders
in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He notices a bowl filled
with white beach stones. Harry’s brown stone sits at the top of the
pile.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Top of the heap…</p>
<p><strong>close on julian</strong>: Staring at Erica. He can’t get
enough of her. They’re in a ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica’s
blushing for the first time in twenty-five years.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: – So, when the land came up, I snatched it
and the house was built in record time and… It’s like a thousand degrees
in here.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You know, they say doctors fall for people
who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Really? I never heard that one. Julian, how
old are you, like…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: – Thirty-three.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I’m twenty years
older than you. More than twenty years older than you.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You look fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thank you but you know, I’m not sure where
you were headed with that thing you were just saying, but in terms of
us, you just want to be friends, right?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Honestly? No.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well, then, what is it that you… want to
be?</p>
<p><strong>ulian</strong>: I think I’d embarrass you if I told you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I was embarrassed just getting dressed to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: This may surprise you but some women
consider me quite the guy. I’ve never been married. I’m a doctor. You
wouldn’t believe what catnip that is for some women.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh yes I would. But, you don’t like girls
your own age?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I do very much. But I’ve never met one I’ve
taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that’s never
happened to you before, don’t you have to at least find out what it
is?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I suppose but, see, I don’t date all that
much or all that well…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Oh, come on, you must beat them away with a
stick.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Now you’re kidding, right? No, guys my age,
the ones I’ve met…well, I’m not that regular a person and they really
like regular.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Men your age may be really stupid, you ever
think of that?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes I have. Many times.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: There’s something radically wrong with the
idea that no one loves you.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I knew you’d smell good.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s just…soap…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: How much is soap that smells like this?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I don’t know. I got it at the market.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Erica, you’re incredibly sexy.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, swear to God, I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>meanwhile, harry is sound asleep on erica’s bed</strong>: Her
scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF ACAR pulling up
to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit. He leaps out of bed, this is the
fastest he’s moved in days. A bit disoriented, he straightens the
covers, looks around for other evidence then hightails it out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - a moment later</strong>: Erica enters,
letting out a huge sigh. She’s brought back to reality when she hears
the TV in Harry’s room. She heads his way, then changes her mind and
stops.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m back…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You have fun?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It was interesting. So… Good night.</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s room - same time</strong>: Harry’s in bed,
clearly disappointed that she didn’t stop in.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: ’Night…</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s bedroom - later</strong>: Erica, in pj’s and
glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She hears the CHIME of someone
INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U
doing?</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS. She
answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing? He writes: Watching Joan Rivers
sell jewelry. Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date? She
types: I think so… He types: I told ya. You hungry? Surprised, she
types: I just had dinner. He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on
dates.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: How does he know everything!</p>
<p><strong>int. living room</strong>: Erica and Harry ENTER FROM
OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in their pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We are cute…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: This is pretty unusual for me. I’m not used
to having sleepovers.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Really? With your social life?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My, dear, you are confusing sex with
sleeping. Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, good to know. So, what are you hungry
for?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are my choices? I mean I know you think
I’m not very discriminating but…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, God, what’s the difference what I think.
I can’t imagine what you think of me. Okay, so… Pasta, left over coq au
vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You ever miss being married? I bet you were
great at it.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not that
much anymore. Was one of us just saying something interesting?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You said you can’t imagine what I think of
you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, right, but you don’t have to answer
that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I mean, if you had an opinion, I’d be curious
but…’</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: will you tell me first why you only miss
being married at night?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, ’cause the phone doesn’t ring as much at
night and the “alone” thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took
some getting used to. But I got the hang of it. You gotta sleep in the
middle of the bed. It’s absolutely not healthy to have a side when no
one has the other side.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, now I’m convinced what I think of you
is right. You are a tower of strength.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Ughhhhhhhhhh… .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Try not to rate my answer.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just…I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re like a thoroughbred in a world of
mutts. No, you know what you are, you’re like a great portrait over a
fireplace. Words have been invented to describe women like you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Flinty and…Impervious.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: So you think I’m inhuman.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. I think you’re formidable.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: But cold and distant. Like I’m frozen in some
painting…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not at all. I think you’re strength defines
you. But it’s thrilling when your defenses are down arid you’re not
isolated. That, I believe, is your winning combo. A killer combo
actually.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: … So I can’t decide if you hate me or if
maybe you’re the only person who ever got me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t hate you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Room service!</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What are you doing here at this hour?</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: had this big photography auction</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: So how are you guys? Oh, this is too sweet.
You’re making pancakes? Awwww. And you’re both in your pj’s. Now I feel
I’m interrupting.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Don’t be silly. You know I never sleep and
this one doesn’t sleep either. It’s… .What’s in the bag?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: A quart of matzoh ball soup for Harry. I know
it’s not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: But high sodium.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your favorite
raisin-bread. And for me… My favorite Vodka.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Hello? No I’m here, babe. Made record time.
Everyone’s still there?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: So, Mar, now that you’re here, why don’t you
finish the pancakes and I’ll get back to work…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mom! I just got here, hold on.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: So your ex-husband stood me up today. We were
supposed to have lunch at Barneys . He never showed up. Was he always
like this?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Honey, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: This is what happens after a couple gets
divorced, the kid inherits all the problems. Not that I’m a kid. So how
are you, how do you feel? When can you go home?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I really am gonna do a little work. . . you
two catch up. . . and just flip these Hin like two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: You don’t want pancakes anymore?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I, uh, I don’t think I…I… gorgeous, next to
him No. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>int. bridgehampton general store - day</strong>: Erica, back
in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket. Marin ENTERS HER FRAME,
baseball cap, sunglasses, picking cherries.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I’m breaking up with Harry.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Why? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: ’Cause I met someone else.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: In the two days you’ve been gone?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: You know me, my life’s crazy. I meet a
thousand people everyday. Also, let’s face it, the guy’s insanely old
for me. I’d be nuts to keep this going.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: True, but you know he is….</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: – I know. He’s soulful when you don’t expect
it, right?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s unnerving.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Now, Mom, if you could handle this, I was
thinking… you and Harry…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I can’t handle it. Wouldn’t want to handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: But you’re only saying that ’cause you think
he and I have had sex.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes. Lower your voice. Haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Never even got close. Swear to God. Just
puttin’ that out there…‘cause for two people who are convinced they got
life beat, there’s was somethin’ cooking in the kitchen last night other
than pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s kitchen</strong>: Erica looks out her KITCHEN
WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far
to see them, she’s about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she
reaches for it and slips right Out Of Frame.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital corridor</strong>: Julian, in his scrubs, walks
quickly down a hallway of the</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: ER, on his CELL PHONE.</p>
<p><strong>ulian</strong>: I’ve waited a reasonable amount of hours
before calling you, even though you’ve been on my mind since I woke up
at 5:15. I’m wondering when we could have dinner again? I have to work
the next few nights and if we wait ’til next week, I know you’ll chicken
out so how’s Friday? I know it’s like a date night but I think that’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m kidding!</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Can you meet me at The Grill at eight?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay. Yes. That’s seems fine.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I look forward to, seeing you too.</p>
<p><strong>on julian - as he leans against a wall</strong>: turning off
the phone and grabbing his heart</p>
<p><strong>nt. erica’s kitchen</strong>: Marin ENTERS through the
kitchen door, looking almost a little dazed.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Okay, he’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Stop that. How’d he take it?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: He just took care of it for me; He was an
ace. Elegant. Said our fate was to be friends. …Oh my God. He was
breaking up with me. He’s a genius.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That’s impossible, he wouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: It doesn’t matter, we’re done and we both
feel good about it. I gotta get back. Now Erica, try to think of this as
the smartest thing you’ve ever done for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thought you’d like to know your daughter
broke up with me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Made up a story about meeting another guy.
Guess I wasn’t so cute with an IV in my arm.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, I think she really did meet someone
else.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, it’s alright. Her mother didn’t like me
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: How ’bout I bring you out some lunch and a
couple of blood</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: pressure pills?</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: You’re a great woman, Erica. Is this why my
doctor is falling in love with you?</p>
<p><strong>the beach - music over</strong>: Erica and Harry sit on a
blanket on a cloudy day having a picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a
story and she screams with laughter.</p>
<p><strong>brown stones in the sand - music continues</strong>: Erica
picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water’s edge. They talk
non-stop.</p>
<p><strong>a little later - lightning streaks the sky</strong>: Out of
nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their picnic things. The
blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it as Erica runs after a plate
spinning away in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - moments later</strong>: Erica and Harry,
wet from the rain, quickly shut all the doors and windows. Lightning
crackles across the sky and THE</p>
<p><strong>a match is struck</strong>: and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER
ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica turns and finds Harry just looking at her.
Before either of them has time to think, they kiss.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I just kissed you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, honey, I kissed you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know that one was me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Try not to keep score.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Soft lips…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m so glad they still work.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, well, now look who’s got</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: And you didn’t even take Via-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Kiss me before you make it go away.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he kisses him long and sweet.</p>
<p><strong>erica’s bed</strong>: They’re kissing on it. The rain pelts
against the windows as the sun goes down.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This could be world class interesting. Having
any doubts?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: But so far the kissing is spectacular. I’m
not grading you, just mentioning it. Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can’t get past your damn turtleneck. . .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Cut it off… Please.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
Beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What about birth control?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Menopause.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who’s the lucky boy…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I think we should take your blood
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s irresponsible not to.</p>
<p><strong>arry -’ a minute later</strong>: sprawled out on the bed.
Erica straddles him and whips the blood pressure cuff on his arm and
pumps it hard. Like a warm Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at
her, shaking his head…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nobody but you would. . .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah…so you’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!</p>
<p><strong>the blood pressure cuff - in slow motion</strong>: hurdles
recklessly into the air.</p>
<p><strong>ext. house - night - later</strong>: The rain is coming down
in torrents.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: We are CLOSE ON ERICA’S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN,
hanging off the side of the bed. She’s sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh my God, I do like sex.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You certainly do.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Wow. So this is what you’re supposed to do on
a rainy afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I really thought I was sorta closed for
business. Just never expected this.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nothin’s ever surprised me more…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is crazy. I can’t remember the last time
I cried. I think I’m overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Me too. That’s the perfect word.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
attack and I didn’t die!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s gotta be some kind of record.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Let’s not brag about this to our doctor,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey I may not be many things but one -
thing I am is a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Erica, Erica, Erica. You know I’m not good at
being monogamous, right?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Monogamous? Please, I hardly know you.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: ozy. Candles light the room. It’s still
raining.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: – So there I was at nineteen, in New York, by
myself, and I’d never seen snow before and I didn’t have enough money
for the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea how far it was and I’m
talking blizzard and I’m in sneakers.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Awwwww,. . .</p>
<p><strong>later - they’re lying on a chaise</strong>: in Erica’s room,
making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both look around for it. Erica
reaches for it on her desk.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hello? I mean…Hello. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mom, you guys okay out there?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: We’re fine. Why? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: What do you mean, it’s like a hurricane. The
news said the winds are like a zillion miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, that. Oh, no, we’re fine…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Are you having sex? Tell the truth. You are,
aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Absolutely not. No. That is not going on
now.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Oh my God, you already did it. Was it
amazing?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Just tell me, was it amazing?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes and thank you for the wonderful
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Am I interested in buying aluminum siding. .
.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Really? Marin’s selling aluminum siding?</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN
ISLAND, drinking wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan.
Candles light the room.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: –But why Paris?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I just always wanted to write a play that
ended there.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: People need romance like that. And if someone
like me doesn’t write it, where they gonna get it? Real life?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating eggs
by candlelight in our robes after…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So where do you like to eat in Paris? E</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar, it’s
just a little bistro on the Left Bank, best roast chicken in the
universe.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’d be fun to go to Paris with.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s a great city to stay up all night in.
When’s your birthday?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: February.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Mine’s in January. So, how ’bout if we still
know each other by then we go to Paris for our birthdays.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Maybe. . .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh. Sorry. You just… I have no idea how to do
this…be intimate but not…The color is draining from your face. Okay,
look, I’m gonna pee,take one of your blood pressure pills then when I
get back, let’s not talk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re the funniest girl I ever had sex
with.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That’s somethin’…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey… ?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think I’m gonna go back to my room…let you
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Let me sleep? Oh, right…you usually send the
girls home. . .but I am home… so…okay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m an old dog, you’ know.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hey, it’s perfectly. .. whatever. Good night.
This was..This was a great night. For me…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me too. At one point I even thought soul
mates, you know…</p>
<p><strong>harry flops onto his bed</strong>: stares straight up at the
ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s room - same time</strong>: Erica gets back in
her bed. She lies there for a second,securing her armor back in place.
She routinely moves to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and
shuts her eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in
the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’d like to try sleeping with you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. house - the following morning</strong>: The place is a
mess, the aftermath of the storm.</p>
<p><strong>hnt. erica’s bedroom - the same time</strong>: arry spoons
with Erica on her side of ’the bed, his arms snuggly around her. The
ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room is suddenly lit up and one of
Erica’s French CDs comes on full blast. Harry opens his eyes. He’s
surprised to see he has his arm around her. Erica awakens just as
surprised. In the light of day, a definite hint of embarrassment …</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can you see this?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Not really but it looks like it says
eleven.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It is eleven…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It can’t be, that would mean we slept eight
hours.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How ya doin’ Ace? Whoa Nelly…little
dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, just stay still, here’s the clicker.
You know you have a doctor’s appointmQnt in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’ll make us some coffee, get you your pills,
whip us up some french toast, I have ,the best maple syrup ever. ’</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Erica… You are a woman to love.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You are woman to love. What the hell does
that mean?</p>
<p><strong>an ekg machine</strong>: Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to
Julian at the end of the tape. Harry sits on an examining table in
JULIAN’S OFFICE, buttoning up his shirt.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Okay, buddy, I’m sending you home. These
past few days have done wonders for you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, I’ve been working on that stair thing.
I can do it by the way.</p>
<p><strong>ulian</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Climb a flight of stairs. Several times
actually.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Way to go. How’s Erica?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Erica?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I know you must know her name by now.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out is an
amazing woman. Does whatever she can to make me happy. Really. Turns out
she’s very giving.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Very giving.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Yeah, well that’s wonderful. I think she’s
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think she’s wonderful too.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Give her my best…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Julian. Thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: You’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What the…? This is the second time I’ve done
this now. I get overcome or something. . .</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: It’s very common to become emotional after
having an episode like you’ve had. Everything takes on a new
meaning.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So it’s not crazy for a man to do something
entirely out of character after having a heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Like crying?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah and totally changing their tastes. Like
suddenly really liking something they never thought they could
like…ever…and I’m talking really liking it. It’s…unnerving.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I think you can expect just about anything
right now. People have done some wild things after having a heart
attack…selling businesses, getting divorced, moving… Some people say it
saved their lives.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But most people go back to being themselves,
right? I’ll go back to being me, won’t I?</p>
<p><strong>ulian</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>erica - typing - her phone rings</strong>: She wears a blouse
with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in her life. She picks up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hey. What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He said you’re wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, really, what’d he say…How are you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He said I’m good..that I can go.</p>
<p><strong>. erica</strong>: Oh. So… Congratulations. That’s really. . .
great.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, he said… by tomorrow for absolute sure.
You think you can deal with me for one more night?</p>
<p><strong>a crowded club - southampton - that night</strong>: Packed
with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething sun burnt beach
crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest people in the room,
dancing with each other.</p>
<p><strong>a little ’later - the karaoke room</strong>: Harry leads
Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing Britney Spears’ Oops,
I Did It Again. When she finishes the crowd enthusiastically
applauds.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, here goes…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Here goes what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here goes me singing to you… Bought my own
music.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You knew they had karaoke?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Baby, it’s why we’re here. .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is for you, Ace… wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I wish you bluebirds in the spring… To Give
your heart a song to sing… And then a kiss, but more than this… I
wish</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t want to blow this part…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Et en juillet une limonade…Pour vous
refroidir dans quelque lefy glade…</p>
<p><strong>lowell - the next day</strong>: Packing the Trunk of the Town
Car in front of Erica’s house.</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s room - same time</strong>: Harry tosses his
pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters doing the worst job she’s ever
done of being strong.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Here you go, you can have these back now. I
confiscated them your first night here…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thank you darlin’ …</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Try not to smoke them… And I packed you a
sandwich, just in case your blood sugar got low. And some of that
iced-tea you like, and a nonfat, low cholesterol cookie. And a
peach.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: what a doll… Got something else?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Something to remember me by.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There is that…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: And hey, we’ll always have Paris.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, no words can ever express my gratitude
for taking me in and taking care of me and…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hey, your heart attack could be the best
thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I love ya.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I love you too…if that’s what you said. I
don’t know if it ends in ‘ya’ if it’s an official I love you but…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re not like anybody.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Neither are you.</p>
<p><strong>int. car - moving away from the house - day</strong>: Lowell
drives, rattling on about all the people who have been calling about
him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the house, until it is
finally out of view. Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich
and finds an Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn’t open it, places
it back in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s living room - same time - over, the phone
rings</strong>: The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: I knew you’d call.</p>
<p><strong>marin - walking in soho</strong>: on her cell phone,
CRYING.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Who? It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I had breakfast with Dad this morning and
we’re talking and he starts looking all weir~ and then he tells me he
met someone three weeks ago and it’s “really something and then he He
tells me he’s getting married. Why am I reacting this way? I’m almost
thirty years old… Yes, I’m crying, leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Who’s he marrying?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I don’t know. Some chick he met three weeks
ago. She’s four years older than me and she’s an Ear, Nose and Throat
Doctor. Has he lost his mind? I have a huge auction tonight… Why do I
have to be the one to deal with this? Can you please come in? I’m rea:~y
upset, my shrink’~ away for two weeks…I know you’re working but. .
.please. . ?</p>
<p><strong>an upper east side street - a little later</strong>: One of
those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen movie that makes
New York seem quaint. Harry’s Town Car pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS
PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry steps out in shades, holding an unlit cigar.
Lowell joins him as the Front Door opens and out pours his Two Leggy
Assistants and thumping Hip Hop Music. LOWELL Good to be back? HARRY
Let’s find out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. erica’s house - later</strong>: Camera quickly TRACKS
Erica down the front path and to her car. She’s on her cell.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hold on, I’m losing you. Okay, so you’ll let
Harry know I’ll be. in the city tonight and he can reach me on my
cell…if he wants… Okay? Aw shit. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ext. sotheby’s auction house - that night</strong>: A Crowd
files in for tonight’s auction.</p>
<p><strong>int. backstage dressing room - same time</strong>: A tearful
Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a proper dress and heels.
Erica leans on a table, listening.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: – Look, I get that he has a right to get
remarried, but he doesn’t even know her and she’s like my age. You know
what that’s like? It’s like beyond creepy. And I know he’s not replacing
me so why does it feel like he is? This is crazy, right? Crying like
this…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Honey, if he’s replacing anyone, it’s me. And
all the statistics say divorced men almost always remarry. That’s just
the way they’re built.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mom, you want to know the answer to the big
mystery of my life? Why I’m always with the wrong guy? This is why.
Because the wrong guy can’t do this to you. You have some control with
the wrong guy. This thing I’m feeling right now. This is my big
fear…that some guy could get me unglued like this, like nothing’s
connected. And this is just my father! I’m just not strong enough to
handle this kind of drama.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: The drama in life is what makes you
strong.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: No, it’s what makes you strong. You’ve never
really understood this,but we’re not all like you.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I’m sorry, if I were you and my ex husband,
the man who I still allow to direct my plays.! was getting married to
some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat Babe, I’d be bonkers. And look at
you. You’ve never looked better, by the way. My anti-depressant is
obviously not working. It should cover events like this shouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Since when do you take an antidepressant?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who
doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes. Me.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I rest my case.</p>
<p><strong>voice from outside</strong>: Marin, we’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mom, can you do one other really big thing
for me? Just say yes.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Anything bubee.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Will you come out to dinner tonight with me
and Dad and the fiance?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Absolutely not. No.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Please. He wants me to meet her and I can not
go alone. I already asked him if you could come and he said it was fine
and she said it was fine. Look, you’re gonna have to meet her too, so,
we might as well meet her together. Come on, you know you can handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>arin</strong>: Okay. That’s it. See that look on your face.
That’s the gene I didn’t get.</p>
<p><strong>int. sotheby’ s - moments later</strong>: Marin, now all
pulled together, stands at the podium in front of a packed house. If’
you didn’t know, you’d never guess.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Good evening and welcome to Sotheby’s and

<p><strong>on erica</strong>: in the back of the room, watching with
pride and worry. She slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone
lights up and tells her she has “0” Voice Mail.</p>
<p><strong>a clock on the wall - it’s 8:30</strong>: We are in ERICA’S
EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone is RINGING.</p>
<p><strong>angle - a cell phone</strong>: as A Man’s HAND turns it off.
We are:</p>
<p><strong>int. hampton’s restaurant</strong>: Julian sits at a table,
by himself, in a coat and tie, tucking away his phone. The Waiter
sympathetically approaches the table.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Guess I got stood up.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Would you like to order or…?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Why not, I put. on the tie and everything.
And can you bring me another. . .</p>
<p><strong>two dinner plates are carried through the
restaurant</strong>: and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:</p>
<p><strong>in a chic cafe in manhattan - later that night</strong>:
Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE’S FIANCE, KRISTEN, a
combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus and
drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and Erica. They
both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too fast. D</p>
<p><strong>ave</strong>: Thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’ve had a big week Dave, forgot how these
slip right down. I’m fine. So, Kristen, where’d you go to… –medical
school? Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I went to school in Philadelphia too.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Bryn Mawr girl.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: That’s amazing. My Mom went to Bryn Mawr .
. .</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Wow. So not only are you marrying my father
but our mothers went to the same college.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Anyone mind?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Actually I do.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Okay, I’ll just..have one. So, this isn’t
going badly so far is it? I mean for a totally surreal situation like
this.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Shall we order?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Erica, do I like duck?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes. It’s rabbit you hate. I’ll give you a
list of everything he likes and dislikes.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Let’s let her figure some things out on her
own.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I didn’t mean those things, Dave. She did go
to medical school.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Hey, not in front of the kids.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I will tell you this…Dave has one truly great
love in his life.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Really? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: His balls.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Okay, I forgot to mention she can’t drink hard
liquor. Why did you order her a Martini?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What? It’s not true? The man can not watch TV
or read without the hand down the pants– Here’s my advice after 21 years
I say who cares, they’re his balls,let him enjoy ’em.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I think I swallowed my olive, whole.</p>
<p><strong>a couple zigzagging around tables</strong>: and headed in her
direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by her date – no other than
Harry. Harry stops to shake someone’s hand, holds his date around the
waist. Suddenly, the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his
Date walk right by Erica’s table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.</p>
<p><strong>oving in on erica</strong>: as the room comes alive again.
Her eyes follow Harry as he is seated only one table away, his back to
Erica, his Date facing her. Marin hasn’t seen him. Erica tries her
hardest to act normal but apparently isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mom, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah, fine.</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: You know what? Maybe I need a little air…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hello… Harry. Hello…</p>
<p><strong>ext. restaurant</strong>: Erica rushes out. She’s a little
high and her heart is pounding. She heads down the street.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, God, I’m so stupid…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Slow down. You want to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Harry, I gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Erica, she’s just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind of a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, it’s just a dinner…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Look, Harry, here’s the problem. I really
like you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I really like you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah, but I love you like you. I do. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think maybe you should consider that you’re
in love with the idea of being in love.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: o you? Okay. Oh, God… I’m like the dumb girl who
doesn’t get it. I’ve never been the dumb girl before. It ain’t so
great.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s just calm down. This was just a a meal
with a friend.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: – Did you know I called you seven hours
ago?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was gonna call you. I’ve been jamming all
day, it’s my first day back.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Uh-huh. . .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I had these plans before I met you. But I do
like seeing you. I do. I’m always surprised by it.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What was I thinking?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Maybe you weren’t thinking for once and look
what a good time we had. Let’s not ruin something great.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Harry, I won’t be good at this.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: At what?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Acting like I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I have never lied to you. I have always told
you some version of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: The truth doesn’t have versions.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can you cut me a little slack? My life’s been
turned upside down.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah. Mine too.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Then let’s each get our bearings.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I don’t want my bearings. I’ve had my
bearings my whole fucking life. I felt something with you that… Oh, you
don’t want to-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes I do. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I felt something with you, I didn’t know
really existed. You know what that’s like after a twenty year marriage?
To feel something for another person that’s so off the charts, that -
Okay, not your problem. This is why I’m not good in relationships. You
know writers are like teachers, those who can - do, those who can’t -
write romantic comedies where THIS does not happen in the third act…and
it certainly does not happen to a 55 year old woman. In the play I’ll be
36 so it won’t be as pathetic. I’m just too old to feel crushed.I’ve
written this feeling but I never really got it. You know what this is?
This is heart broken. How’s that for impervious?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re killin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I just wish it had lasted more than a
week.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That’s a horrible thing to say. The life I
had before I met you. I knew how to do that, could do that forever. Now
look at me…what do I do with all this?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can we talk tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: What for? I saw your friend you were having
dinner with, if that’s what you want, it’s never going to work with me.
Look at me. I’m a middle aged woman, don’t let this brown hair fool you,
I don’t have a real brown hair on my head, I’m almost all grey…that
would freak you out, wouldn’t it? And I have. high cholesterol and my
back hurts every morning and I’m post menopausal and I have osteoperosis
and I’m sure arthritis is just around the corner and I know you’ve seen
my vericose veins. Let’s face it man, that’s not quite the buzz you’re
lookin’ for.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: And you know what? Everyday, I’m gettin’
older. ..just like you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just… the truth is… I don’t know how to be
a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That’s what you have to say after all this?
You don’t know how to be a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s not a small thing.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Are we done?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>harry - on a gurney</strong>: wheeled through the Emergency
Room of Beth Israel Hospital. This is not the Hamptons. This place is
crawling with patients. Harry’s delivered to a Latina Doctor in her
thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he’s taken off the gurney, he’s immediately
hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest pain, no
nauseau, some shortness of breath, was hospitalized a week ago with a
coronary thrombosis.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Hang a nitro drip.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can’t. I took Viagra.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martiinez</strong>: You have been through this before.
Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You h~ving chest pain right now?</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: No, and the pain I was having was sharp, not
like before.</p>
<p><strong>. dr. martinez</strong>: That’s good. Not like before is we
like to hear. Give him aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Based on what I see so far, your heart
is not in distress but I’m gonna do a rapid enzyme test to be sure. What
were you doing at the onset of the pain?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can a
woman give you chest pain?</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven’t
you heard?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, but so far, I’ve only given pain, I
never got any.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: All right, well you’re battin’ a
thousand here. Your enzymes look perfect, your EKG is normal and the
pain doesn’t sound like the kind of pain we worry about. I think what
you experienced was normal chest pain associated with stress.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Stress?</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: And incase you haven’t heard, that can
give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I donlt know what you’re up to
gallivanting out and about at this hour, but if you were my Dad, I’d
make sure you were home, in bed, recuperating.</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s townhouse - later</strong>: Harry slowly climbs
up the gorgeous staircase of his Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way
up, sits on a step, takes out his cell.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If you were my Dad…</p>
<p><strong>erica’s voice</strong>: Hi. It’s Erica. I’m not here so leave
a message.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>ulian’s voice</strong>: Erica, Hi, it’s Julian. It’s about
8:20, I’m in the restaurant…just Wondering if you’re…</p>
<p><strong>erica’s computer keyboard - night</strong>: A tear lands on
it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing Harry’s glasses, starts
writing at a breakneck pace, all the while, tears flood her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she
bursts into tears. While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While
she EATS BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she’s wailing.
Back at the “COMPUTER, she’s sobbing as her hands fly over the keys. An
actual boo hoo can be heard. At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes,
eating a bagel, wearing Harry’s glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,
FRENCH MUSIC plays in the BG. At this point, she doesn’t eVen” pay
attention to her tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere she
receives an INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY. He writes: Do I hear French
Music? Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s bedroom - same time</strong>: Harry sits up in
bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica’s glasses, a pair of pajamas
and a three day growth. A thermometer is propped in his mouth. He
writes: R U there? She answers: Yes. Hello. He writes: How are ya? She
writes: Great… as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve. e writes:How’s the
writing going? She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before
sending. rica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over. Then, on his
side, he receives: Actually just running out. Take care… Harry deletes
the I miss y… and instead writes: U 2. Erica slides down in her bed,
wiped.</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’ s bedroom - same time</strong>: Harry takes out
his thermometer. Feels lost. Looks at the clock. It’s 10:00 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>int. lowell’s bedroom - same time</strong>: Lowell lies in
bed in pj’s, WATCHING TV, smoking. Harry arrives at his doorway in his
pajamas. Lowell puts out his cigarette, fans the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Lowell, I’m goin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Okay. Don’t forget to put some clothes
on.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I mean, I should go out, shouldn’t I? Since
.when don’t I go out? Just cause some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to
stay in bed, doesn’t mean I have to turn into a monk.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Is there something you’d like me to do for
you, Mr. Langer?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, no, just…well, what are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Watching Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Would you hate making me something to
eat?</p>
<p><strong>reverse - harry and lowell</strong>: lying on top of the
covers in Lowell’s room, both eating bowls of pasta, watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Funny women are adorable, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I never really thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Neither had I, but think about it. Funny’s a
unique thing in a woman. It’s fun to be around.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: There’s some reason we’ve been watching
these two for 5O years.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Exactly. It lasts. We’re not sittin’ here
watchin’ Mamie Van Doren reruns.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No we’re not. You feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t think I’ve slept one night since I’ve
been home. Every little ache and pain scares the shitout of me…can’t get
a handle on my emotional life, don’t know what I want, don’t know if
what I felt was because I just had a heart attack or was real. Plus, I
feel needy. I never used that word in my life.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Lowell, have you ever seen me like this? Be
honest.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Nothing even close.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s right, buddy, I’m a mess. And I’m no
good at it. Those are very nice pajamas, by the way. Did they used to be
mine?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yes but you gave them to me, you said you
never wore them.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know. But why would I do that? They’re so
elegant. Nice piping…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Mr. Langer, you’re always giving away
beautiful things.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Awwwww… How did I get like this? I’m gonna
shut my eyes for a few minutes. Keep Lucy on…</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach - the hamptons - morning - music over</strong>:
Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks up a brown
stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the stone, makes an
`awwww’ face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the stone in the ocean, fed up
with hearing about him already. Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to
something.</p>
<p><strong>marin and her new boyfriend</strong>: frolicking on the
beach. He’s a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top, shorts, highlighted hair. Erica
rolls her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach stairs - dusk</strong>: Marin rushes down the
stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of the stairs, watching the
sunset.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Mom, we’re going into town…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Are you crying? I didn’t know you did
that.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah, it’s my new thing. I’ve gotten
abnormally great at it.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Is it Harry?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Seems I gotta learn how to do that love ’em
and leave ’em stuff.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Fucking men. You don’t care when I say fuck,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Not really. Sometimes. Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: So now you get my theory about love? You
gotta self protect. It’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Marin, that theory… how can I put this so
your feelings won’t get hurt. It’s just so crazy, it makes me want to
SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: And how would you put it if you wanted to
hurt my feelings?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Listen to me… you cannot hide from love for
the rest of your life because maybe it won’t work out and maybe you’ll
become unglued. That’s not a way to live.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: So you’re telling me you’re happy right now?
This is good what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No. This was bad. But for the three days it
was good, it was electrifying.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I think you must consider the possibility
that we are more alike than you realize. I let someone in and I had the
time of my life.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I’ve never had the time of my life.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know. And bubbee, I say this from the
deepest part of my heart. . … what the fuck are you waiting “for?</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s house - nyc - night</strong>: A PARTY is in
progress. It’s loud. The place is crawling with characters from the Hip
Hop world. Harry winds his way down his crowded STAIRCASE, Girls
grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard as he tries, he can’t quite
bring to life the guy he knew how to be.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: aving fun?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>ext. roadside farm stand - east hampton - day</strong>: Zoe
is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way. He glances up,
looks right past her, obviously doesn’t remember her, keeps on shopping.
Zoe thinks for a see, wondering how she can get his attention when he
looks right back at her, his face full of hope.</p>
<p><strong>int. erica’s dining room - later</strong>: Erica sets the
table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I got you something great at the farm
stand.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: These are for you to give me when you
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>int. dining room - later - music over</strong>: Candlelit.
Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a home cooked meal. The
CAMERA does a 360 around the table, their faces saying it all. The Women
bask in Julian’s warmth as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks
from Julian to Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen - later</strong>: Erica places coffee cups in
the sink. Julian is next to her, leaning against the counter, holding a
glass of wine.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Julian, I hope you know I’m mortified by my
behavior. I was going to get in touch with you, send you a note or
something…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: A note? That’s a little chilly.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m embarrassed. I just haven’t been myself
lately. What can I say?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Just tell me you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Then you could kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Kiss you?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You’ll forgive me if I kiss’ you?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Think so.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: No one on earth would forgive you for that
kiss May I?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>erica’s computer screen - another night</strong>: On it is
written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black as the music
continues to play. Erica sits back, still wearing Harry’s glasses.
Finished at last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right in the trash
can.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - moments later</strong>: Julian sits on the
sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of the play. A fire burns in the
fireplace. Erica approaches the back of the sofa, holding the rest of
the pages.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: It’s the best thing you’ve ever written.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: It’s wonderful. It’s sweet. It’s smart. It’s
funny.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: How great is it that I’m not intimidated by
your brilliance?</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Must we go through this every time? Come
here…</p>
<p><strong>a pretty girl - who looks a lot like marin</strong>: eating
lunch in Orso’s, talking non-stop.</p>
<p><strong>pretty girl</strong>: I’m totally excited about this
audition. It’s such a great part. It’s supporting but she’s a really
funny character. There’s this totally hilarious scene where she’s dating
this like chauvinist older guy and just as they’re about to do it, the
guy moans and she thinks he’s just really into her, right? Except he’s
having a heart attack and she’s like creeped out and her mother, who
basically despises the guy, rushes in, gives him CPR and saves his
life.</p>
<p><strong>reverse on harry</strong>: choking on his lunch.</p>
<p><strong>int. broadway theater - day</strong>: Auditions are in
progress. On stage, AN ACTRESS reads for the</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: part of “The Sister”.</p>
<p><strong>ctress</strong>: Look, we’re four sophisticated people. Why
can’t we all stay for the weekend?</p>
<p><strong>on erica’s profile</strong>: in the audience. She sits in a
row by herself, listening. Harry ENTERS HER FRAME, sitting directly
behind her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>backstage</strong>: Erica and Harry stand in front of a
BACKDROP OF THE BEACH.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So your play’s about us?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, it’s about me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Am I in it?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: A guy like you is in it but he’s not you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What happens to this guy who’s ..not me?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Haven’t totally decided. He can live or he
can die.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are you leaning towards?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Death. It’s funnier.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He dies of a funny heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He’s sort of a schmuck who screwed around
with our heroine, so it won’t be too sad.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Schmucks are people too you know. Death
doesn’t seem a little harsh?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I just went where the story took me. It’s a
work of fiction, Harry. Really…just stuff I made up.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Erica, we’re ready to do the
hospital, ’Do You Take Viagra scene… Should we wait for you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So I’m going to be the laughing stock of
Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Harry, he’s not you. He’s a version of the
truth of you. So to speak.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Sorry to interrupt again but Dave
wants to know, when Henry says, “I love ya”, you want that to be ‘Ya’,
not ‘You’, right?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: Well, you look really nice. You feeling all
right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know it isn’t like I wanted to stop
seeing you. We could’ve carried on a fun thing for awhile. Why is it you
dames want all or nothing?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I don’t know, we’re just goofy when it comes
to love… Look, Harry, if it’s all right with you, I’d like to be
friends</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not ready to be your friend. How’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Fine. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anyway, do you actually buy that horse shit..
.that men and women can be friends once they’ve had sex?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m friends with my ex-husband, but then
again, we didn’t just have sex.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We didn’t just have sex either.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Then what was it? Love to know.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it out?
This is perfect. I have given the `Can’t We Be friends’ speech for 40
years. I think I invented the ‘Can’t We Be Friends’ speech. But you know
what,now I get why they never went for it. You dames got one thing
right. Sometimes sex does change everything. Call me crazy, but I just
don’t see us out on the town, being pals, having dinner, ’cause I’d bet
you anything, at some point, one of us will have very unfriend like
thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass
the bread. You get what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You don’t want to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not “don’t”. Can’t. Can’t be friends. Doesn’t
work that way. Okay, I’m moving into another phase of this thing. I’m
mad at you. It almost feels good.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I think I’m mad at you too.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Excellent. ’Cause I don’t like thinking about
you so much and worrying about how you are and if I ruined your life
or…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: – You’ve worried about me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to die,
worries about you.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well, doll, I’m doing fine. So you don’t have
to work that shift anymore.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Erica, they want you to take a look
at the costumes for the dancing Henry’s. These gonna work for you?</p>
<p><strong>ext. theater - day</strong>: Harry FLIES OUT the Stage Door,
right into the street, is almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn’t seem to
care.</p>
<p><strong>ext. central park - day</strong>: Harry walks briskly through
the park, still pissed, his pace starting to get to him. He spots a
bench with a WOMAN JOGGER at one end. He parks himself at the other end
of the bench, out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: God is a woman, I know that now. No man would
punish me like this.</p>
<p><strong>woman jogger</strong>: You never change, do you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you know me or are you just talking to me
as “man” in general, the beast women love to hate.</p>
<p><strong>woman jogger</strong>: No, no, I know you Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh. Don’t tell me. I dated your daughter.
Right? I broke her heart then she married some hard working Joe on the
rebound, has three great kids. What is so funny?</p>
<p><strong>woman jogger</strong>: You dated me and you broke my heart
but after you I met the right guy. I’ve been married thirty-seven years,
have four kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the way.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I dated you. .? Did we. ever…?</p>
<p><strong>woman jogger</strong>: No…we did not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can you give me hint? A year? A decade?</p>
<p><strong>woman jogger</strong>: The sixties. You took me to Shea
Stadium.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: To a Mets game? I must’ve really liked
you.</p>
<p><strong>woman jogger</strong>: You took me to see The Beatles.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, God, I really liked you. You’re Sandra.
..Cook. We did. We saw The Beatles together. How the hell have you been?
What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Well, let’s see, after we stopped going out,
I went back to school, got my doctorate in marine biology, went around
the world a few times, met the man of my dreams at Oxford, married him,
we lived in London for 25 years. I wrote and taught, we raised 3 sons
and a daughter. I’ve just finished my ninth book and now I’m training
for my first marathon. Now, I must confess, I actually remember the very
last thing you ever said to me.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - day</strong>: Harry is wheeled through the ER
with the gurney. Dr. Martinez runs along with the gurney.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Mr. Langer… Back so soon.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is it, I’m dyin’, I’ve had 20 minutes of
severe chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, blood pressure’s gotta
be 170 over 100. Give me the nitrate, I didn’t take viagra. Plug me in
to the EKG, I need an aspirin, I’m taking 2 beta blockers, blood
thinner, Lipitor, Procardia and if I were you, I’d be pounding my chest.
Ow!</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: You’re a doctor, huh?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just a very sick man.</p>
<p><strong>close - the paper tape from harry’s ekg</strong>:
Dr. Martinez reads it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Mr. Langer, your diagnosis although
fascinating, was entirely incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Your realize a severe anxiety attack
can masquerade as a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So I’m nuts? Perfect! The one thing I’m not
taking pills for.</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: If you don’t want ,to end up in here
every week, I suggest you do whatever it takes to decompress. Try
something with me, okay? Close your eyes…now give yourself a visual
image of something that gives you a feeling of peace and serenity.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know. A hammock…</p>
<p><strong>dr. matinez</strong>: Okay, good…what else..?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Palm trees…clear blue water…</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Anybody there with you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. Beautiful women…in thongs…</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Okay. What else do you see, feel,
taste…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A margarita…a Cuban cigar. ..miles of soft
beach.. .</p>
<p><strong>dr. martinez</strong>: Keep going…you’re doing great…</p>
<p><strong>falling snow fills the frame</strong>: Boom down to see the
THEATER MARQUEE of Erica’s play on Broadway. On the Marquee are raves
from critics, ““, and a banner that brags,”Sold Out!“.</p>
<p><strong>int. apartment building corridor - early evening</strong>:
The elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an apartment
number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his throat. The door quickly
OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks relaxed and happy to see him.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I couldn’t believe you were calling from
downstairs. So great to see you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You couldn’t look better.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Thank you. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, no, I just wanted to stop by and say hi
and tell you I’m sorry if I ever did anything to you that wasn’t on the
up and up or…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: What do you mean? You were great to me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s refreshing. Good. Well, I don’t know
what you’ve done to yourself but you look absolutely radiant.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I’m three months pregnant, that might have
something to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>harry,</strong>: Really? Who’s ..the, lucky guy?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: My husband, hold on, he really wants to meet
you. Danny…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve heard so much about you…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I bet.. .</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, with Hthe play and all…</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: I’m famous,huh?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Just to us. In every interview my Mom does,
she always says she made you up.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So the guy in the play, he doesn’t make it,
does he?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He basically dies at the end of the second
act, but it’s very funny.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Was hopin’ she’d give me a reprieve, but…</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Yeah, well…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Okay…Best of luck, kids…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: She’s. . . Really good. Up to her old
tricks.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now if I wanted to see her…how would that go
over?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Only one way to find out, except she’s out of
town right now.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh yeah? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: Paris. She left two days ago, for her
birthday. But she’ll be back next week…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Paris…</p>
<p><strong>another elevator.opens</strong>: And a clean shaven, dapper
looking Harry steps off, cashmere coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS
HIM out of the elevator and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then
right onto THE STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS
AT NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE EIFFEL TOWER
POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high into the night sky
directly behind him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Showtirne.</p>
<p><strong>int. left bank bistro - night</strong>: Erica sits alone at a
table in the back of the room, drinking a glass of wine. She looks
vibrant. She glances up from her drink and sees what looks like Harry
making his way around the tables. She leans to the side for a better
look, to make sure it’s him. It is him and he’s corning right toward
her. Her stomach sinks, her mind races… and before she can come up with
a single thought that makes any sense – there he is.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I knew you’d be here.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ve come a long way to see you, Erica.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You mean we’re not bumping into each other..?
You came here to see me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, I did. I’m aware it was a bold move, one
of those impulses that grabs you,’ but…so far, we’re okay; right?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Well, uh, I mean, I’m just…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll take that as a ‘Yes’.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You want a glass of wine or something?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was just gonna give you a kiss hello.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, Okay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I remember you said if we still know each
other we should go to Paris for our birthdays, well, we still know each
other..”.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That’s true, but, Harry, I haven’t heard from
you in six months.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know but I’ve certainly been thinking about
you. There’s a lot I have to say. First thing is… I’m not mad at you
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Good, ’cause I’m not mad at you anymore
either.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s a relief…since I did come all the way
to France and everything. And… Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And congratulations on your amazing
success…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s been quite a ride. Funny, I thought
maybe I’d hear from you when it opened. Where’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: After I saw you in the theater that
afternoon, I had another “episode…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was actually okay, but I was sure I was
dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed to decompress. So I did. I
walked out of there and changed my life, sold most of my businesses,
packed my bags and moved to an island in the Caribbean.</p>
<p><strong>rica</strong>: That’s where you’ve been all this time? In the
Caribbean?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Actually…No.</p>
<p><strong>ext. caribbean beach - flashback</strong>: Harry lies on a
chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian shirt, shades. A steel
drum plays in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was there about ,six hours, when it
occurred to me that wasting away on an island in the Caribbean wasn’t
going to remotely cure what was ailing me.</p>
<p><strong>black screen</strong>: A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are
in HARRY’S CLOSET.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So I decided to take another kind of
pilgrimage…into my past.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My thought was – if I retraced my steps and
visited all the women I’ve dated…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: – maybe I could figure out how I got so
screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - harry’s pilgrimage</strong>: Harry STANDS at one
FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A lot of the women wouldn’t see me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Or speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But I was on a mission to save my soul.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My losing streak finally ended when I got one
to open up to me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hearing what they had to say was no
picnic.</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: But I stuck it out and I listened. Then I
listened harder.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And one of the things I realized was, I was
actually giving closure to generations of women.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Although I admit, some refused to give, no
matter what I did. . .</p>
<p><strong>close - diane sawyer</strong>: On the set of GOOD MORNING
AMERICA. She glances out the STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET
among the folks holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, “DIANE, YOU
WERE RIGHT. I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG. I`M SORRY.” She looks him straight in
the eye and gives ’him the finger.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: When you hear the same story about yourself
over and over, your life begins to make sense and the future becomes
your only salvation.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It took me six months to find them all. I
visited 18 different states but I came the furthest to see you.</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I should have told you he was coming, but I
was so engrossed in your story.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What story..?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, maybe another time. ..So… I guess I
should’ve seen your play, then I would’ve Jknown how this ended.</p>
<p><strong>ulian</strong>: Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are you doing
over here, man?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just a uh, vacation…never been to Paris in
January…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: It’s amazing to run into you. You look
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Haven’t been on a gurney in six months so
that’s somethin’…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Well, I’ve just been to every store in the
city, this woman is impossible to buy for… But I think I finally found
the right gift.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Happy Birthday baby.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’ll open it later…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, no, you know what, I’ll let you two
celebrate…</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Harry, stay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I can’t really.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: Why? You have somewhere to go?</p>
<p><strong>the waiter pouring the end of a wine bottle</strong>:
Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing the talking
as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying to be an approving part
of their romance but he’s totally faking it.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: – To the forces of destiny that brought us
together tonight.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: What are you doing, you don’t smoke?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m in Paris, the second hand smoke will kill
you anyway…</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: She’s very brilliant, but the woman can not
hold her liquor.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I like that about me.</p>
<p><strong>both guys</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Now, if I were writing this, this is where
I’d write, ‘an awkward moment’ .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, if you were writing this, I’d be
dead.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Never fails to amuse her.</p>
<p><strong>julian</strong>: No, Harry, please, let us…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, no, I insist. I crashed your party. At
least let me buy you dinner on your birthday… What time does that
say?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I have no idea…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait,’ I have my. . .</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Me too…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You think you look so handsome in mine?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You know how long I’ve been looking for
those?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>arry</strong>: Once again…closure. So it’s only 5 in the
afternoon in New York. What do they do around here for fun?</p>
<p><strong>int. noisy club - night</strong>: Camera finds the three of
them sitting at a small table. The place is dark, loud, crowded and
young. They’re all drinking champagne. The air is strained.</p>
<p><strong>both guys</strong>: Want to dance?</p>
<p><strong>angle - the dance floor</strong>: Erica and Julian – they’re
sexy together.</p>
<p><strong>angle - the table</strong>: Harry is gone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street - paris - night</strong>: Harry, with his collar
turned up against the cold, walks past the glass pyramid in front of The
Louvre.</p>
<p><strong>ext. pont neuf - paris - moments later</strong>: Harry walks
over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just making it all worse. He
stops, looks out at the Seine. He hears a classic French song in the
distance, then sees a small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him.
Without warning, a tear falls from his eye.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: At the end of the day, I’m nothin’ but a sap,
a stupid old sap, standing on a bridge in Paris, crying my eyes out.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look who gets to be the girl.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anything else… .</p>
<p><strong>erica’s voice</strong>: Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Where’s Julian?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He went back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He said when he saw me with you, he knew I
was still in love with you. What do you have to say about that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If it’s true, my life just got made.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Why’d you come here, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Because I realized what I was feeling for
you, have always felt for you, was something I didn’t understand, like a
language I didn’t speak… It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck away.
Turns out the heart attack was easy to get over. You were somethin’
else. And when I went to see all those women, I found out I was never
really present for any of them. And something inside me at some point,
had just…shut off. That’s when I think my heart gave out and you saved
me. I finally get what it’s all about. I’m 63 years old and I am in love
for the first time in my life. And that’s what I came here to say.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, this is the best birthday ever.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know I’m no spring chicken, I figure I only
got another 30-40 years in me. Tops. But how ’bout we figure out a way
to make this work.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay? Okay! I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, they’re playing our song.</p>
