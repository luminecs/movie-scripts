<p><strong>richard</strong>: You feeling better Franny?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes. I’m fine. It’s just this heat I
think.</p>
<p><strong>dinah washington</strong>: “I’LL CLOSE MY EYES… TO EVERYONE
BUT YOU… AND WHEN I DO… I’LL SEE YOU STANDING THERE…”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What station is this?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: It’s a Chicago station. I found it the
other day.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Kinda pretty. Is this uh… jazz kinda
singing?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t know. Can we turn it off? I have
such a headache.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Your mother isn’t feel well. I want you to
help her out tonight with dinner. Tell Michael to put this feed
away.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dad! You bought the wrong feed!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: So what are you going to do with the
prize money?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I don’t know. I might save up for one of
those hi-fi stereo players like Peggy has.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Are you seeing Betty tonight?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh! Frannie, is this yours?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You found it! I got my dress caught on
that damn gate. You must have eyes like a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: ’Bout 4:30.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well you should all go to bed early. I’ll
do the cleaning up.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Explain to me again why we didn’t do this
in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Mom’s orders.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Lawyer here?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I have some sandwich fixings if you’re
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my
brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how
interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The
last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He
ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I nearly died when we split the bill.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Michael doesn’t understand. People who make
the kind of money my brother makes don’t carry money on them. They keep
it all in various accounts.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Then we should have had lunch at the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Boy. It sure has been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We were here two Christmases ago.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, that’s a long time.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s not that long.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, why don’t I just say black so you can
say white! Don’t be surprised to find your brother hasn’t changed an
iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it’s in that tone! You
should have heard him at lunch – not two words until the bill came and
then he says, “Worth every penny.”</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: SO!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You said it in that tone! Like you were angry
at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I simply can not stand that tone!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Come inside. You’re just tired from the
trip.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not
knowing what I’ve done!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I’m sure you haven’t done anything. Have
some iced tea. How are the kids?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He dropped them off at Betty’s mom. Where’s
Steve?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: He’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Aw, is he still cheating on you, hon?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Just sign here as having received the
contents from the safe deposit box. And this one, which clears the bank
of all further responsibility fo0r the contents.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is kind of exciting. You think we’ll
find out your mother had secret millions lying around?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: All right. Why don’t we begin.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I thought everything WAS arranged.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, there’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What problem?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Your mother left explicit instructions that
she wished to be cremated.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Cremated?!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Eeeww!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I know. I don’t understand it either.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: When did she decide this?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Apparently just before her death.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, that’s crazy. I don’t know anybody
who gets cremated.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: My Jewish friend’s grandmother did.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought
cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: It clearly states in the will –</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t care what it says! Maybe Mama was
delirious, you know. She didn’t know what she was saying. If she wanted
to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Well, she was very specific. She wanted her
ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: WHAT!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How bizarre!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all
this?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a
Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me
years ago she died.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, I don’t care if it’s legal or not,
we’re not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we
can’t even go visit her because she’s going to be blown all over the
place like an ashtray.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not to mention people driving over her and
doggies doing their business –</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We’re not doing it! I’m not even sure it’s
Christian.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Maybe it’s an Italian thing. Their mother was
Italian.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Doesn’t matter. Move on.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Well, we’ll come back to that. Shall we open
the box?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Michael, look – I’ve never seen this
picture of mama. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: She’s not wearing a bra. This is Roseman
Bridge in case anyone’s interested.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s a beautiful picture of her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why are there two deeds here?</p>
<p><strong>layer</strong>: One of for the original parcel your father
bought and this one is for the additional acres he purchased in ’59.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Those are bills of sale from the equipment
your mother sold in ..</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh, just a old letter from a friend.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No treasure maps, huh?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Come here a minute.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What? Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Did she say anything in there about me?
Leaving me anything in particular?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I didn’t expect so. She never liked me. It’s
okay. I always knew. Thought we married too young. Nobody broke his arm
– that’s what I said but you know mothers and their sons. Also, she
never liked the fact of us moving to Florida although what’s where the
opportunities were. Couldn’t deny that. Suppose we should have visited
more but you know she hardly ever made an effort to come to Tampa. Not
even to see her grandchildren. She was a cold woman. They say Italians
are hot-blooded but not her. She was cool as ice. She leaves these to
anyone?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Um… we were just wondering how it might be
better if me and Carolyn went over the stuff by ourselves. Not keep you
two waiting around. I’ll contact your office about the legal work.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t mind waiting.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, there’s a lot of boring stuff to do.
Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama’s relatives addresses in
Italy – stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, I can help.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I said NO!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I do not need instructions from you to bathe!
I knew you’d do this! I knew I’d come all the way here and be shut out
as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn’t have to come! Lord knows I
was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive,
nothing’s changed.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Aw, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Carolyn – you want these candlesticks?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: No. You can have them.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Now what’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: “– going over and over in my mind every
detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself,”What
happened to me in Madison County?” I struggle to put it together in a
way that allows me to continue knowing we’re on separate roads. But then
I look through the lens of my camera, and you’re there. I start to write
an article and I find myself writing it to you. It’s clear to me now we
have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our
lives –</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Goddamn sonofabitch! I don’t want to hear
anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don’t want to hear it!
Throw it away!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s he saying now?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, he just gets on about how if mama
ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic
magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all
it says is… I love you… Robert.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Robert! Jesus! I’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: That would be some trick. He’s already
dead. That’s what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most
of his things to mama and requested…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on
Roseman Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn’t have thought
of that herself. It was some damn perverted… photographic mind
influencing her! When did the bastard die?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: ’82.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wait a minute! That was thirty years after
daddy. Do you think…?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I don’t know. I’m completely in the dark
here. That’s what I get for moving away.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This happened way before we both got
married. I… I can’t believe it. You think she had sex with him?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: My Lord. It must feel real nice living
inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t talk to me like that. She was my
mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was… She was a –!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Don’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, what am I supposed to think?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I can’t believe she never told me? We spoke
at least once a week. How could she do that?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How did she meet him? Did Dad know?
Anything else in that envelope?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: No, I don’t think so. I –</p>
<p><strong>carolyn/michael</strong>: You read it!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: “January, 1987. Dear Carolyn. I hope you’re
reading this with Michael. I’m sure he wouldn’t be able to read it by
himself and he’ll need some help understanding all this, especially the
parts about me having sex…”</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I can’t believe she’s making jokes.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Sshhh. “After going through the safety
deposit box, I’m sure you’ll find you’re way to this letter. It’s hard
to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of
me, I suppose. But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes
more and more important is to be known – known for all that you were
during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth
without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It’s
easy for a mother to love her children no matter what – it’s something
that just happens. I don’t know if it’s as simple for children. You’re
all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it
was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to
love me for all that I was…”</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Grateful!?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: “… It’s all there in the three notebooks.
Read them in order. If you don’t want to, I suppose that’s okay too. But
in that case I want you to know something – I never stopped loving your
father. He was a very good man. It’s just that my love for Robert was
different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out
before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe
more, ever experience…”</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This is crazy. She waits till she’s dead to
tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That’s
enough for me. I don’t have to know who she was.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, I’d like to read them.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. We’re going to lock this up and –</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: STOP IT! I want to read them! If you don’t
want to, then just leave. But don’t you push me around like I’m some
mule you paid for – I already GOT A HUSBAND!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: “I suppose his coming into my life was, in
many ways, prepared for weeks, maybe even months before. There was a
restlessness I feeling. Out of the blue and for no apparent reason.
There’s nothing more frightening to a woman whose been settled down for
almost twenty years than to suddenly feel unsettled. I don’t know when
it started … I do remember one night in particular, a little over a week
before Robert arrived…”</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “It was late at night after a long day.
Your father was tired – fighting all afternoon with that new equipment
Robert Harrison convinced him to buy. But I wasn’t tired. Lately, I
could hardly sleep more than two hours a night. I was reading some John
O’Hara novel, skimming the words, turning the pages without absorbing
what I was reading. My mind was far away. And no matter how I tried, I
couldn’t call it back.”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Later. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’m not tired. I thought I might finish
Carolyn’s skirt.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now?! It’s after eleven.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’m not sick, Richard. I’m just not
tired, now go back to sleep before you’re up for the whole night
too!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If you’re not sick, how can it be
contagious?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Damn it! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “Niccolo. I couldn’t remember the last
time I had seen that face. And then the memories wouldn’t stop. Like an
avalanche…”</p>
<p><strong>niccolo</strong>: Francesca! Francesca! Where the hell are
you going?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>niccolo</strong>: You play these games and I’m supposed to
follow – run after you like a schoolboy. Well, I’m not! I’m fed up!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: So that’s it! You just give up!</p>
<p><strong>niccolo</strong>: What “give up”? You agreed with them! Mommy
and Daddy said stay away from me and you said all right. What am I
supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Fight for me!</p>
<p><strong>niccolo</strong>: ENOUGH! You don’t know what you want! Stop
looking for me to tell you! STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “I had forgotten this. I had somehow
remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we
made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was
my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he
would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat
there… how many other things I’d forgotten.”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Frannie.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “The following week was the Illinos State
Fair. The two of you were going with dad to exhibit Carolyn’s prize
steer. It was the Sunday night you left. I know it sounds awful but I
couldn’t wait for you all to leave. You were going to be gone until
Friday. Four days… Just four days…”</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Michael, what did I tell you about that
door?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You excited about going, Carolyn?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Betty.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What’s she like?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Do you like her?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Uh… Yeah. Yeah. She’s real nice.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, what’s nice about her? Tell us!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, she’s… she’s real pretty and … and
she’s got a cute shape… she’s a good sport, ya know, for laughs and …
she loves fried chicken wings and beer.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Isn’t that nice? You should bring her
home to meet us!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We better get moving. You sure you don’t
want to come?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’m positive.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m going to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: It’s only four days.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we
took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They got heat in Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Not this kind of heat.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Heat is heat.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Heat is not heat! There’s different kinds!
And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and
call your brother and see if he don’t say the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ll get right on it.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Mrs. Delaney. Did you hear the latest?</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: No, what?</p>
<p><strong>gradys</strong>: Apparently, she caught them. Ran right into
them in Des Moines in the middle of her shopping.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Oh, what a horror. Poor woman. That
Redfield girl’s got no business showing her face in daylight.</p>
<p><strong>gradys</strong>: I don’t know how that tramp stands living
here. No one can bear even speaking to her. She has no friends.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, nobody put a gun to his head.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Oh, shut up! It’s the woman who’s in
control of these situations. Men don’t know which end is up till a woman
points.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. delaney</strong>: Just coffee, please.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: See. Money don’t buy happiness. I must say,
she’s taking it well.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: I’d kill him. Him and that Redfield woman.
Together. First one then the other. And then I’d laugh.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: I’d laugh first then I’d kill them. Make
sure they heard me laughing.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Francesca! So, everybody got off okay last
night?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: What you going to do all alone for four days
– a woman of leisure?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh, you know there’s always something to
be done. Have a good day. Henry.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: She’s changed.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: She used to be so friendly.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Maybe she’s going through “the changes.”</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: What do you know about “the changes”?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Well, I didn’t know they was a secret
club.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Don’t talk about what you don’t know.
Besides, she’s too young for “the changes.”</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: My niece had “the changes” when she was
thirty-one.</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: No. What a tragedy. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: She changed.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. delaney</strong>: Excuse me for a moment, I left
something in the car.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Poor woman.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true
Cary Grant has proposed to you?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes. And I’ve accepted.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What about his engagement to Dyan
Cannon?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I said to him Cary you’re being
ridiculous. You’re more than half her age. He said no one had ever been
that honest with him and he falls in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What about your husband?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’m very sad but Richard said that since
it’s Cary Grant, he completely understands. I’m also taking Mrs. Delaney
away from this town. She’ll be living with Cary and I in Beverly
Hills.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Sorry to bother you, but I’ve got a feeling
I’m lost.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Are you supposed to be in Iowa?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: :Well, you’re not that lost.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m looking for a covered bridge out this
way… uh… wait a minute –</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Roseman Bridge?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, you’re pretty close. It’s only
about two miles from here.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh, terrific. Which way?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, I can take you if you want.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Howdy, Francesca.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hey, Floyd.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: If I’m not taking you away from
anything.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. I was just going to have some iced
tea then split the atom, but that can wait. I just have to get my
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I wasn’t expect company. Let me get this out
of the way.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Out, then right.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Pretty country.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hmm-mmm.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: There’s a wonderful smell about Iowa – very
particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I can’t describe it. I think it’s from the
loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of… alive… No. No, that’s
not right. Can you smell it?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Maybe it’s because I live here.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That must be it. It’s a great smell.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Are you from Washington originally?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so
and then moved to Chicago when I got married.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh. When did you move back?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: After the divorce.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How long you been married?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Uh… uh… Umm… long time.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You don’t look like a native, if you don’t
mind my saying so.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, I don’t mind. I’m not from here. I
was born in Italy.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Well, from Italy to Iowa – that’s a story!
Whereabouts in Italy?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Small town on the Eastern side no one’s
ever heard of called Bari.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh yeah, Bari. I’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, really?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in
Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it
looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking
country.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You just… got off the train because it
looked pretty?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah. Excuse me a sec.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Like one?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: So, how long you’ve been living here?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Long. You just got off the train and
stayed without knowing anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: This won’t take long. I’m shooting tomorrow
morning. I just need to do some prep work.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t mind waiting.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Is it always this hot?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: This time of year.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Would you do me a favor and go to the truck?
Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners.
Would you grab me one?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh there you are.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh! You caught me.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Men sill give women flowers, don’t they? I
mean, as a sign of appreciation? I’m not that out of date, am I?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, not at all – except those are
poisonous.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: WHAT!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’m sorry. I was kidding.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t know what – I’m sorry.
Really. They’re lovely.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Are you by nature a sadistic person?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, I’m not. I don’t know why I said
that. I’ve been in a very… strange mood all day. I’ve never done
anything like that before. It’s… I’m just… Well, you know, the whole
world is just going nuts.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What with those riots in Los Angeles and
people burning draft cards and … Adlai Stevenson dying last month.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Shouldn’t let things get to you so much.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Looking for something in particular?
There’s not much of a selection.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I found this Chicago station before. Wait a
minute… Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Want another cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Well, thank you for all your help,
Mrs. Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Francesca.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Francesca. Robert.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Would you like some iced tea?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Lemon?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Would you like another one?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Mind if I smoke?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Sure you want to keep those in the
house?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’m so sorry about that. It was rude. I
think I just got nervous for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I thought it was funny.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Where are you staying while you’re
here?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: A little place with cabins. The
something-Motor Inn. I haven’t checked in yet.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: And how long are you here for?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No
more I don’t think. Where’s your family?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: My husband took the kids to the Illinos
State Fair. My daughter’s entering a prize steer.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh. How old?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: About a year and a half.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, your kids.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh. Michael’s 17 and Carolyn’s 16.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Must be nice having kids.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Not any more. It’s awful. They’re awful.
I can’t stand them.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Everything does. One of the laws of nature.
People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it’s
something you can count on happening, it’s actually a comfort. Not many
things you can count on for sure.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I guess. Except I’m one of the people it
frightens.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Italy to Iowa? I’d call that a change.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Richard was in the army. I met him while
I was living in Naples. I didn’t know where Iowa was. I only cared that
it was America. And of course, being with Richard.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What’s he like?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Franny, could you clean out my boil
again?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: He’s very… clean.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Clean?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. I mean yes, he’s clean but he’s also
other things. He’s a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle.
Good father.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: And clean.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes. Very clean.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: So you must like Oiwa, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: It’s… uh… uh…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Go ahead. I won’t tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: It’s… I… I hate it!</p>
<p><strong>(continues mos if</strong>: NEEDED)</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Much.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Is the dizziness gone?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I better go. You sure you’re all right? It’s
been a pleasure. Sincerely.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I feel so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can
tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you’d have made the front
page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your
butt.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: But I… We don’t even know each other.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You have no reason to feel ashamed. You
haven’t said anything you don’t have a right to. And if anybody tells
you different – you just send them to me.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Would you like to stay for dinner? There
aren’t many choices in town and … anyway, you’d have to eat alone. So
would I.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That’s very nice of you. I don’t get many
dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: This is ridiculous. Stupid!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m just going to put some of this film in
your fridge. Heat isn’t too forgiving out there.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Help cook?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Sure. Men cook. We don’t all eat bananas
with our feet, ya know.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: … No, wait, it gets better.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: She starts sniffing me.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh my God… You’re blushing.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s still a very sensitive memory for
me.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: We got engaged.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh you!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, it is. Except for the engagement part.
She wouldn’t have me, although I still get a Valentine every year.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You ought to write these stories
down.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Nah. I’ve tried. My writing’s too technical,
I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving
yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “Making pictures.” I like that. You
really love what you do, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m kind of obsessed by it, actually.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Why, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I don’t know if obsessions have reasons. I
think that’s why they’re obsessions.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You sound like an artist.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No. I wouldn’t say that. National Geographic
isn’t exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life
in focus and without any personal comment. I don’t mind really. I’m not
artist. I’d faced that a long time ago. It’s the course of being
well-adjusted. I’m too normal.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t think you’re normal.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I didn’t mean that the way it
sounded.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Well, let’s just call it a compliment and
move on. Did you love teaching?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: And did you?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I’d like to think so. I know one of them
went on to Medical school.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Why did you stop?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: My children. And Richard didn’t like my
working.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Do you miss it?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve never thought about
it… what was the most exciting place you’ve ever been to? Unless you’re
tired of talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’re asking a man if he’s too tired to
talk about himself? You don’t get out much, do you?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m sorry. That was…</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. It’s all right. I just meant, it
might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in
the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: This is your home. It’s not nowhere. And
it’s not dull.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Let’s see – my favorite place…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Get us closer!!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: My God. How I’d love to see that.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe
you can convince your husband.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, it’s kind of buggy out there.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman
taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You drink bug repellent?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, you rub it on you. I have some in the
truck. Don’t go away.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Smells like dirt.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You want to go back in?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. I’m all right. It’s working.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’ve got it all right here, you know. It’s
just as beautiful as any other place I’ve seen. God, it knocks me
out.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: This “… Of what I call God and fools can
Nature.” Who wrote that?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Umm, I don’t know. I can look it up.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’d appreciate it. I like knowing who I’m
stealing from. If you can’t create art I think the least you can do is
recognize it around you, don’t you think? There is… … so much
beauty.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Would you like some coffee? Or maybe,
some brandy?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How about both?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You sure you won’t let me help you with
those dishes?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. I’ll do them later.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Francesca?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Francesca?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: We’re not doing anything wrong, do you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He’s getting her drunk. That’s what
happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That’s why she couldn’t tell
us.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh, he did not. He’s such a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nice? He’s trying to sleep with somebody’s
wife.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I don’t think so. Not yet anyway. And
besides, something like that doesn’t make you a bad person. He reminds
me of Steve in a way. Steve’s weak, immoral and a liar but he’s still a
real nice guy. He just shouldn’t be married. At least not to me. You
getting hungry? I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I had no idea it’s gotten that bad,
sis.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh, don’t feel sorry for me. Please. No
one’s forcing me to stay.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Then why do you?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: And do what? Live alone? Go back to school?
Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? … What if I
can’t do any of those things?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Let’s go into town and get a bite. We’ll
take the books with us.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “We sat sipping brandy. I thought if
anybody walked through the door now there’d be no explaining it. But I
didn’t care. And I loved that I didn’t care. I almost wanted it to
happen. Then there’d be no turning back. I wanted to be like him. I
lived this life of his. We talked about his wife and I was jealous – not
of her – but of his leaving. His fearlessness. He knew what he wanted.
How did he do that.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Do you mind if I… ask you why you got
divorced?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Not at all. I wasn’t around much… So why did
I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a
home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I never got lost. For some reason, I’m more
at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I’ll think of myself
as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I’m kin
to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit
of not needing anyone, it’s kind of hard to break.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You must get lonely at times.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Never touch the stuff. I’ve got friends all
over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Woman friends, too?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m a loner, I’m not a monk.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You really don’t need anyone?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, I think I need everyone! I love people.
I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there
saying “This is mine.” or “She’s mine.” Too many lines have been drawn.
World’s breaking apart because of man’s weakness for some testosterone
conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over
what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares
him silly.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Why doesn’t it scare you?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I embrace Mystery. I don’t know what’s
coming. And I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Do you ever regret not having a
family?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Not everybody’s supposed to have a
family.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: But – how can you just live for what you
want? What about other people?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I told you, I love other people.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: But no one in particular.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No. But I love them just the same.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: But it’s not the same.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That’s not what you’re saying. I know it’s
not the same. What you’re saying is, it’s not as good. Or it’s not as
normal or proper.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, I’m just saying –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m a little sick of this American Family
Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you
think I’m just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without
a self-cleaning oven and home movie.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Just because someone chooses to settle
down and have a family doesn’t necessarily mean they’re hypnotized. Just
because I’ve never seen a gazelle stampede doesn’t mean I’m asleep in
the world.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Do you want to leave your husband?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: My mistake. I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What made you ask such a question?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I thought that’s what we were doing – asking
questions.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I thought we were just having a
conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings
I must be too simple to, uh… interpret or something.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I already apologized.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Listen, I’m sorry I –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was
an inappropriate thing to ask.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: … I feel like something’s been spoiled
now.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s been a perfect evening. Just the way it
is. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Richard, hi.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Fine. Everyone settled in okay?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Uh-uh… good… Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: … and then she tacks this note on the bridge
asking me to have dinner with her again!</p>
<p><strong>zulu</strong>: How pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Francesca?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes! Hi.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Am I interrupting anything?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. I was just… No.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t call sooner, but I just
read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I
had to get my shot.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: The light was fading. Huh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I would love to come for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Wonderful. Uh…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a
little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come
with me? If you’re interested…</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh, sure. Great.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’ll pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. I’ll drive myself. I have a few
errands. I’ll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Okay. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yeah. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Thelma told me he checked into the Motor Inn
and the bill goes to National Geographic Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: National Geographic? What the hell’s he
doing here? We ain’t got no naked pygmies to take pictures of.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: He’s taking pictures of the bridges.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Ain’t no pygmies there either.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: God. It’s Lucy Redfield.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Got room right here if you like.</p>
<p><strong>redfield woman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Hot out there today.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Well, are you ordering anything!?</p>
<p><strong>redfield woman</strong>: No. Thank you. I’ve changed my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>second waitress</strong>: I’d’ve thrown that water right in
her face.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Poor Mrs. Delaney.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: That all?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Isn’t it awful about poor Mrs. Delaney?</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Tragic is more like it. The pain that woman
has been subjected to by that no-good husband. I never liked him. Known
him for years. People say he’s quiet. Well, it’s the quiet ones that can
sneak up behind you and stab you in the back. I heard yesterday, that
she confronted him. Gave him the ultimatum and you know what he
did?–</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Ready. You have the keys?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: How about this one?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t bought a dress
for myself in so long. I mean, I’m just buying a dress. It’s not a
special occasion or anything. I’m just shopping. Just shopping for a new
dress, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: That might work. And if he’s still mad,
just tell him you could have done better but you married him out of
pity. That’s always works for me.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s Robert.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh, hi. Look, I’m running a little late,
but I’ll still…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Listen, don’t take this the wrong way but,
I’m wondering if this is such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I uh… I had lunch in town today. Happened to
cross paths with “that Redfield woman.” I apologize. I thought you were
half-joking about that.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh. I guess you got the whole story.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The cashier at the general store was very
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I think he’s running for town crier next
year.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I now know more about their affair than I
remember about my marriage. Francesca, the last thing I want to do is
put you in any kind of situation that would… even though we know it’s
just – I mean, it’s nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or…</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I understand. That’s very kind of
you.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I want you to come.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: All right. See you there.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Sorry I’m late. Richard called.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh, how is he?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Fine. They’re all having a good time. How
many more shots do you have?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Couple. Want to help?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, I have plumbing at my house.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Can I help?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Actually, no. I’ve got everything under
control. I’d like to clean up myself a bit. I’m going to take a bath.
Dinner’ll be ready in about a half hour.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How about if I set the table?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Would you like a beer for your bath?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes, that’d be nice.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Absolutely nothing. You’re just sort of a
knockout in that dress.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Table looks beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’re shaking. Are you cold?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Nobody’s asking you to.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m going to get some air.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Can I smoke here?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Are you comfortable? Do you… want to move to
the bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. I can’t. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You want to eat something?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Take me somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Right now. Tell me someplace you’ve been
– someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How about Italy?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How about Bari?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes. Tell me about the day you got off
the train.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Have you ever been to that station?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You know that little place nearby with the
striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Do you have anymore of the stew?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s okay. It’s not that hot anymore. Thanks
God.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I just feel like I’m getting a little …
out of control that’s all. It’s kind of frightening.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Why!? Because, I’m having thoughts I
hardly know what to do with. I… can’t seem to… stop them.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Nobody’s asking you to.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know
it!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I sat outside and had coffee.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Where? Near the doorway or the near the
front of the church?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Near the church.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I sat there once. It was hot. Like today.
I’d been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to
move every time the waiter came by…</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Can I get another cup of coffee,
please?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Bar across the street.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Have you called Betty? Maybe you
should.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember
the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Yeah. But I thought she died.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He remarried. Apparently they were having
an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a
stiff.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You mean – she didn’t like sex?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I bet mom could’ve helped her.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Boy. All these years I’ve resented not
living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I
could’ve moved back to Iowa… Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not yet. You want to go?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I think I better. Between the book and the
coffee, I’m this close to raping the busboy.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I used to love this place. I used to take
Kathy Reynolds down here.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You never dated Kathy Reynolds!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were
pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months,
I managed to catch her during her “exploring” stage.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I never knew that.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nobody did.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Was this during Betty?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Everything was during Betty. God we were so
young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I’ve never cheated
on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Did we want to?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Only about a thousand times. What do I do
now? “What’s good enough for mom is good enough for me?”</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What gets me is I’m 46 years old. I’ve been
in this crummy fucking marriage -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Carolyn!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: – for over twenty years because that’s what
I was taught – you stick with it! Normal people don’t get divorced. I
can’t remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely
that he transported me to Europe, for Christ’s sake – quite frankly, I
don’t think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my
mother was Anais Nin!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What about me! I feel really weird. Like
she cheated on me, not dad. Isn’t that sick? I don’t mean I wanted to
sleep with her or anything but – ya know – being the only son. You’re
sort of made to feel like you’re the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And
in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn’t need sex
anymore because she has you.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You’re right – that is sick.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: If she was so unhappy, why didn’t she
leave?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: She just made him perform oral sex on the
porch.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: “I’d never had a man make love to me that
way before.” Oh Jesus. “I couldn’t believe the feelings bursting inside
of me. As if I had opened some forbidden Pandora’s box.”</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “It seems, thinking about it now, that in
those few days I lived a completely different life as a completely
different woman. What was recognizable as me before Robert was gone. We
decided to spend Wednesday away from Winterset. Away from Madison
County. Away from pastures and bridges and people too familiar and
reminders too painful. We let the day take us where it wanted…”</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: On that one is beautiful. Look at their
expressions. As if the camera weren’t on them at all. As if they had no
strength left to hide what they were feeling.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: He’s a genius. They’re not photographs –
they’re stories, entire histories captured in moments.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I bet you could do a book.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No. I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Because I already tried once.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: But you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What were you like when you were
younger?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Trouble. Why?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I just wondered. Why were you
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I had a temper.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What were your parents like?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I can’t do this, honey.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram
it all in.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Excuse me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’re somewhere else, where?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Just that it’s been a perfect day and
that I’d like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Uh-huh. And?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You’re right, you know. We don’t have
much time.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Check, please.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: REBECCA! REBECCA!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: REBECCA!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh my God…!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I was paying the check. She ran outside. I
told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’ll check down here. Someone call the
police.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Think for a second. Is there someplace
she said she wanted to go?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I don’t remember!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: She was right outside. I turned my head for
a second.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: When was this?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: About an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: They’re not going to find her!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes, they are.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: REBECCA!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Where was she?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Across the street. She went into the park
and got turned around and didn’t know her way out.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You crossed the street by yourself?!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It was a green light.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I don’t know why I’m so tired all of a
sudden.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Long day. Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Am I too heavy for you?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Sleep all right?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you
don’t mind my asking, but I feel like I should.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, these… women friends of yours… all
over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you
forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I… What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, I just want to know the procedure.
I don’t want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Routine! I don’t have a routine. And if you
think that’s what this is -</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Well, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Well, why is that up to me? You’re the one
who’s married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: To do what? Be with someone who needs
everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point.
Would you pass the butter?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I was honest with you. I told you who I
was.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of
not needing and that it’s hard to break. I understand. Of course, in
that case, why sleep – you don’t need rest or for that matter eat, you
don’t need food.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Gee, I don’t know. I guess I’m not cut
out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the
same time.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How do you know what I experience?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I know you! What can this possibly mean
to anyone who doesn’t “need” meaning - “Who goes with the Mystery” – who
pretends he isn’t scared to death.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You have no idea what you’ve done to me,
do you? And after you leave, I’m going to have to wonder for the rest of
my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I’ll have
to wonder if you find yourself in some… housewife’s kitchen in Romania
if you’ll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and
secretly include me in that group.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What do you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t want you to say anything. I don’t
need you to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on
the linoleum one last time?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I told you! I won’t apologize for who I
am.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No one’s asking you to!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I won’t be made to feel like I’ve done
something wrong.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You won’t be made to feel! Period. You’ve
carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to
be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest
of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief
time you’ve touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn’t human not to
feel lonely – it isn’t human not to afraid! You’re a hypocrite and
you’re a phony!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I DON’T WANT TO NEED YOU!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: WHY?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: BECAUSE I CAN’T HAVE YOU!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: If I’ve done anything to make you think that
what’s happened between us is nothing new for me – is some routine –
then I do apologize.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: What makes it different, Robert?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Because… if I even think about tomorrow – if
I… even think about leaving here without you – I’m not sure I can… that
I -</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Oh God… what are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Behind the barn. I better go.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Madge?</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off
to town with the boy. I said - “Floyd, I’m going to visit my girlfriend
and spend the afternoon and that’s all there is to it. He said who’s
going to make lunch? I said I’m taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner.”
Isn’t that hilarious? He didn’t dare raise an eyebrow – I don’t even
want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for
nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days
pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me.
Have you heard from Richard? How’s the fair? God, it’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: … I said to her, “what’s the point of summer
school if all he’s going to do are these art projects. The boy needs so
much work in math and his spelling is a nightmare…</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Madge. Please. Something’s happened. I’ve
met someone. I’ve fallen in love in a way I’ve never thought could
happen my entire life. It’s our last day together. I feel like I’m going
to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: Oh, honey. I’m so sorry. But you’ve got to be
grateful for even feeling the little you’ve be given. Believe me. Go to
him. Don’t let him leave without these new precious hours you’ve got
left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: … without one lesson. The instructor couldn’t
believe it. So, who knows – she may have talent. How’s Carolyn doing?
What are her plans for next year?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t know. I woke up a little dizzy. I
didn’t sleep well. I think I need to lay down.</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: You want me to call the doctor?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, no. I just didn’t sleep well. I’m not
used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: No, of course not. I’ll just clean up.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, leave it. I’ll do it later. Listen,
maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I’m sure Richard’ll
have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.</p>
<p><strong>madge</strong>: Oh, that’ll be nice.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hold me.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Michael, get off the back of that chair!
What did I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: All you all right, honey. Let me see…</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Mama, look – look at the dress Aunt Patty
sent!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Franny, BONNAZA’s on!</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Francesca?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Would you like a beer?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Yes. I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Tell me why you’re not coming with me?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No matter how I keep turning it around in
my mind – it doesn’t seem like the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: For who?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: For anyone. They’ll never be able to live
through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn’t deserve
that. He hasn’t hurt anyone in his life.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Then he can move! People move!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: His family’s lived for almost a hundred
years. Richard doesn’t know how to live anywhere else. And the kids…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The kids are grown! They don’t need you
anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No, they don’t say much. But Carolyn’s
16. She’s just about to find out about all this for herself – she’s
going to fall in love, she’s going to try and figure out how to build a
life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What about us? What about me?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You’ve got to know deep down that the
minute we leave here. It’ll all change.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah. It could get better.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No matter how much distance we put
between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I’ll feel it
every minute we’re together. And I’ll blame loving you for how much it
hurts. And then even these four days won’t be anything more than
something sordid and… a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Francesca, listen to me. You think what’s
happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How
much we feel? We’re not even two separate people anymore. Some people
search their whole lives for it and wind up alone – most people don’t
even think it exists and you’re going to tell me that giving it up is
the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a
town you hate, in a house you don’t feel apart of anymore – you’re
telling me that’s the right thing to do!?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: We are the choices we’ve made,
Robert.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: TO HELL WITH YOU!</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Robert. Please. You don’t understand – no
one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children – in
one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of
details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so
that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of
details with them. And then you’re expected move again only you don’t
remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even
yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to
you.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: But now that you have it -</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I want to keep it forever. I want to love
you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don’t you understand – we’ll
lose it if we leave. I can’t make an entire life disappear to start a
new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not
lose loving you.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Don’t leave me. Don’t leave me alone.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I don’t know. Please…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m going to be here a few more days. I’ll
be at the Inn. We have some time. Let’s not say any more now.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: No. Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I CAN’T SAY GOODBYE YET! We’ll leave it for
now. We’re not saying goodbye. We’re not making any decision. Maybe
you’ll change your mind. Maybe we’ll accidentally run into each other
and … and you’ll change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Robert, if that happens, you’ll have to
decide. I won’t be able to.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Keep going. Please.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I forgot to take your picture.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: You all came home. And with you, my life
of details.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: A day or two past and with each thought
of him, a task would present itself like a life saver, pulling me
further and further away from those four days.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I was grateful. I felt safe.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Want anything special for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf
you make?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: For a moment, I didn’t know where I was.
And for a split second, the thought crossed my mind that he really
didn’t want me – that it was easy to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dad! You bought the wrong feed!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hi. I’m Francesca Johnson. I just feel
awful I haven’t come to visit sooner. I hope I’m not interrupting
anything. Is it too late?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No. Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I was wondering if… maybe you’d like some
company. I baked a cake!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Uh… sure. Please. Come in. I’ll make
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: “We became inseparable, Lucy and I. The
funny thing is, I didn’t tell her about Robert until years later. But,
for some reason, being with her somehow made me feel it was safe to
think about him. To continue loving him. The town loved talking about
the two of us but we didn’t care. And neither did your father. Which I
thought was a lovely thing. I received Robert’s letter and my photograph
soon after. I always wondered if your father found them. I was never
quite sure…”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, Franny, is this yours?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: I almost told him. In that moment I felt
as if I couldn’t hold it back. If he really loved me maybe he’d
understand.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Better?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Franny?</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I just want to say… I know you had your own
dreams. I’m sorry I couldn’t give them to you. I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: After your father died, I tried to get in
touch with Robert but found out he had left the National Geographic soon
after the Madison County. No one seemed to know where he was. My only
connections to him were the places we’d been to that one day. And so
each week, I’d re-visit them.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: And then one day, I received the letter
from his attorney, with a package.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: “There is a pleasure in the pathless woods…
There is a rapture on the lonely shore… There is society where none
intrudes… By the deep sea and music in its roar… I love not man the
less, but Nature more… From these our interviews, in which I steal… From
all I may be, or have been before… To mingle with the Universe and feel…
What I can ne’er express, yet cannot all conceal.”</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: There has not been a day since that I
have not thought of him. When he said we were no longer two people, he
was right.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: We were bound together as tightly as two
people can be. If it hadn’t been for him, I don’t think I would have
lasted on the farm all these years. Remember that dress of mine you
wanted, Carolyn – the one you said I never wore. Well, I know I was
silly. But to me, it was as if you were asking to wear my wedding dress
to go to the movies.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: After reading all this, I hope you can
now understand my burial request. It was not the ravings of some mad old
lady. I gave my life to my family. I wish to give Robert what is left of
me.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Hey, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You have been out all night long! Do I have a
right to ask where you’ve been or is this a family secret?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. No more secrets.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Hi, Steve? It’s me. Good. You?… Listen, we
have to talk… Well, how about you?… Uh, no – I’ve decided I’m going to
stay for a while… I don’t know how long… No, I won’t be coming back… I’m
not angry, Steve. I’m not angry at all.</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “I gave Lucy his photography book. If
you’re interested, take a look. If my words still leave something
unclear, perhaps his pictures can illuminate. After all, that’s what an
artist does best…”</p>
<p><strong>francesca</strong>: “I love you both with all my heart. Do
what you have to, to be happy in this life. There is so much
beauty.”</p>
