<p><strong>fourth draft</strong>: March 7, 1995</p>
<p><strong>a fist hits a face</strong>: The fist is in a boxing glove.
It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38. The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They
are in…</p>
<p><strong>in the ring</strong>: Hale and Deakins circle each other.
Hale is shaking cobwebs out of his head.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You know what happened there?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Hell, I barely know what day it is.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I set you up. I fake right, go left three
times in a row. You expect it again, I take the right in hard. That’s
what boxing’s all about. Make your opponent think you’re gonna do one
thing, then do another. Like Ali in Zaire, using the rope-a-dope on
Foreman. Everyone thought Ali’s arms were getting destroyed, when he was
really just letting Foreman tire himself out. Eighth round, Ali starts
hitting, George’s got nothing left – fight’s over.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: The fact that I can’t feel the left side of my
face – that’s okay, right? Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed
moment and suddenly launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.</p>
<p><strong>the other people in the gym</strong>: Take notice – the fight
is getting real. They move to the ring.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Several of Hale’s punches land. Deakins
staggers back, caught off guard. It looks like he might even go
down.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins
off. But he doesn’t. He drops his fist.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.</p>
<p><strong>the crowd</strong>: Loves it.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Now Deakins has the upperhand. He
backs Hale around the ring.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Don’t watch my hands – watch my shoulders.
That’s where the punch starts. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard in the
face, sending him back.</p>
<p><strong>the spectators</strong>: Are circling the ring, following the
fighters, cheering.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You were looking at my hands. Let’s try it
again. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard. He’s got Hale on the run.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Come on. Focus. Ready?</p>
<p>****: My shoulders. Ready? Deakins fakes left, puts everything into
one big uppercut. It connects.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the
corner of his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: He’s in silhouette, the lights above
him.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Deakins offers his hand. Hale
pushes it aside. Deakins ignores Hale, grabs him and helps him to his
feet. Deakins climbs out of the ring between the ropes. Hale grabs the
top rope and flips himself over, landing on his feet. Deakins gives Hale
a look, laughs, shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>hale’s locker</strong>: Is in sunlight. On the inside of his
locker door are pictures of exotic planes – the SR-71, a swept-wing
fighter, an artist’s rendition of the Aurora, etc.</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ locker</strong>: On the shady side of the room.
Nothing on the inside of his locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like
in its neatness.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>hale’s hand</strong>: Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the
bench.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I can’t take that.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Oh, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Really. I feel bad. How many times have we
fought and how many times have you won?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Jerk.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Well, if you insist. Deakins grins, folds
the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You know why I beat you?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Because you’ve been boxing for twenty years
and you’re much better at it than I am?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You don’t want it enough. You had me today.
I was back on my heels. But you didn’t close the door.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We were just sparring.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Life isn’t sparring, Hale.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I think I saw that on a T-shirt. Deakins pulls
out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No, that’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: If you weren’t giving it everything you’ve
got, then I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No, I mean – that’s yours, literally. I took
it out of your wallet when you were in the shower. Deakins laughs, puts
the money away.</p>
<p><strong>deakins/hale</strong>: General.</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Gentlemen.</p>
<p>****: Deak?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Sorry. What’s the mission, General?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Simulate a border penetration. Hug the
ground. Scare some cows. See if anyone can spot you.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: The usual …?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: No, actually, it’s a little unusual. You’re
carrying a couple of nukes tonight, fellas. Palmdale’s afraid low-level
gamma and x-ray diffusion might screw up the peripherals. They asked us
to send a couple on a run, see if anything glows.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: ’61s?</p>
<p><strong>boone</strong>: Big ones. ’83s.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Ooh. Crowpleasers.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Enter and walk under the plane,
nodding to the ground crew. Hale and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and
Hale climb up the airplane’s Crew Entry steps and disappear.</p>
<p><strong>intercut with bombs</strong>: Being loaded into the bomb
bays. When they’ve been clamped into place in the rotary bomb racks…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Ready for rollout.</p>
<p><strong>the ghost</strong>: An enormous black flying wing.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You know, these exercises are fantastic. I
mean, when that day comes and we finally go to war against Utah, we are
really going to kick ass.</p>
<p><strong>a park ranger truck</strong>: Drives up, stops. The driver’s
door open, and out gets…</p>
<p><strong>a ranger</strong>: We don’t see his face in the dark. He
switches on a flashlight, walks over and taps on the tent.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Park Ranger. I’d like to talk to somebody
about this fire.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wha–? Oh, hell.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: I’ll talk to him, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wanda, you stay put. Jim comes out of the tent,
the ranger’s light in his face.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know – no wood fires in the Park. It’s just –
Wanda’s got a cold and I wanted her to stay warm.</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Sir, you see any other hikers, campers
anywhere around here?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Not this time of year. What’s the fine for
something like this?</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Your life. Jim grins. But the ranger pulls
out a pistol and shoots Jim, who falls into the fire. He then puts three
shots through the wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger – call him
BAKER – pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>headlights</strong>: Come on and two Humvees roll in and four
men get out. Three of them – JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim,
and NOVACEK, a wiry guy in a baseball cap – start setting up what looks
to be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is…</p>
<p><strong>mr. pritchett</strong>: A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a
perpetually sour attitude. He looks like – and is – a lawyer.</p>
<p>****: Jesus. Do you think maybe you could get him out of the fire?
Unless you like that smell.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Weren’t you going to call Taylor today
about the Aurora Project?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Yeah. Turns out he wants people with more
fighter hours.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: What could I say?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Jesus. You are such a pussy. You never
fight for anything. Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Yeah, well you know what your problem is?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Because I said what your problem is, you’re
gonna–?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You fight too much. Right? You said it
yourself – you should be at least Wing Commander by now. Maybe you would
be if you didn’t insist on telling people what they’re doing wrong all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I’m usually right though, aren’t I? Hale
shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey, Wilkins, you old
bag of dirt, your boys in Utah still awake?</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Ready and waiting, Mr. Deakins. And tell
our favorite hotshot, he’s not gonna lose us tonight.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Wilkins says you won’t lose them
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly this puppy up
his ass without him knowing.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: head; into helmet</p>
<p>****: Hale says … if anyone can catch him it’d be you.</p>
<p><strong>cu radar screen</strong>: The Ghost makes a prominent blip on
the screen.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Everyone get a fix! They’re about to turn
out the lights!</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Ready, Major?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: On your word.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Go to war.</p>
<p><strong>close on control panel - three buttons</strong>: The left,
labeled TAKE OFF, is lighted. The other two buttons are MISSION and
LANDING. Hale pushes MISSION.</p>
<p><strong>the cockpit</strong>: everything goes quiet.</p>
<p><strong>cu radar screen</strong>: The Ghost’s blip disappears.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Lost ’em on active! Who’s still got
’em?</p>
<p><strong>ir crewman</strong>: Got their heat signature, sir.</p>
<p>****: Their engines may be cold, but the air is colder.</p>
<p><strong>cu computer screen</strong>: Half of the screen shows a
waveform, like a voiceprint. The other half shows a triangle moving
across a map of Colorado.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Descend to 400 feet AGL. River valley
approach.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach. Blue line
descent on throttle to 400 feet AGL. Hale pulls back on the throttle.
The plane descends.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Time to limbo down. How low can we go.</p>
<p><strong>a park ranger truck</strong>: Driving along the blacktop. The
driver is not Baker. It’s…</p>
<p><strong>terry carmichael</strong>: Pretty, late 20s. Her radio
squawks.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Terry? You been through the Needles entrance
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Mrs. Parker called –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, God. What is it this time? UFO abduction?
Ritual human sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: She said she saw a bunch of trucks going
through the Needles entrance an hour ago and thought they looked
suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yes, well, this is a woman who chopped off
one of her own fingers because it’d “turned on her.”</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Thing is, she said one of the trucks was
ours, and you’re the only one out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She was probably hallucinating, but I’ll
check it out.</p>
<p><strong>ir crewman</strong>: Lost ’em.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Stay on it. They’re gonna have to come up
for air sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: We’re under the radar. Proceed to primary
target. Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick – they’re on autopilot.
It’s a moment of peace. Hale looks out.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I tell people I became a pilot because I
wanted to fly cool planes. It’s also for this. When we’re up here, I
feel… closer … I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: To God? Is that what you’re going to say?
That you feel closer to God up here?</p>
<p>****: Hell, Hale, with the payload we’re carrying, we are God.
Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between the
screen and what he can see through the windshield.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Hale, take a look out your side. I think
our terrain following is off. It’s got us two klicks from the left flank
ridge. Hale turns to look out the window on his side.</p>
<p><strong>hale’s pov</strong>: Looking out the window. There’s some
movement in the reflection in the glass. QUICK PULL FOCUS to see,
distorted in the curve of the window, Deakins reaching inside his flight
suit.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Turns his head back toward Deakins.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Deak, you can’t smoke in here – But then Hale
sees it’s not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling out of his flight
suit. It’s shiny, metal. It’s…</p>
<p><strong>a gun</strong>: And Deakins levels it right at Hale’s head
and his finger starts to squeeze the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Grabs Deakins’ hand, pushing up as…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: The bullet cuts a line through the top of his
helmet, punching a hole in the window by his head.</p>
<p><strong>deakins and hale</strong>: Deakins goes for another shot, but
Hale grabs the gun and pushes up, sending bullets through the ceiling of
the plane, into the walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.</p>
<p><strong>the bullet</strong>: Tears through Hale’s harness, blowing
apart a shoulder strap.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Hale brings Deakins’ gun hand hard
against Hale’s own helmet. Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then
Hale sees something.</p>
<p><strong>the plane</strong>: Is banking towards a ridge-line cliff
wall.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Sees it, yanks on the stick.</p>
<p><strong>the plane</strong>: Banks hard away from the cliff, just
missing.</p>
<p><strong>armaments control buttons</strong>: Buttons include ONE, TWO,
LOCK, LEFT, RIGHT, OPEN, CLOSE, ARM and RELEASE. Deakins presses ONE and
TWO, then RIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No! He pulls at Deakins’ arms.</p>
<p><strong>cu computer screens</strong>: Graphics of bomb racks rotate,
the B-83 nukes – labeled and glowing red – move into the bottom spot.
The word RELEASE appears on the screen. Next to it, the word UNARMED
flashes.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Deakins hits Hale with the back of
his hand, knocking him back. Hale grabs Deakins’ helmet, yanks it off
his head and smashes Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament
buttons.</p>
<p><strong>cu computer screens</strong>: The nukes rotate out of the
release position. RELEASE and UNARMED disappear.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher,
swings it, getting Hale in the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood
running from his nose.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that there’s nothing
weird going on. No truck, no UFOs, and, except for the odd human head on
a stick, no sign of Satan. She feels it before she hears it or sees
it.</p>
<p><strong>the ghost</strong>: Rushes over Terry, no more than fifty
feet above the ground. The jet-wash rocks the truck, almost knocks Terry
down.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ hand</strong>: AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale’s
EJECTION HANDLE.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Hale tries to push the handle down
as Deakins pulls it up as…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Suddenly lets go of Hale’s hand, then hits
Hale hard under the chin with the fire extinguisher.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.</p>
<p><strong>hale’s ejection seat handle</strong>: Pop, hiss like a huge
vacuum-sealed can is being opened.</p>
<p><strong>hale’s pov</strong>: As he rockets up out of the cockpit.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: When the chute opens, he almost spills out
because of the severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds
on.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Somebody ejected!</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: They’re not due for another halfhour.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: This is Deakins! Hale lost it! I have to
punch out! Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He’s gone. He
hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth.</p>
<p><strong>cu radar screen</strong>: The Ghost’s blip suddenly
disappears from the screen. A chorus of “What the hell?” and
“Jesus.”</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: That’s not good.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant colonel sam rhodes</strong>: 40s, short grey hair:
he could snap your neck with a look. Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder
and Rhodes jumps into…</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: And it lifts up and flies off.</p>
<p><strong>in the sand</strong>: Something glints in the searchlights
but the helicopter moves on.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Hold it. Come back. The lights sweep back,
find…</p>
<p><strong>the tip of black wing</strong>: Sticking out of the sand.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Enters. Baird, 60s, is the White House Chief
of Staff. His assistant stays in the b.g. as Baird walks in.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: So, do I wake the President?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Where is he – Las Vegas?</p>
<p>****: Computer convention. Some information superhighway crap.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Let him sleep for now. We’re going out
with this. Rick’s team prepared it. The chairman nods toward RICK. Baird
reads, mumbling.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: “United States Air Force … regrets to
announce … C-130 heavy-lift cargo plane … down over the Utah desert …
status of crew not determined at this time … yadda yadda … Nice
bullshit, Rick. Baird hands it to Rick, who starts for the door.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: That’s a mistake. The room quiets. All eyes
on…</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Baird’s intensely competent assistant.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Giles …?</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Aviation Week has been following this plane’s
development for years. They have stringers who spend their vacations
sitting in lawnchairs all night long by the Whiteman perimeter fence
just in case one of these things takes off. The boys in those lawnchairs
know one took off tonight. They’re going to know when it doesn’t come
back.</p>
<p>****: We might as well tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: The truth? How the hell did you get this job?
A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman – well? The
Chairman thinks for a second, nods. Baird turns to Rick.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Rewrite it. What Giles just said. Rick grits
his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: I want you in Utah. Now. Giles nods, heads
out. Baird grabs his arm.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: You scare me sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare myself. And out
Giles goes.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Cockpit’s empty! We’re checking the
payload!</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Watch your needles!</p>
<p><strong>inside bomb bays</strong>: Rhodes’ light plays over the bomb
racks – empty.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Colonel? We’ve got ourselves a Broken
Arrow.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Broken Arrow?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: That’s what we call it when we lose a
nuclear weapon.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Oh, Jesus. I don’t know what’s scarier –
losing nuclear weapons or the fact that it happens so often that you
people have a term for it.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Find the nukes, Sam. But be careful. I know
they say those eggs can’t be cracked, but if your geigers pick up more
rads than you’d get off a toaster, I want you out of there. Wilkins to
the CORPORAL.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Get the teams in. I want Colonel Rhodes and
his men backed up.</p>
<p><strong>cu computer screen</strong>: Various views of a B-83 nuclear
weapon. Creeley is briefing Baird on the nukes.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: They dropped from a plane but they didn’t go
off…?</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: They have to be armed to detonate.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Then they’re destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: They’re designed to survive crashes intact.
They can lie in a pool of burning jet fuel for five hours without any
problem.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: How did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: In his last transmission, Colonel Deakins
said Major Hale lost control. He probably hit weapons release by
accident. Believe me, when a plane’s auguring in, you start pushing
every button you can. Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes
his head.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Hell, we should take the cost of the plane
out of major Hale’s salary. Although I guess at two billion dollars a
pop, that could take a while.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks
his arm about to punch. He hesitates when he sees it’s…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She seizes Hale’s hesitation and punches him
hard.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get
up, reaching for her gun. Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in
the gut, sending her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her
gun. Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Jarring, racing over rock and then…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.</p>
<p><strong>hale’s pov</strong>: He’s stopped right at the edge of a
fifty foot drop.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That would be the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale,
pistol out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p>****: Look, I –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Gimme your hands. Hale sticks his hands
behind him. Terry handcuffs them.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m going to tell you something I can’t tell
you. Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching him
off.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: There were nuclear weapons on that plane. The
guy I was flying with is trying to steal them. Terry reacts to that, but
keeps Hale moving.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I have to stop him, and I need your help.</p>
<p>****: Look, pal, all I know is, I saw you come down, I come in to
help you and you grab me, kick me and run away.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I only ran because you punched me.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What, we’re ten years old now? “You started
it. No you started it.”</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: He has men on the ground. I –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Save it. My dog’s waiting for his breakfast.
Terry starts to push Hale along again and…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Jumps up and through the handcuffs.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Reaches for her revolver, but…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but
not before…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under
Hale’s chin.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Don’t move. A beat while they catch
their breath.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: This isn’t a stand-off, okay? I’ve got a
gun.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, well, I never keep my gun loaded. Terry
taps her belt.</p>
<p><strong>close on her belt</strong>: A line of bullets.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets
the revolver swing down on his finger. Just as Terry takes it…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Moves fast, grabs Terry’s knife hand, then
kicks her legs out from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still
holding her knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m telling you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: This is a good way to convince me.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I could kill you now. Right? Terry nods,
bewildered and more than a little scared. Hale lets go of Terry’s hand
holding the knife.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I need your help. Terry looks at Hale for a
long moment. She’s still holding the knife. She exhales, then sticks the
knife in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>on the device’s screen</strong>: Green, like a radar screen.
It’s blank, and then two dots appear on the outer edge of the
screen.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Got ’em!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ve got a radio in the truck. We can call
McMurran and get the Marines in here.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Deakins’ll be monitoring any radio
transmissions out of here. That’s what I’d do.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: horrible betrayal he</p>
<p>****: Someone I would’ve trusted with my life.</p>
<p>****: You’ve gotta get to a phone.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Me? What are you going to do?</p>
<p>****: Wait. You’re gonna go after this guy? Isn’t he going to have a
lot guns and shit? I don’t want to sound insulting or anything, but …
you’re just a pilot.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I don’t have any choice. The nukes are my
responsibility. Besides…</p>
<p>****: I do have one thing going for me.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What’s that? Hale sticks…</p>
<p><strong>a twenty dollar bill</strong>: Under a rock.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: The last thing in the world he expects is for
me to come after him. Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun.
Terry looks at the $20 bill.</p>
<p><strong>down in the crevice</strong>: Rhodes comes down the last few
feet of rope to the bottom of the crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are
waiting, shining lights on a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one
piece.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: We’ve got one intact. Let’s go find the
other one. Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice.</p>
<p><strong>a humvee</strong>: climbs up the slope toward the
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: Grabs his rifle, hops out of the
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>novacek and lett</strong>: Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks
his head out.</p>
<p><strong>novacek</strong>: Hey, you guys need any help?</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: It’s an Air Force training exercise, sir.
I’m going to have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>novacek</strong>: Hey, no problem. We just –</p>
<p><strong>lett</strong>: Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots.</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: Barely has time to raise his rifle before
he’s hit. He drops.</p>
<p><strong>another humvee</strong>: Drives up fast.</p>
<p><strong>baker, johnson and pritchett</strong>: Get out. Johnson wears
radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.</p>
<p><strong>novacek</strong>: Picks up McKellar’s half-eaten candy bar,
takes a bite.</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: Any sign of Deakins? Novacek, mouth full,
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: He better be dead.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Pritchett.
They all look over to see…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Walk out of the shadows, smoking a
cigarette. While soldierly with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite
with Pritchett.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You said nothing would go wrong!</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Well, point of fact, nothing has.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You didn’t drop the nukes where you were
supposed to!</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Ah, but we always planned on the search and
rescue team finding the weapons for us, and they have. Mr. Pritchett, I
really have thought of everything. Johnson walks up, pointing to his
radio headgear.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Newsflash. Two gunships just left from
McMurran and they’re headed this way.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You thought of that?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: That’ll take care of itself.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: What about the other pilot? We saw him
eject.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You don’t have to worry about Major Hale.
He’s probably hiding behind a rock somewhere, praying I don’t find
him.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Someone else might find him. A Ranger
called her base, said she saw a pilot come down and was gonna go look
for him. Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Get ready. You’ll go when the clean-up’s
done. Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter. Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail
Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry’s truck.
Terry taken a look at Hale’s ripped and torn flightsuit.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is that the new uniform?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Yeah. Less constricting.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The dayshift guy left some work clothes in
the truck. You can have them if you want. Hale nods. His feet crunch on
something.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Don’t walk there.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Don’t walk where?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: On that black stuff. That’s cryptogamic soil.
It’s very fragile. One footprint takes centuries to repair.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: That’s a new one. Endangered dirt. Terry gives
Hale a look.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Hello? McMurran? Come in. Suddenly, there’s
a soft popping sound and Reed drops.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Reed? What the –? Rhodes looks down, sees
blood on Reed. Before he can say another word, there’s a fusillade of
soft popping sounds as silenced bullets ricochet off the rock around
them. Thomas goes down.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam?</p>
<p><strong>the red laser bean</strong>: Dances along the wall, heading
for them.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Raises his pistol and shoots at the source
of the laser.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett and deakins</strong>: Pritchett looks at Deakins –
another part of the plan? Deakins is unperturbed. He’s holding an
overnight bag. He unzips it.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: We’ll open up the access panels, put in a
couple grenades. The nukes won’t go nuclear, but they will go dirty. I
won’t lie and say we’ll be all right. We won’t. But if we’re gonna go,
might as well take those bastards with us. Rhodes scrambles off.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Just one thing, sir.</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: This. Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes
is thrown back, dead. Kelly yells up top.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Done! Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast.</p>
<p><strong>the twenty dollar bill</strong>: From his flightsuit and puts
it into his shirt pocket.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Climbs into view.</p>
<p>****: Colonel Wilkins? You there?</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: It’s Lieutenant Kelly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: What happened, Kelly?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir! They’re all
dead!</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: What happened? Deakins puts the shaver to
the radio mike. There’s a wash of 40 static. Deakins pulls the shaver
away, nods to Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: It’s the nuke, sir! It’s open! Wide open! Oh,
God, what am I going to do?! Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again –
more static. He reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK
switch, then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Call back the teams and get me the Room.
We’re gonna need NEST in here.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Brought a tear to my eye.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I’d just like to thank the members of the
Academy.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I hope you’ve got another surprise up
your sleeve. If I’m not mistaken, there are two attack helicopters
headed this way.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Not any longer. They look at him; he taps
his radio headgear.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: They’ve just been recalled.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think they’ve
got an exposed core. They’ll want to get a satellite to take a look, but
it’ll take ninety minutes minimum to shift the orbit. Until then? Well,
people get a little weird when it comes to radiation. No one’ll have the
balls to come near here unless it’s NEST – the Nuclear Emergency Search
Teams –and it’ll take the nearest team at least two hours to get out
here, and we only need an hour to reach our connection with the
transport squad.</p>
<p>****: Not that I’m not delighted with your presence, but you really
don’t need to be here.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: What’s your dog’s name?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Bear. I was going to call him Death, so I
could say things like, “I walk with Death,” and “Death chewed my boots,”
but I chickened out. You?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No dog.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do you have a name, or is that classified?
Before Hale can answer…</p>
<p><strong>the search and rescue helicopter</strong>: Rises up in front
of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a button and machine guns on
the sides open up.</p>
<p><strong>terry and hale</strong>: Terry jumps on the brakes. She and
Hale bail out as…</p>
<p><strong>the truck</strong>: is riddled with bullets and explodes.</p>
<p><strong>terry and hale</strong>: Sprint up the trail.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We’ve gotta hide!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Follow me! Terry leads Hale up a short slope.
Hale scrambles over the top and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open
expanse – no cover.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Hide where?</p>
<p><strong>in the helicopter</strong>: Novacek grins, shoots.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle
in. When he turns back, Terry’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: What the –?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on! Hale runs in the direction of her
voice.</p>
<p><strong>novacek’s pov</strong>: Aiming at Hale’s back. But then Hale
suddenly drops from view.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep
sand.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: This way. Terry runs. Hale follows.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: How do you –?</p>
<p>****: I’m a Ranger. I’ve been over these trails a million times. Not
looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head and drops like
a rock.</p>
<p><strong>in the helicopter</strong>: Novacek can’t see his prey. He
gets an idea and reaches back.</p>
<p><strong>terry and hale</strong>: Terry is trying to get her eyes to
focus.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Please don’t tell anyone I did that.</p>
<p><strong>in the helicopter</strong>: Novacek has a box of grenades
beside him. He pulls the pin on a grenade and drops it.</p>
<p><strong>terry and hale</strong>: Hale is helping Terry to her feet as
BOOM – the first grenade goes off. They run.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! –
a grenade goes off in front of them. They run back. They’re cornered.
Hale looks around, looks up.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Can you climb up?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah …?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Give me your gun.</p>
<p><strong>top of cliff</strong>: Terry climbs up into view of…</p>
<p><strong>novacek</strong>: Who sees her.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Pull herself up, stands, hands up.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Novacek swivels the helicopter
around.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: This has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p><strong>novacek</strong>: Tell me where he is!</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver
straight up at the helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out
where to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Blackhawk … Moved pilot seat back a foot …
Puts him right about … here. Hale hesitates – he’s never shot at someone
before – then takes a breath and starts shooting.</p>
<p><strong>in the helicopter</strong>: The bullets fly up from below.
One hits Novacek. He slumps, pushing the joystick to one side.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Starts to lean over sideways.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Is surprised – it worked!’</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Watches in horror as…</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter’s main rotor blades</strong>: Angle toward
her, slicing the air as the helicopter tips over.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff
as…</p>
<p><strong>the rotor blades</strong>: Hit the rock, sparking, grinding,
right over Terry’s head. The blades stop dead. But the torque of the
motor brings…</p>
<p><strong>the tail of the helicopter</strong>: Up and over, in a high
arc.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Looks up.</p>
<p><strong>the tail –section</strong>: Is swinging over fast and the
tail rotor is coming right for her.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her
to her feet as…</p>
<p><strong>the tail section</strong>: Swings down, rotor spinning. It
digs into the dirt and sand a split-second after…</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Run clear.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: We don’t have to worry about the other
pilot? Deakins shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Then how come the helicopter crashed?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Pilot error. Deakins turns and walks away,
over to…</p>
<p><strong>baker and kelly</strong>: Who have taken the three-foot,
pointed, front section off each nuke. They are loading them into the
back of one Humvee. Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still
nagging.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Tell me again how I don’t need to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Mr. Pritchett, I understand your concerns.
You and your associates gave me a lot of money to mount this operation.
But they’re getting ten times that back if we succeed.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: If we succeed?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: All I can do is my part. We’ve got the
weapons, we’re … … seventeen minutes ahead of schedule and everything
will be in place within two hours. But I can’t guarantee that the
assholes in Washington won’t do something stupid like not pay.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: What if they don’t?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Then the next census for this region is
going to show a very sudden drop in population.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Colonel Wilkins? I’m Giles Prentice. My word
from your search and rescue team?</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: I’m sorry. Picked up any radiation? Wilkins
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: That’s kind of strange – if there’s an
exposed core out there.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Point?</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Probably nothing. I asked for a transcript of
the last cockpit transmission…? Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands
some papers to Giles. Giles reads them quickly.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: I don’t know what you expect to find.</p>
<p><strong>cu transcripts</strong>: We see COLONEL DEAKINS: “This is
Deakins! Hale lost it! Oh, God! I have to punch out!”</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: You know these guys? The pilots?</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Just on the radio. Never met ’em. Why?</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: What if this wasn’t pilot error?</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: No rhetorical questions, Giles. Spit it
out.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: In the last transmission from the plane,
Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost it and made the plane crash. We all
assumed that meant pilot error. But what if Deakins meant Hale made the
plane crash. Murmurs of “That’s insane” “No way” fill the room.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Why would he do that?</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Two nuclear weapons would be worth a hell of
a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: To whom? Son, there are easier ways for
someone to buy nuclear weapons. You go to one of the old Soviet
republics, you can get one for the price of a BMW.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: I meant they’d be worth a lot of money to us.
How much would we pay to get them back? To make sure they weren’t used
in this country? A flurry of looks around the room.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Hold on, hold on. These nukes have codes or
something that prevent people from using them.</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: No one has these codes – outside of the
President and you guys.</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: Access to the codes requires the highest
security –</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: I mean, not even the pilots have these codes,
right?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Where’s that NEST team now?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: They just took off.</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: Listen up, sportsfans. Word is, this
particular broken arrow has broken open. Our ETA Utah is ninety-six
minutes. I want everyone to take that time to triple-check the seams and
seals on their E-suits. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: You think I’m nuts. You don’t think NEST or
the satellite will find anything weird.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p>****: But it wouldn’t hurt to get some gunships fueled just in case.
Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: How do they get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Get out? I don’t think that helicopter’s
going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Deak’d have a back-up. He’d be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: If they’ve got trucks they could take the
four-wheel-drive trail we were on.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: He wouldn’t want to go towards town.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: He could go to the river. Hale looks at Terry
– that’s exactly what Deakins would do.</p>
<p><strong>in the second humvee</strong>: Kelly drives, Deakins beside
him, Johnson and Pritchett in back.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I think it’s barbaric.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Me, too! I love it! Two men trying to do as
much damage to the other as he can. As basic as you can get, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I think it should be banned.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: So do I! God, wouldn’t that make it more
exciting? Having to go into dark alleys and basements to see a fight? I
bet we see eye-to- eye on a lot of things, Mr. Pritchett. Deakins grins;
Mr. Pritchett steams.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: The two Humvees make their way along the
trail.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: See the one in front? It just has a driver?
They wanted to keep the weight down. It has the nukes. Hale takes
Terry’s gun from her.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You gonna shoot out the tires?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Humvees can reseal and inflate with the flick
of a switch. That’s why Deak chose ’em. Terry looks at Hale – then what
is he going to do?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m gonna steal it. You get to a phone and
call McMurran.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The nearest phone is a two-hour walk.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Then you better start walking.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Look, I know my way around here. You’re gonna
need me.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I appreciate what you’ve done so far. But now
it gets hairy. Go to the phone. He scrambles off over the rock.</p>
<p><strong>the humvees</strong>: Come around a corner. The trail hugs
the face of a ten-foot- high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff…</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Jump down onto the roof of the lead
Humvee. Hale looks at Terry, angry. But before he can say anything…</p>
<p><strong>in the humvee</strong>: Baker swerves, trying to throw them
off. He pulls out a pistol, shoots up through the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the
gun. It falls from his hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>in the second humvee</strong>: Deakins points at Hale,
getting to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Run him down.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins’
Humvee closes fast.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Looks back, sees Hale’s predicament.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Here! She slides the pistol along the truck
roof.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Grabs the gun out of the air as…</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: Slams on the brakes.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Comes flying off the top, landing on the
hood, barely holding on.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He
jumps up, turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the
tailgate facing backwards and fires into Deakins’ windshield.</p>
<p><strong>deakins and kelly</strong>: Kelly ducks below the dash and
slams on the brakes but Deakins doesn’t flinch. The bullets bounce off
the glass –bulletproof.</p>
<p><strong>in the lead humvee</strong>: Baker sticks his gun out the
window and aims at Terry and starts to pull the trigger when he stops,
feeling a gun against the back of his head.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger
seat.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Gimme the gun and get out.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. I think we got ourselves a little stand-off.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No, we don’t. Hale shoots Baker in the thigh.
Baker howls.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Reaches forward and grabs Baker’s gun as…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in
front of…</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ humvee</strong>: And is run over.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You drive!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from
Hale. She jams Baker’s gun into her belt.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’d yell at you for coming after me, but you
did just save my life.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: What’re you doing, Hale?</p>
<p><strong>in hale and terry’s humvee</strong>: Hale keeps his back to
the other Humves. He pulls gaffer’s tape off a roll, tears it with his
teeth, grabs…</p>
<p><strong>a flare</strong>: Out of the tool kit.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Maybe he’ll set off a nuke. That’d show
us.</p>
<p><strong>between the humvees</strong>: Hale tosses the jerry can of
gasoline out the back of the Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>the jerry can of gasoline</strong>: Flies through the air.
There’s a burning flare taped to the side of the plastic can.</p>
<p><strong>ecu tip of flare</strong>: As the plastic of the can bubbles
and melts and…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Stop! But it’s too late and…</p>
<p><strong>the jerry can</strong>: Explodes.</p>
<p><strong>the second humvee</strong>: Skids to a stop, showered with
burning gasoline. Deakins and his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and
Pritchett run for cover.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts
spraying.</p>
<p><strong>in hale and terrys humvee</strong>: Hale climbs up into the
front seat. Terry looks at him, genuinely impressed.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We need somewhere to hide.</p>
<p>****: I know a place.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It was a copper mine, barely squeaking along
for years. They shut it-down a few months ago when they hit an
underground river. The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the
doors rip loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.
He motions for Terry to drive it in.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: They hardwired in their frequency. We can’t
call out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What are we gonna do? Hale goes to the back
of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m gonna take away Deakins’ reason for being
here. Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a panel
on the side of one of the B-83s.</p>
<p><strong>inside panel</strong>: There’s an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC
KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the current time. The keys are oversized and
brightly colored.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: They’re designed to be used by guys wearing
gloves in Alaska. He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights
up.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: These nukes have security codes. If you enter
the wrong code three times, the nuke goes dead – all the circuitry
shorts out and shuts down. Kind of like the security systems with car
radios.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And people say the public doesn’t benefit
from defense spending.</p>
<p>****: Hand me the radio. Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees
something.</p>
<p><strong>a plastic name tag</strong>: Sticking out from under one of
the nukes.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Pulls it out, looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>ecu nametag</strong>: It’s from “St. Judes Hospital,
Radiology Department.”</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Hale turns to Terry as she pulls
over the radio mike.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Where’s St. Judes Hospital?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Deak – you there?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We’re starting a new
round. You took the first couple, but I’ve got you on the ropes now, you
son of bitch. Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio
mike.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Hey, there. What was that last part? There
was some static.</p>
<p>****: Find them.</p>
<p>****: Let’s go! Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like
the one Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>crosscut between hale and deakins</strong>: Kelly drives
Deakins’ Humvee along the trail as they talk.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I know you’re stalling while you try to find
the nukes with your scanner, but you’re gonna be too late. Hear that?
Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m entering the wrong code, you bastard. A
couple more times and these are gonna be useless to you.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You really got me there. I sure didn’t
think of that. Hale slows down – something’s wrong – Deakins doesn’t
cars.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: All that time we spent in the cockpit
together and you think I’m stupid? I got some new boards and circuits
from a friend at Pantex. But nice try. Hale curses to himself. Terry
looks at him. He shakes his head they’re in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You know, Hale, I thought of asking you to
join me on this. You wanna know why I didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Because I would’ve said no?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I would’ve just killed you if you said no.
I was more afraid you’d say yes. Because I knew I couldn’t count on you.
You can pretend you’ve got guts, but when and if it comes down to it,
you’re gonna run off crying like a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You better hope that’s true, Doak. Because
I’ve got the nukes, and there’s nothing to stop me from entering the
right code, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Nah. You’re right. I wouldn’t have the guts.
END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: How deep is this mine?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know. A couple thousand feet.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: That’s deep enough. Hale opens the elevator
gate.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: A nuclear explosion. Terry’s jaw drops.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Got it! They’re –</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: In the mine. I could tell he was inside
something. There was an echo.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: We can still hide them!</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: He’s got a scanner. He’d find them.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re talking about setting off a nuclear
weapon!</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: They set them off underground in Nevada all
through the fifties and sixties. There’s no risk.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Tell it to the two-headed cows. Hale grabs
the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can barely move the thing.
He turns to Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No! I am not helping you set off a nuclear
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We won’t be down there when it goes off. This
isn’t a suicide mission.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No!</p>
<p>****: All right. Fine. Though I think you should know, before I
ejected, I heard Deakins say the nukes were going to be used to wipe out
the last few remaining handicapped gay whales. Terry looks at him – you
asshole. Hale looks at her, very serious.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I need your help. Terry thinks, shakes her
head, steps up and grabs the nuke.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: When we get to the bottom we’ll have to get
away from this shaft. It’ll limit the amount of radiation released
into-the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: We’ll each drag one down a tunnel?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No. I’m only going to set off one. We’ll leave
the other one here. It’ll be buried under a billion tons of rock. They
are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We better hurry. Let’s try down there.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I can’t wait to see how this fits into
your plan. Deakins’ charm peels away for an instant and he fixes
Pritchett with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back.</p>
<p><strong>on the monitors</strong>: A wide-view, bird’s-eye, thermal
image of rocky terrain.</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: This is the KH-12 satellite’s infrared view
of the area. An exposed nuclear core would be relatively hot – it’d show
as a circle of bright white. As you can see, there’s nothing. The only
heat signatures we found were these. The image changes. There are four
blotches, glowing a dull red.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: What’s –?</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: We think it’s Colonel Rhodes and his men.
Their bodies. A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman
reaches for a phone.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: I understand, sir.</p>
<p>****: Was I right? Wilkins nods. Giles grins smugly for about half a
second, then realizes what it really means.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: I’ve got ten ships ready to go … We should
be hearing from NEST any minute now.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How do you know how to do this?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Pilots who fly with nuclear weapons have
standing orders to …</p>
<p>****: … “retrieve if possible, disable if necessary and destroy if we
must,” and destroy I must. He stands, looks around. He sees…</p>
<p><strong>eyebolts</strong>: Screwed into the cross beaus on the
ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m gonna need your belt and one of your
socks.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Send it up?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Let’s take care of Hale first. Spread
out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Take your time. Really. Hale has pushed the
open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He tightens a belt around the
open end of the sock.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Okay. Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a
big rock and loops the free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up
a smaller rock.</p>
<p><strong>close on nuclear weapon</strong>: One chip has been pulled
out of a circuit board. Hale very gingerly lays the small rock on top of
the chip.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We make a small hole in the sock, and when
enough sand drains out – and we’re hopefully in New Mexico – the sock is
pulled through the eyebolt, the rock drops… … hitting the rock on this
chip, closing the firing circuit and that’s it. Hale finishes putting
the small rock in position. He stands.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How much time are we going to have?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I don’t know precisely. This isn’t a Swiss
sock. Ten minutes, maybe – Hale is cut off by…</p>
<p><strong>bullets</strong>: Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls,
fired by…</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Thirty yards down the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Dive to the ground. They pull
pistols, start shooting.</p>
<p><strong>the sock</strong>: One of Johnson’s bullets cuts through
it.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Sand is draining out of the sock very
fast.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Reaches up to grab the big rock, but
Johnson sends a spray of bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: The sock – More bullets. Terry pulls Hale.
They run down a side passage. Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as
they run out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Shoots after them, then runs up to the
weapon. He reaches for the rock, stops – maybe that’ll set it off.</p>
<p><strong>the sock</strong>: The last sand pours out; the sock is
sucked through the eye-bolt.</p>
<p><strong>the rock</strong>: Drops fast toward the nuke.</p>
<p><strong>a hand</strong>: Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand
belongs to…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales,
and tosses the rock. He pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into
it.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: We’re at the end of tunnel three.</p>
<p>****: You two get this one set. I’ll take the other one up.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Running along a tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Beat ’em back to the elevator. Stop ’em from
getting out. Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met
by…</p>
<p><strong>a flurry of bullets</strong>: Fired by…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: With his Uzi.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Run back down the side tunnel,
bullets winging off the rock all around them, shooting back. Hale starts
shooting out the lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Slows down.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: The bit with the sock was good. I like it.
Still, I’m gonna use the the Field Expedient Tactical Timer. It’s a
little more precise.</p>
<p>****: See, Hale – you aren’t the only one who’s thought of setting
off a nuke in this mine.</p>
<p><strong>by the nuke</strong>: Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly
flips on a lamp on a headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up
the metal briefcase he’s been carrying.</p>
<p><strong>inside the briefcase</strong>: An elaborate electronic
timer.</p>
<p><strong>in the tunnels</strong>: Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I need a demonstration. Otherwise, some
swinging dick in Washington is going to say I don’t have the balls or
the ability to set off a nuclear weapon. I’m gonna show these puppies
I’m ready, willing and able. Hell, I’m eager. Deakins jams in his clip,
walks into the dark part of the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: In the dark, waiting to ambush
Deakins and then…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Opens fire – but not at Hale and Terry – at
the cable along the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and
electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light,
showing…</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Suddenly exposed to Deakins’ fire.
The bullets whiz in.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away
his position and Hale and Terry’s bullets scream in at him. He backs
around a corner.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Take cover. It’s a stand-off.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Well, Hale, I better be going. Look at it
this way, partner. If you wanted to get closer to God, you are about to
get your wish. Hale hears Deakins’ footsteps start off.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You’re gonna ransom Salt Lake City, aren’t
you? The footsteps stop.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: What makes you think that?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: That’s where St. Judes Hospital is. You’re
gonna hide the nukes near the radiology department so they won’t show up
an any satellite radiation scans.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: How much are you gonna ask for?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Enough. I’ve got a broker in Stockholm.
Monday morning he’s going to buy me five percent of Volvo. For the rest
of my days I’m going to live off the dividends, happy in the knowledge
I’m helping to build the safest car in the world.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: So that’s it? You’re just doing ’this for the
money? I’m kind of disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Why would you do it, Hale?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: That’s the thing – I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: If you were me.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: If I were you…? Because … because I got passed
over for promotion and goddamnit I’m going to show the bastards that I’m
smarter than them all. Because … everyone’s selling out and cashing in,
so why not me?</p>
<p>****: Because … because my ex-wife was sleeping around. Because my
parents abused me. Because I ate some sugar.</p>
<p>****: Because I don’t like Mondays.</p>
<p>****: It’s all bullshit, Deak. There are no reasons. Not really.
There’s no difference between you and the guy who shoots up the
schoolyard with an M-16. You both think you have reasons. You both think
you were wronged. The truth? You’re both just fucked in the head.</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ face</strong>: Grim, evil – fades into darkness as
he turns and walks off.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: They hear footsteps, receding. Hale
bolts out of their hiding spot. Terry follows.</p>
<p><strong>the timer</strong>: Starts ticking down from ton minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kelly and johnson</strong>: Grab their guns and run.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Mr. Pritchett!</p>
<p><strong>kelly and johnson</strong>: Run in. A half-second of surprise
is broken when…</p>
<p><strong>the elevator</strong>: Comes down.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Make a move toward the elevator,
but…</p>
<p><strong>kelly and johnson</strong>: Unload with their Uzis.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Back around a corner, side by side,
shooting their pistols.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Is shot, drops.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Grabs Johnson’s Uzi and, firing both guns,
backs to the elevator, kicks open the gate with his foot and gets
inside. He hits the UP button with the butt of one of the guns and the
elevator starts to rise.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Step out of the tunnel and fire on
the climbing elevator.</p>
<p><strong>insert - ecu nuke timer</strong>: Seven minutes and
counting.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: We can go back, try to shut it down.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We don’t know the code, and Deak’d have it
wired to blow if we so much as look at it funny.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Then we’re… Hale looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t’ve let you come.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, God. Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds
her.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I … I just hope someone remembers to feed my
dog. Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but Hale
puts a finger to his lips – he’s heard something – a distant
rushing.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Come on. Hale pulls Terry, running, down the
far tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What’re you –?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You said they shut down the mine when they hit
an underground river.</p>
<p><strong>the nest helicopter</strong>: Coming toward him, two miles
away.</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: Ten o’clock! In the clearing!</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The blackened Humvee and Deakins by the
mine entrance.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Dark water rushes by ten feet below
them.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Any idea where it goes?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No. They look at each other. They don’t have
any choice. They flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water
and are swept from view.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Get in. We’re leaving.</p>
<p>****: Aren’t you going to wait for them?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: No time. And if they get out, they might
talk. Fortunately, there’s something wrong with the elevator. Deakins
opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly and the thing shuts
down.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Wrong person to screw with, Deak.</p>
<p><strong>the elevator shaft</strong>: Kelly swings under the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I know the goddamn code, asshole. He grabs
the cable trailing off below the elevator and starts sliding down it
into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>insert - ecu nuke timer</strong>: Two minutes and
counting.</p>
<p><strong>stalactites</strong>: Jutting down like knives, ready-to rip
then open.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Dodge them, push off, duck under.
And then they notice that…</p>
<p><strong>the ceiling</strong>: Is getting lower, getting closer to the
surface of the water. They’re running out of breathing room. Three feet,
two feet, one foot. They take big breaths, maybe their last, and
they’re…</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: Tumbling along, pulled at by the eddies,
flashlights showing their faces – they are running out of air. And then,
there’s light above them in the water.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Lungs bursting, they start kicking
up.</p>
<p><strong>the nest helicopter</strong>: Closing in on him.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Is holding on tight as Deakins drives
wildly.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I think I’ve finally figured out your
plan. Those guys in the helicopter are going to kill us, but we’re going
to rise from the dead and</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Very suddenly and very violently lashes
out. The side of his hand hits Pritchett in the throat.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any
air. He pulls at his throat, even pounds himself in the back of the
neck. No go. He slowly slumps, dying, skin turning blue.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Maybe now you’ll shut up.</p>
<p><strong>insert - ecu nuke timer</strong>: Thirty seconds and
counting.</p>
<p><strong>in the humvee</strong>: Deakins has a thought and looks over
at Pritchett, dead, held up by the seatbelt.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I just realized I’ve never killed anyone
before. I mean, I dropped bombs on Baghdad, but never face to face.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know what the big deal is.</p>
<p><strong>ecu nuke timer</strong>: Eighteen seconds left.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Runs up, starts entering numbers into the
timer keypad.</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: Let him know we’re here!</p>
<p><strong>the trip odometer</strong>: It clicks over from 2.9 to 3.0
miles.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Grins, steps on the brakes.</p>
<p><strong>the nest helicopter</strong>: A hundred feet in the air,
slowly coming in toward Deakins.</p>
<p><strong>ecu nuke timer</strong>: Eleven, ten, nine…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Punches in the last two numbers of the code
then ENTER.</p>
<p><strong>ecu nuke timer</strong>: It stops with seven seconds left.
The amber light goes off and the red light comes on.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Sits back on the floor, takes a breath.</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ hand</strong>: He’s holding a small black box. He
presses a button and…</p>
<p><strong>the timer</strong>: The red light goes out. The amber light
comes on. A splitsecond later, the green light comes on.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Oh shit. The screen goes white.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Watching the helicopter, listening to Hunt
over the loudspeaker.</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: Do not move or you will be fired –</p>
<p><strong>the ground</strong>: Rises up beneath Deakins.</p>
<p><strong>high angle - wide shot</strong>: The ripples of the shockwave
shoot out from the mine, shaking dust and dirt into the air with an
incredible, deafening roar.</p>
<p><strong>deakins amd the humvee</strong>: Fly ten feet into the
air.</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: No…! They plummet.</p>
<p><strong>the nest helicopter</strong>: Drops out of sight behind a
rock formation. There’s an explosion and a ball of fire shoots up.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: That’s all we need. A goddamn earthquake.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Son, I was at the Nevada Test site in the
fifties. That wasn’t an earthquake.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: At least I know they work.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Get me the Room.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: I have to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: You’re going to be fine. It was
underground. Colonel Wilkins for General Creeley.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: For one thing, if it was above ground, it
wouldn’t have caused the same kind of ground tremor. For another, if it
was above ground, we’d all be blind and dying. Sir, we’ve just had a
detonation.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: How’d that happen?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: I don’t know, but thank God it happened
underground.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: First thing we do is put a huge goddamn
lid on this thing. With all due respect to your boy Giles and his belief
in honesty as the best policy, from now on and until the end of time,
what happened in Utah tonight was an earthquake. All right? Baird
nods.</p>
<p><strong>in the humvee</strong>: Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor
along. Deakins turns to Pritchett as if Pritchett had just asked him a
question.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: The helicopter? It was hit by EMP.
Electromagnetic pulse. It’s released in a nuclear detonation. It wipes
out anything electronic for miles. That”s another reason I wanted to set
off a nuke. I knew it’d bring down any helicopters coming for us. It’ll
also shut down all radio communications for a few hours, which will
severely screw up their response.</p>
<p>****: You see, Mr. Pritchett? There really is nothing for you to
worry about. Pritchett’s body seems to nod from the motion of the
Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>butterflies</strong>: Hover and dance over the water in the
early morning light.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it
out.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Goddamn it! He turns to see Terry trying to
undo her buttons but unable to her fingers are too numb.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Stupid buttons. I hate these shirts. They’re
ugly and stupid and – Terry suddenly starts crying. It’s not the shirt
she’s upset about. Hale holds her.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: We just … I mean, we almost…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: A nuclear bomb went off.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: That it did.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Are we…?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Look.</p>
<p>****: If the butterflies are okay, then we’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Absolutely. It says so in the manual. “If you
see butterflies after a detonation, you are fine.” Terry looks at Hale.
She knows he’s bullshitting her, but she appreciates it. They look at
each other. They could kiss … but they both shy away from it. Terry gets
her shirt off.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We better get moving. We might be able to
reach Deakins when he gets to the river. They start off along a trail by
the river.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Something I’ve been meaning to ask. How did
someone like you end up with a gun?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I hit a bankrobber with a frozen chicken.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I came out here one summer during college. It
was the campaign to stop the dam in the Grand Canyon. I loved it here. I
came back, worked as a river guide and eventually stayed year-round.
When a Park Ranger job came open, I applied.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m still waiting for the chicken.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The local Parks Department wasn’t sure how
I’d do with the law enforcement part of the job. Well, one night I was
coming home from the store and Tommy Drewson part of the local brain
trust was robbing old Bob Kearney in front of the ATM. I bear old Bob
yelling and I see Tommy heading for his car, so I tossed a bag of
groceries at him at thirty miles an hour. A frozen chicken in the bag
hit him in the forehead and he dropped like a rock. Next thing I know,
I’m a Ranger. Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the
river bank. A man with an Uzi – SHEPPARD – waits, duffel bag by his
feet.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Get me a frozen Zacky’s fryer and he’s a dead
man. There’s the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands, gun
ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Appears, walking down a footpath toward
Sheppard.</p>
<p><strong>sheppard</strong>: Where is everyone?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I am everyone. Let’s go. Sheppard hurries
to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: We’re the only ones who know what’s going on,
and I don’t have the faintest idea how we’re gonna stop them.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You have so far. Hale looks at Terry – she’s
right. But it almost pisses him off more than it gives him confidence.
He grumbles to himself and starts off down toward the raft.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sink it?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Steal it. They get down to the raft. They
climb in. Hale grabs the engine throttle, slumps.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Keys. Hale looks around, spots Sheppard’s
duffel bag lying on the riverbank. He hops out and starts rummaging
through it when they hear grunting and feet approaching. Hale looks
around for a place to hide. There isn’t any. Terry tries to get out of
the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin bunched on the bottom of the
raft. she drops.</p>
<p><strong>with deakins and sheppard</strong>: Coming down a path,
lugging the last remaining nuke.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Of the raft. Hale and Terry are nowhere
to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the
raft, very silent. He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the
raft.</p>
<p><strong>sheppard</strong>: Why were you driving around with a dead
guy?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Because I like him. He doesn’t ask a lot of
annoying questions. All right? A few seconds later the engine starts up.
Hale ducks down under water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces
to watch the raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.</p>
<p><strong>on the raft - moving</strong>: The nuke is on a pallet in the
middle of the raft. Sheppard pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees
what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>a tarp</strong>: Is lying on the deck of the raft along one
side, all bunched up. It’d be the kind of thing you’d hide under.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Grabs the tarp and pulls.</p>
<p><strong>under the tarp</strong>: There’s no one there.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does,
we PAN OVER to…</p>
<p><strong>a long crate marked “life jackets”</strong>: Strapped to one
of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth is sticking out from
inside the crate – like the corner of a shirt. It’s quickly pulled out
of sight from within.</p>
<p><strong>back on the riverbank</strong>: Hale climbs out of the water
and looks around, not knowing quite what to do.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Your friends in Washington should be getting
the package about now.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I wish I could see their faces.</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: Camcorder shot of Deakins against a black
backdrop.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: … two-hundred-and-fifty million dollars, by
nine a.m. Utah time. The depositing instructions are in the envelope
that came with this tape. This deadline is not negotiable, and there is
no grace period. The device is on a timer. Shortly after you receive
this, the timer will be activated. At nine a.m., I will make a call. If
I find out you’ve done as you’ve been told, I will stop the timer. If
you have not complied – The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images
of nuclear destruction – buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom
clouds, shockwaves, fires.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Turn that off!</p>
<p><strong>a marina</strong>: Where houseboats are rented out. Hale’s
eyes focus on a sign with a picture of a phone on it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jumps up from the raft and runs after the
truck, staying right behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up.
She holds on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Yes, sir. Creeley’s phone rings. He answers
it.</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: Creeley.</p>
<p>****: The President wants to know if we know where the device is
headed.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: If Deakins had a plane waiting, it could
be anywhere. We just don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>creeley</strong>: I do. Major Hale is alive. According to
him, Colonel Deakins is headed for Salt Lake City.</p>
<p><strong>hale, wilkins and giles</strong>: Are walking toward the
second helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: We found the raft on the other side of the
lake. Tracks from a heavy truck ran out when they hit the paved
road.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: If we get a rad scanner we can track them. A
brief look between Wilkins and Giles.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Actually, Major, we’re going back to
McMurran.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: We’d just like to ask you a few
questions.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I’m not wasting time answering questions.
We’ve got –</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: No debate, Major. I was given orders. Now,
you can come with us, or you can go with them. Wilkins nods over at the
other helicopter. The troops standing in front of it are MPs. Hale looks
at Wilkins, astounded.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Deakins thinks I’m dead. He thinks it’s over.
You’ve got to let me go after him. I can help. I know how his mind
works.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Major, I know this is personal for you, but
I think we can handle it. We’re putting a wall of men and machines
around Salt Lake City as we speak. That truck is not getting
through.</p>
<p><strong>close on the nuclear weapon</strong>: Dusty slices of light
come through the truck’s slatted walls. The nuclear weapon is lashed to
a hammock, straps running off to D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up
an electronic timer.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: What about the Ranger?</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: When you find that truck, you’ll hit it hard.
Chances are she’ll be killed in the crossfire. “Regrettable but
unavoidable.”</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Look, she’s not supposed to be there. She
should be checking camping permits, finding lost kids. She…</p>
<p>****: She saved my life. Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins,
but…</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: We were ordered to take you back to
McMurran. You understand what orders are, don’t you, Major? Wilkins
turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing what to do. He
quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter’s weapons rack and puts it to
Wilkin’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Major, put that away or say goodbye to your
career and hello to twenty years in Leavenworth.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: If that’s what it takes.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: You’ll have to shoot me. Hale thinks, but
there’s no way he can do that. He lowers the gun, sits back. Giles gets
Hale’s attention, then points to his own head. Hale doesn’t understand,
so Giles grabs Hale’s gunhand and puts the gun up to his head.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Colonel! How about this? Wilkins looks back,
sees Hale holding the gun to Giles’ head.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I swear to God I’ll shoot. Wilkins grins.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Wait until I get back. I’m going to check
on Sheppard. Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: I don’t know what you’re looking for,
Major. Every road between here and salt Lake has already been
sealed.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Deak would know that. Maybe he’s not on the
road. Wilkins doesn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: They were using maps like these to set up the
roadblocks?</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Then that’s the answer. Wilkins doesn’t
understand. Hale points outside, down at…</p>
<p><strong>train tracks</strong>: On the ground. Old ones, half-covered
by weeds.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: It’s an old spur. Probably hasn’t been used in
twenty years. Nobody bothered to put it on the new maps.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: What are you –?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: The nuke isn’t in a truck, Colonel. It’s on a
train.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Climbs out and we discover that indeed they
are not in a truck, they’re in a train. The “nuke boxcar” has a small
satellite dish mounted on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>the four gunmen</strong>: Are in position at points along the
train, ready with Uzis.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Radio’s still down. We’ll head north, look
for a phone, then look for a train. Giles nods. Hale is thinking.
Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No. Go south.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Salt Lake is north.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: He’s not going to Salt Lake.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: But you said it would be Salt Lake. You found
that hospital tag.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: He planted that. He wanted whoever found it to
think that’s where he was going. He’s been doing a rope-a-dope. Giles
and Wilkins look at him like he’s nuts.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: It’s a boxing term. When Ali – Look, I know
this guy. If everything has been saying he’s heading north, then he’s
heading south. They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: What’s south of here?</p>
<p><strong>ecu map</strong>: Wilkins’ finger follows the train line on
the map. It goes right into Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No. Not Vegas. What the hell is there to blow
up in Vegas? Wilkins’ finger keeps moving on the map.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: The President. Wilkins’ finger stops.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Crouching down between the two cars.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>sheppard</strong>: Almost done.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into
the driver’s compartment. She hears…</p>
<p><strong>sheppard</strong>: How long until the helicopter gets
here?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Five minutes. We’ll leave from the boxcar
roof.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is hiding on the other side of the engine,
very quiet and still. As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine,
Terry follows.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: As he puts a gun to the back of Terry’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>wilkins’ helicopter</strong>: Comes in, gets about three feet
off the ground and Giles jumps out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the
helicopter pulls up and flies away, leaving the Rancher agog.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Terry, Max. Max, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A pleasure. What the hell is a “Terry” and why
is it still live?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: She asked me how I thought I was going to
get away with this and I thought I’d tell her. We’re going to a cabin in
the mountains, not far from here. When we get there I’m gonna make two
phone calls.</p>
<p>****: See, all their forces are up at Salt Lake by now. By the time
they could get a F-15 down here the train will be on the outskirts of
Vegas. And I’ll remind them about the impact trigger – if they hit this
train hard, the nuke’ll blow. They won’t have any choice. They’ll have
to let the train get into the city and because of that, they’ll have to
pay.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You said two phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: The second will be to my bank in Geneva. If
the money’s in my account, I use this… like a modified cell-</p>
<p>****: … and shut down the timer. If not, we sit back, put on some
shades and get a quick tan.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: But – radio isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You saw the dish on the roof? Microwave.
It’s not affected by EMP. See? I really have thought of everything.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You kept her alive just so you can impress her
with how smart you are?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: No, I kept her alive because I want her to
do me a favor. See, if something goes wrong and this thing goes off, a
half a million people are going to be vaporized. I don’t want that on my
conscience. So I’m not going to arm the nuke.</p>
<p>****: She is.</p>
<p><strong>air force assistant</strong>: Starting at ground zero and
moving out, we have, in terms of immediate effect, one hundred percent
fatalities to thirty miles. Ninety percent from thirty to forty miles,
dropping roughly ten percent for every-ten miles after that. The long
term –</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Son?</p>
<p><strong>air force assistant</strong>: Two hundred and fifty thousand
in the first few seconds. The same again within a year.</p>
<p><strong>baird</strong>: Good God.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Nine … Then pound … Good. Now six …</p>
<p><strong>ecu terry’s eyes</strong>: Filled with tears. She blinks
and…</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: Terry has visions of RETIREES in Vegas,
watering potted plants outside their motor home, of TEENAGERS ragging on
each other as they walk to school, of CHILDREN in a playground.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Seven … Star … One…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Then ENTER and it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Her finger hovers over the ENTER button,
almost pushes it, then shifts to CANCEL and pushes that.</p>
<p><strong>ecu nuke timer</strong>: The display goes blank.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Stunned. He shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Ooh. You really shouldn’t have done that. I
said I would kill you, and I will.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m gonna be dead either way. I don’t want
any part of this. Deakins shrugs – he sees her logic. He puts his gun to
Terry’s head. Terry shuts her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Night-night. Deakins is about to pull the
trigger when Max stops him. Max gestures – listen. They hear a
helicopter approaching. Max checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: They’re early. Just then, they hear
gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: It’s not a problem. Set the timer, then
kill her. Have fun with it. Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the
hatch.</p>
<p><strong>terry’s hand</strong>: Rests on Max’s tool tray. Her fingers
creep over to a vrench.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Presses ENTER and finishes setting the
timer.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>terry and max</strong>: Terry swings hard and fast with the
wrench, knocking the gun out of Max’s hand. Max spins, and when Terry
swings at him again. Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up
fast and hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops
straight back.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thought I was just friendly old Max, huh? Lady,
I was a Navy SEAL. You should see what I can do with just my thumb. Max
goes for his gun.</p>
<p><strong>terry’s hand</strong>: Grabs onto something. It’s the
wrench.</p>
<p><strong>terry and max</strong>: As Max turns back with the gun, Terry
heaves the wrench. It hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a
rock.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah? Well, you should see what I can do with
just a chicken.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: That’s him!</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: They’ve got guns!</p>
<p><strong>wilkins</strong>: You’ve got a helicopter. Use it!</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Comes swooping in.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Sees what’s going to happen and turns and
runs as…</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Drops down beside the train. The
rotor blades whip about three feet over the train roof and the pilot
starts forward.</p>
<p><strong>deakins and the gunman</strong>: Run from the blades as fast
as they can.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Closes fast.</p>
<p><strong>deakins and the gunman</strong>: Jump from car to car. The
gunman passes Deakins. Just when the helicopter blades are about to
catch up to Deakins…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Jumps down between two boxcars and the
rotor blades go right over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a
scream cut short.</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pov</strong>: Swooping fast over the train when
suddenly…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Pull up!</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Pulls up fast.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Watches the helicopter bank away.
Bullets-start whizzing by her.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Has climbed up and is shooting at her.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Runs away from Deakins, shooting Max’s pistol
behind her blindly.</p>
<p><strong>two gunmen</strong>: Appear two cars ahead of Terry and start
toward her, shooting.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is caught between Deakins and the gunmen with
no way out when…</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Comes along the length of the train,
flying low. It rises up and there’s…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked
to a harness and he’s firing a pistol, shooting right over Terry at…</p>
<p><strong>the first gunman</strong>: He’s hit, falls off the train.</p>
<p><strong>the second gunman</strong>: Aims at Terry and starts
firing.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The bullets rip up the boxcar roof around
her. She jumps up and grabs onto…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: As he swings in on the cable, shooting his
pistol.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Are lifted up and over…</p>
<p><strong>the second gunman</strong>: Who turns, firing a shotgun.
Hale’s bullets find him. He falls.</p>
<p><strong>sheppard</strong>: Appears, firing an Uzi at Hale, Terry and
the helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>in the helicopter</strong>: Bullets rip through. Wilkins is
hit, knocked back.</p>
<p><strong>the cable holding hale and terry</strong>: Is severed by one
of Sheppard’s bullets.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Drop ten feet to the roof of a
boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.</p>
<p><strong>sheppard</strong>: Is hit and drops.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Banks away fast, making ugly sounds,
smoke billowing out. The engine cuts out and the helicopter drops to a
hard landing beside the tracks.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Watch the helicopter land as the
train rolls on. They look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You stop the nuke. I’ll stop the train. Hale
nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’d yell at you for coming after me, but you
did just save my life. Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the
distance. They look over to see…</p>
<p><strong>a red cross helicopter</strong>: Coming in fast.</p>
<p><strong>hale and terry</strong>: Any excitement turns to confusion
when they see…</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Standing in the doorway of the Red Cross
helicopter, holding a gun.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That’s Deakins’ escape route.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Not any more. Terry nods. They share a last
look, then Terry heads off. Male coils up the winch cable, slings it
over his shoulder and heads for the nuke boxcar and his old friend
Deakins. He picks up…</p>
<p><strong>the shotgun</strong>: Left by deceased Gunman #2.</p>
<p><strong>a pickup truck</strong>: Tearing toward then along a dirt
road, horn honking.</p>
<p><strong>close on pickup</strong>: The RANCHER from the mini-mart is
driving; Giles beside him.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached
to the harness. Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the
side of the train.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing
the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>the gunman</strong>: Is picked up by the blast and smashed
back through the wood slat wall of the boxcar and out of the train.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Climbs up fast through the hatch to the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks
empty. Hale tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He
drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>the red cross helicopter</strong>: Hovers in sideways toward
the train. The MAN in the doorway holds out a hand to Deakins.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Is reaching for the man’s hand and grabs it
when…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto
Deakins’ foot.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds
onto the man in the helicopter and is pulled onboard.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Moves sideways over the train.</p>
<p><strong>in the helicopter</strong>: Deakins turns, pulling his gun
and shoots down at the train as…</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Moves back sideways over the
train.</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ pov</strong>: No sign of Hale on the train roof.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Get us out of here!</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he
gets an odd expression. The helicopter isn’t doing what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Is hovering over the train, but it
can’t fly away because…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Is hanging onto the skids and he’s hooked the
cable to the skid. The other end of the cable is still attached to the
hatch.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Strains against the cable, but it
doesn’t snap.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>power lines</strong>: Cross the track, a quarter-mile
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi,
shooting down at…</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to
the roof of the train, bullets plugging in all around his. He jumps down
through the hatch as…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Sees what’s coming and jumps.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Hits…</p>
<p><strong>the power likes</strong>: Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap
around the helicopter’s rotor.</p>
<p><strong>the helicopter</strong>: Breaks up and flies apart as the
train rolls on.</p>
<p><strong>the toyota</strong>: Explodes.</p>
<p><strong>ecu nuke timer</strong>: Five minutes and counting.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Looks at it, trying to figure out how to
disarm it. He hears the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the
boxcar. He turns.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be
cool, but…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: They would’ve paid and I would’ve stopped
it. You’ve made a very, very big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: It’s over, Deak. I beat you. Disarm it.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: If it’s over and you beat me, you disarm
it.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Deak…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Course you are going to need this.</p>
<p>****: All you have to do is get it.</p>
<p>****: And if you do, as a special added bonus, you get this. Deakins
pulls out…</p>
<p><strong>the twenty dollar bill</strong>: Then pockets it.</p>
<p><strong>hale and deakins</strong>: Share a look. Deakins puts up his
fists.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Ready? Hale puts up his fists.</p>
<p><strong>between boxcar and car carrier</strong>: Terry is looking
under the car carrier.</p>
<p><strong>terry’s pov</strong>: The train car axle is smoking,
grinding, glowing red in the heat from the flaming Toyotas.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Modern boxing is a pussy sport. They want
to make it about scoring points. It’s not about scoring points! It’s
about this!</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Okay. You’re bleeding. Good. In the old
fights, there’d be so much blood, guys would slip and fall. Let’s see if
we can’t get a little more of that red goo out of you. Ready? Again
Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but is sent
back.</p>
<p><strong>cu train axle</strong>: The axle is bending, grinding,
groaning.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is between the car carrier and a boxcar,
looking down at the axle, not knowing what the hell she’s going to do
when she hears a horn honking. She turns.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Used to be, every fight was to a knockout.
You know what happens when you get knocked out? It’s your brain slapping
against the inside of your skull. Here. I’ll let you see what it’s like.
Ready? Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he’s got, gets Deakins under
the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing prone, seeing stars.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light
of the hatch above him. And then…</p>
<p><strong>the train</strong>: Jumps the tracks.</p>
<p><strong>the nuclear weapon</strong>: Swings wildly in the hammock
webbing.</p>
<p><strong>the straps</strong>: Securing the webbing to the walls of the
car start to snap.</p>
<p><strong>flaming toyotas</strong>: Fly, tumble, explode.</p>
<p><strong>the nuke boxcar</strong>: Goes down the steep slope of the
embankment and stops.</p>
<p><strong>the train</strong>: The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and
smoke. Burning Toyotas.</p>
<p><strong>the nuclear weapon</strong>: It’s above him, at the end of
the car. It’s hanging in mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps
are the only things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet
to the bottom of the car.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Is lying at the bottom of the car, directly
under the nuke, not moving.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Looks around for something. He sees it –</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ remote control device</strong>: On the floor.</p>
<p><strong>deakins’ eyes</strong>: Flicker open. He sees…</p>
<p><strong>a pistol</strong>: Lying a few feet away.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You have to push amber, then red. You might
have time to push amber. You won’t get to red. Hale turns to see…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Pointing a gun at him.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: The nuke is armed, Deak. If it falls, the
impact trigger will set it off.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Half a million people will die.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Fuck ’em if they can’t take a joke.</p>
<p><strong>one of the straps</strong>: Holding the nuke tears through.
One strap left.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: His finger hovers over the amber button.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Do it and I shoot. Hale looks at
Deakins.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I guess you really don’t know me that well
after all. Hale presses the amber button.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Shoots.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Spins back, blood spraying from his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>the remote</strong>: Falls from his hand.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Is about to shoot again, then hears a
tearing and looks up as…</p>
<p><strong>the last strap</strong>: Rips through and…</p>
<p><strong>the nuke</strong>: Drops toward him, point first.</p>
<p><strong>hale’s bloody hand</strong>: Grabs the remote and his finger
presses the RED button.</p>
<p><strong>ecu nuke timer</strong>: Mid-air, dropping, the clock and
display go blank as…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: His eyes fill with true terror as…</p>
<p><strong>the nuclear weapon</strong>: Punches into Deakins, point
first, crushing him.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He
reaches down, opens Deakins’ pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar
