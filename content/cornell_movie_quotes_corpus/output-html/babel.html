<p><strong>hassan</strong>: Good morning Abdullah… I brought you
this…</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: It’s almost new.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: Three hundred cartridges…</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: The hunter who gave it to me said you can
hit up to three kilometers away.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: How much do you want for everything?</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: One thousand dirhams.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: One thousand dirhams? I’ll give you one
thousand and a goat.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: With this rifle, your sons will be able to
kill plenty of jackals.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: Let one of your sons shoot.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Let Yussef shoot.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: I want to shoot first.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: Look, load it like this.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: This is the safety. Push it in when you’re
ready.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: If he doesn’t hit the jackals, at least
he’ll scare the shit out of them.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot better
than you.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: Your lunch.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: You better kill at least three
jackals.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: And make sure no one sees you with the
rifle, hide it if you see someone approach you.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Yussef, Yussef…</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Yussef…</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: I told you not to spy on her again.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: I said don’t spy on her.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: What the hell do you care?</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Five to two.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: There’s a jackal over there.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: What are you doing, you idiot?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Zora doesn’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: She doesn’t, but I do.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: This is between her and me.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: You’re both pigs. Next time I’m going to tell
my dad.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Stay out of this.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: If you want me to stay out of it, don’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Hassan said that it could hit things three
kilometers away, but it can’t even reach that rock over there.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: That’s because you don’t know how to shoot.
Give me the rifle.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: See, it can’t reach it.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Give me another bullet.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: See.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Yeah, but that’s not three kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Yussef, come here.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: I bet you the bullet can’t hit that far
away.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: These fucking bullets aren’t any good.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: You’re not aiming right.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: What’ll you give me if I hit that car?</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: I’ll shoot.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: You see? Nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Let me shoot.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: I told you. Hassan’s a liar.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Shoot at that one…</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: See: nothing.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I won…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, I won.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes… yes sir… yes sir, Mrs. Rachel told
me…I’m very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan?… No sir, don’t worry…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Your dad is calling.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hi dad… dad, guess what? Today, at school,
they brought some baby chickens…I held one in my hand. He was really
little and he was all warm… Dad, are you ok?…And Mariana wanted to take
one home, but the teacher didn’t let her…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Did you brush your teeth?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Will you tell us a story?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: One and then you’re going to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Once there was a hawk who wanted to fly
higher than everyone else. He trained every day and hunted little birds
so he could eat them and be strong.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Pajaritos? Little birds?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Of course, that’s what hawks eat. So, one
day the hawk flew so, so high that it crashed into an airplane. It
fainted and started to fall. And when it was about to hit the ground,
all the birds flew toward him and saved him.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: They saved him?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes, and when the hawk was healthy again he
went to talk to the birds and said: I want to thank you for saving me,
but I can’t change and I’m going to keep hunting you. The little birds
answered: we don’t care that you hunt us, because that’s who you are.
But we will always save you, because that’s who we are.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Did you like it?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Leave it on.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con la luz
apagada.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: But I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No pasa nada.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I’m scared that what happened to Pat is
gonna happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: A ti no te va a pasar eso…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Pat died while she was sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: That only happens to some babies when
they’re really little.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Then why did daddy get so angry at mommy?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: He wasn’t angry, he was just very sad.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He left.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Go to sleep. I’ll sit here with you, but you
can’t talk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Amelia, it’s Richard. We’re going to have
to be here a few more days here in Morocco than we expected and Rachel
wasn’t able to find anyone to take care of the kids.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Your sister-in-law promised me to find
someone.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Amelia, this is very serious.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: It’s because… I told Mrs. Jones three months
ago that today is my son’s wedding.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Amelia, this is an emergency. Cancel your
son’s wedding. I’ll pay for another one.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Sir, everything is ready. Can’t anyone come
take care of the kids? It’s just one day.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We need you, Amelia… hold on.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Amelia, we’re really counting on you. I
have to go. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Do you want another quesadilla?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Mhh.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How many little birds did the hawk eat?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: None, because he started to like
quesadillas.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Is the bus here?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes, but today you’re not going to
school.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We have things to do.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I just want you to take of them for
today.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I can’t, Mrs. Black is home.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And she won’t go out?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Ok, thanks. I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: I can’t Amelia.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Please, it’s my son’s wedding. I helped you
out with that thing with your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: I really can’t.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Just for the day, Lucia. I’ll be back for
them tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: And what do I tell Mrs. Black?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Tell her they’re your nephews.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Yeah right, they look just like me…with this
gringa look I have.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Are we going to see your house?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes, you’re going to see my house.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Is it far?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Not very.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Good morning Aunt Amelia.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Are they coming?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I couldn’t find anyone to leave them with.
Their parents aren’t coming back today.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Why bring them, they’re just going to make
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: They’re good kids.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: I know a woman who can take care of
them.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Santiago, I have to take them. I can’t leave
them with just anybody.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: What if you lose your job?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Come on, don’t tempt the fates.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: The Berbers built these kasbahs. They made
them like forts and here they would reside after finishing their
caravans.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: This place is beautiful, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah, yeah it’s very pretty…</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Now, I’d like to show you the materials that
were used to build the walls…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: You want to order?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’ll have a chicken cous-cous and a Coke,
please.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What do you have that doesn’t have fat in
it?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Everything is delicious.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’ll have the fried eggplant and a diet
Coke.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: We don’t have diet Coke.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Then a regular Coke.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Look, look: a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: This country is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Richard, why did we come here?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What d’you mean why? I thought you would
like it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Really: why are we here?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: To forget everything, to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Throw out the ice.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The Coke is warm.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah, but you don’t know what kind of water
is in there.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why can’t you ever relax. You’re always
stressed.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re the one stressing me out. You’re why I
can’t relax.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You could if you tried.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Tried? Don’t you think I tried?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re never going to forgive me, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Do you even know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Susan, please; we didn’t come all this way
just to argue.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh, we didn’t? Then when are we supposed to
“argue”? Or are you planning on running away again?</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Stilo…stilo…</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Stilo…stilo…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t have any money… I don’t have any…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Susan, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Stop the bus, stop, my wife’s been
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: The ball was out.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: No, it was good.</p>
<p><strong>teammate</strong>: Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: That was out.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: It was on the line.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: You’re not just deaf, you’re blind.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: You’re out.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>teammate 1</strong>: You shouldn’t have lost your temper. We
lost the game.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: It wasn’t my fault, it was the ref.</p>
<p><strong>teammate 2</strong>: If you hadn’t been thrown out, we
would’ve won the game.</p>
<p><strong>teammate 1</strong>: Why are you in a bad mood?</p>
<p><strong>teammate 2</strong>: She’s always in a bad mood because
nobody’s fucked her yet.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: I’m gonna fuck your dad to get rid of my
mood.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: What do you want to eat?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: I said I’d meet my friends from the team at
Eve’s.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: Weren’t we going to have lunch
together?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: Dad, I told you I was going to eat with
them, but you never pay attention to me.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: My mother always paid attention to me.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: Why do you want to fight?</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: I miss your mother too.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: I’m doing what I can, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: Don’t forget you have the dentist at
four.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: I love you very much.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Do you have a table?</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Do you have a table?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: Why all the way in the corner?</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: Because of the view.</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: Do you like him?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Can I play with you?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Do you want to come have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: Tell him I couldn’t read his lips.</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: They look at us like we’re monsters.</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: Oh, come off it.</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: Now they’re going to meet the real hairy
monster.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: I’ll see you later at my place.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Hurry up, man, hurry…</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: I asked you what’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: What do you care, whore?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Don’t talk to her like that.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Something we ate make us sick so we came
back.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Something we ate gave us a stomach ache.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: And is that why you’re insulting your
sister?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: We were feeling really ill.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: The goats are going to feel even worse if
they don’t eat. Take them out again.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Our stomach really hurts.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: Then start jerking the meat.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: D’you think something happened?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: People were screaming.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: It was your fault.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: It was both our faults. We both shot. Swear
to me you’ll never say anything.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Swear. Nobody, never.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: I swear. Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Thank you, I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Tell your mother to prepare dinner.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Mother, mother, father says he wants to have
dinner now.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Did you kill any jackals?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: We shot at them, but didn’t hit them.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: You have to kill them. If not they’re
going to eat all the goats.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: Why are you home so late?</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: They closed the road, and we had to take
the long way around. Apparently some terrorists killed an American
tourist.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: An American?</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Yes, the terrorists attacked a tour bus on
the road.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: But there aren’t any terrorists here.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: You never know.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: And how do you know the American died?</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: That’s what they were saying. The police
are looking for the culprits.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: See how easy it is to get into
paradise?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Is this Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes, this is Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: My mom told us Mexico is really dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Yes, it’s full of Mexicans.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Do you like popsicles?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What’s this flavor called?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Cajeta… it’s called cajeta.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Cayeto…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: No, cajeta… cajeta…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Cajeto, cajeta… It’s the best thing I’ve ever
tasted in my life. Can I buy some for my mom? She’s gonna love them.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Are they crashed cars?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Did lots of people die?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I guess so…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I don’t like Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>comadre 1</strong>: Hey, so you finally made it.</p>
<p><strong>comadre 1</strong>: You brought them?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Hi mom, how’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Son, you look like Pedro Infante.</p>
<p><strong>comadre 1</strong>: More like Luis Miguel.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Where’s the bride?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: She’s not here yet.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What d’you mean she’s not here yet?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Well, she ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Look son, these are Mike and Debbie, the
kids I take care of.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Pleased to meet you Mike.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Psst. Lucio, come here.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: These are Mike and Debbie. Keep an eye on
them for me.</p>
<p><strong>lucio</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>daughter 1</strong>: Oh ma, I don’t know how you did it but
it zipped up perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And it’s been 15 years since I last wore
this dress.</p>
<p><strong>daughter 1</strong>: You haven’t changed a bit, ma.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Working, dear, working, that’s what keeps
one young.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What are you guys laughing about?</p>
<p><strong>daughter 2</strong>: Nothing ma, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Take it easy honey, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m ok… I’m ok…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Is anybody a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Please: a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where’s the nearest hospital?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: It’s far away, about four hours. There’s a
clinic that’s a little closer, about an hour and a half to the south. By
bus it’ll take us about two hours and a half though.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Does that takes away from Marrakesh?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Yes, but it’s the closest thing we’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I need your help. We were attacked.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Help… hospital…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I don’t understand you sir.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Tell him we need his help.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Let’s take her to the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>barth</strong>: Marrakech isn’t this way. They’re going to
shoot at us again.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’ve got to get her to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>barth</strong>: They’re going to kill us all. Turn back… turn
the bus around…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Shut up, god damn it!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It hurts, it hurts…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Easy, sweetie, easy…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It hurts… it hurts so much…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Isn’t there anywhere else we can take
her?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: We can take her to my town. It’s near here
and there’s a doctor. In the meantime we can call Erfourd for an
ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Make a right onto the next road.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Are we here?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Yes sir, this is my house.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Easy, darling, easy…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Don’t touch me there.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Here… here…</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: Put her there…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I need to call an ambulance and contact my
embassy.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: If you have the number of the embassy, I can
go call.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I need to make a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Of course, come with me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Don’t leave me here alone…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: She can take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re going to be ok.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Hold and release the tourniquet every once in
a while.</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: Get out of here… out…</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: How is your wife?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Bad. Very bad.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Get her outta there and let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And where should I take her?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: In Egypt, in a town like this, they slit thirty
German tourists’ throats. They might do the same to us.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: No, not here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What do you know? We have to get out of here as
soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It’s very hot, sir, and the driver turned off
the air conditioning. I’m feeling sick.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You can’t leave us here.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What’s the use in staying?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: In case I need the bus.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: They can go drop us off and then come back
for you.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: I’ll stay with you if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>elyse</strong>: And why would you stay?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Please wait. Let me try to deal with
this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’re not going to risk our lives, so
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: You do what you have to do, we’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: We need your phone. I’ll pay for the
call.</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Can I have some water?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, water…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Where’s my husband?</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: Trust in god.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes… Rachel? It’s Richard…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: �Are you still in Moroccco?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, we’re still in Morocco…Rachel, there
was an accident, your sister was shot…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What? Who shot her?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know… We were shot at from some
hills.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Is she ok?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: She was hit in her neck and shoulder.
Rachel, she’s not doing well… I need you to tell the embassy as soon as
possible… wait… and call Mark…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Anwar, where are we?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: In Tazarine, three hours southwest of
Erfoud.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Were in Tazarine, T-a-z-a-r-I-n-e Three

<p><strong>richard</strong>: Call an ambulance…</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: I’ll call Erfoud so they send one over.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And find a doctor…</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: They’ve already gone to look for him.</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: Anwar, bring me some water.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Why did you bring them here?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: You should have consulted with us.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: She’s hurt, we had to take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: In town they’re saying she was shot by
terrorists. Do you know what they’re going to do to us when they find
out she’s here?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Don’t be paranoid and go help find the
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Get me out of here… please…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m going to as soon as I can. I’ve already
called Rachel; she’s going to tell the embassy.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I told you we shouldn’t have come.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: How long until the ambulance gets here?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: About an hour and a half. It’s coming from
Alnif.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That much? Isn’t there anyone here who
could take her?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’ve got to get her out of here. There’s
no one to tend to her.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: My brother already called a doctor, he’s
coming.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Trust my grandmother; she knows a lot about
remedies.</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: I have to clean you.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Miss, my grandmother is going to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, not that.</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: It will stop the bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, no… not that…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Let’s wait for the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: The sheik and the moukadem are here.</p>

<p><strong>sheik</strong>: I am Atallah the sheik and this is Walid, the
moukadem. I’m very sorry about your wife.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t understand French.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: He says he is very sorry about your wife.</p>
<p><strong>sheik</strong>: Tell him that I want to ask him some
questions.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Can he ask you some questions?</p>
<p><strong>sheik</strong>: Do you have any enemies in this country?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: He asks if you have any enemies in this
country.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>sheik</strong>: Then why were you shot at?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Why did you come to Morocco?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Vacation.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: He has no idea.</p>

these were different cops.</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: Did they come to ask about your mothers’
death?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: No, but they’re probably going to ask my dad
about the same things.</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: They’re just not convinced, are they?</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: Believe it or not, I liked one of the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>mitsu</strong>: Did you put on some panties?</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: entire dialogue in</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Sure. I drive down this road every day. The
American tried to stop me right here.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I was scared. He was covered in blood and I
was coming from picking up my grandson from his work.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Where was the bus?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Look further to the right.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Why did you wait so long to contact the
police?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I had to drive my grandson home.</p>
<p><strong>policeman voice</strong>: Captain Alarid, Captain Alarid… We
found the cartridges.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Stop right there…</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: They’re from around here. Find out who has a
.270 caliber rifle.</p>

down…</p>

<p><strong>hassan</strong>: I didn’t shoot at anyone.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Then who, you idiot?</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: It wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: That was your rifle.</p>
<p><strong>hassan</strong>: No, not anymore, I sold it today.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Oh yeah? To who?</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Take these goat skins to Naguib and see if
he wants to buy them.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Hey, do you know where Abdullah Adboum
lives?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Over there, you have to cross those
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: They told us he lived around here.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: No, we just live here with our mother.

<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: No, they’re not looking for you… they’re
looking for us…</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: You? Why?</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Because of what happened to the tourist…</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: What tourist?</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: The American… Yussef killed her…</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: That’s not true, we both did.</p>
<p><strong>yasira</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Yussef started shooting at the cars because
Hassan said that the bullet could go really far…</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: That’s a lie, you started shooting at the
cars.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Yes, but you killed her.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Yussef killed the American and he spies on
Zora naked and Zora lets him watch her…</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: What is your brother talking about?</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: That’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: It’s not bullshit; she’s a whore and my
brother spies on her…</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: How many pots of rice did you make?</p>
<p><strong>daughter 1</strong>: I made two.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Too many people have come, that’s not going
to be enough. Make two more pots.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: And you Maria Eugenia, warm up more
tortillas.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Santiago… please go kill another six
chickens, or there won’t be enough food.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Luis, the priest is here and Patricia hasn’t
arrived. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Fifteen minutes left before the wedding and

chickens?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Mike and Debbie. Come with me.</p>

<p><strong>luis</strong>: No, not at all.</p>

coming.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Ready. Now who’s going to help me?</p>

<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Hold it tight, like this.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I’m going to see if they’re inside.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Patricia’s not feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Aren’t you going to help?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s not good to kill animals.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Have you ever been to Kentucky Fried
Chicken?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: What? Did you think that Colonel Sanders
kept them as pets?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: My belly’s been hard since the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: That happens when you’re nervous.</p>
<p><strong>madre</strong>: D’you think the baby’s coming?</p>

<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Allah be with you.</p>
<p><strong>anwar’s grandmother</strong>: Allah be with you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The bullet didn’t hit her spine or split her
jugular. But it did shatter her clavicle and she could bleed to
death.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: He says she will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Stop lying to me god damn it, and tell me
what the fuck he said!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hospital… need hospital…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, we know that. What can you do in the
meantime?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Tell him I have to stitch up the wound to
stop the bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: He has to sew up her wounds.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You need some stitches.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What do you mean stitches?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re not going to give her any
anesthetic?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: No, he doesn’t use anesthetic.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What kind of doctor is he?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: He’s a veterinarian, but he is good.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He can’t take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Richard, he might infect the wound…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Tell him that if I don’t stitch up her wound
she may bleed to death.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: If he doesn’t sew up the wound, she may bleed
to death.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: And tell him her clavicle is broken. We have
to fasten a splint to it.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: He says she has a broken bone and he has to
put a splint on it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We’re going to have to hold her down.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Honey, this is going to hurt a little.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Richard, don’t let him…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Don’t let him, don’t let him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Calm down… calm down… Susan, they have to
sew you up… relax…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, no…no..</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Honey, please try to relax…</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I don’t understand why Anwar brought them
here.</p>
<p><strong>friend 1</strong>: Well he spends all his time with them,
what do you expect.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: The woman is hurt, he had to help her.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Yeah? And when have they helped us?</p>
<p><strong>friend 1</strong>: I liked one of those tourists.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: Really? They’re all skin and bones.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Shh… sh… listen.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Today, near Tazarine, there was an
incident where an American was shot…</p>
<p><strong>friend 3</strong>: Hey look, it’s the story.</p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong>: They said Tazarine, did you hear? We were
on the radio…</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Shh, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Although authorities say it could have
been a foiled robbery, the American government claims they are certain
it was a terrorist attack. Minister Hassef Hazal has said that in our
country, terrorist cells have been eradicated, that Morocco is a
peaceful country and that one act of vulgar banditry followed by
superficial evaluations such as the U.S. intends to place upon it cannot
ruin the image, the economy and the pacifist reputation of our country.
American Ambassador Ken Jones, however, insists that it was a terrorist
attack on American citizens, that it merits a full investigation, and
that the guilty should be punished. So far, the attack has not been
attributed to any known terrorist organizations…</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I fucking told Anwar, I told him he was
only going to get us in trouble… he never comes and when he does he
always brings trouble…god damn it…</p>
<p><strong>friend 1</strong>: Are the Americans going to invade our
country?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I hate you… I hate you…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Tell her not to move; the bullet’s still
inside.</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: Don’t move, miss. The bullet is still inside
you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t give a shit…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: My love, don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I want to call the kids.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You can’t move, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I want to talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You can’t; there’s only one phone in town.
I’ll call them later.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I want to talk to them…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Could you please turn on the air
conditioning?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: No air condition, no gasoline near. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: My husband is feeling ill. You have to turn it
on.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: No possible. No gasoline near. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Please, it’s too hot. We can get
dehydrated.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I’m really sorry, forgive me, but gasoline
finish with air conditioner.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What is he saying?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That he can’t turn on the air conditioning,
that it’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fuck you. We’re gettin’ out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’ve gotta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You can’t leave us like this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: There are old people here and the heat is
getting to them.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: At least wait until an ambulance comes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: One man almost fainted in the bus and there’s a
woman who needs to get back in time to take her medication.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Is there anyone around here who can take
them in?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s not about that.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Sir, we can’t wait anymore.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We can’t leave him here alone.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well let him come, then.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: His wife is in no condition to ride a
bus.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: And lots of other people aren’t in any
condition to keep waiting, can’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Just wait, the ambulance should be here any
minute now.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’re giving you an hour… one hour…</p>
<p><strong>kumiko</strong>: They’re my cousins.</p>
<p><strong>chieko</strong>: Is he deaf-mute like us?</p>
<p><strong>kumiko</strong>: No, but he understands some.</p>
<p><strong>haruki</strong>: What’s your name?</p>

<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Is he armed?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: It doesn’t look like it.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: What are the others doing?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: A man is holding somebody
injured.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Is the other one still walking this way?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Aim.</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: I killed the American, I was the only one
who shot at you…</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: They did nothing… nothing…</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Kill me, but save my brother, he did
nothing… nothing…</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: On the ground…</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Save my brother…</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: On the ground…</p>
<p><strong>yussef</strong>: Save my brother… please…</p>
<p><strong>alarid</strong>: Go help them.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I can’t walk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: We have to keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why is the air so hot?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Because coyotes and snakes and quails have
already breathed that air.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’re breathing the same air animals
breathe?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: And it doesn’t rot?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No, it doesn’t rot. We all breathe this
air.</p>

<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No, there aren’t any. Come, lie down.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What happening?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Stay still.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why are we hiding if we didn’t do anything
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Because they think we did something
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That’s not true: you’re bad.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: No, sweetie, I’m not bad. I just did
something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I love you very much, sweetie.</p>

<p><strong>john</strong>: When did you cross?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I didn’t cross, I live here. Please, help me
find these kids.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stand there and don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Attention base, I have a 4533…I have the
suspect.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re under arrest. Turn around and put your
hands behind your head.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I left those kids in the desert, I
swear.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Turn around, now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Which way are they?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: They must be around here.</p>
<p><strong>eliseo</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This lady said they were here, but there’s
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>eliseo</strong>: Ma’am, you’re not lying to us, are you?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I swear they’re around here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: They must be over that way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s nobody here.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I left them about a kilometer in from the
road.</p>
<p><strong>eliseo</strong>: Which road?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I swear they’re around here.</p>
<p><strong>eliseo</strong>: John, wait, maybe she’s telling the
truth.</p>

<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Please sir, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I swear, they’re lost, they’re going to die.
I have to find them.</p>

<p><strong>susan</strong>: Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Richard… if I die, take care of the kids.
Especially Mike, he really needs you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re not going to die. You can’t die. You
just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Don’t ever leave them again.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, I’m not going to leave them and don’t
you even think about leaving me, because I’ll kill you like nobody’s
killed you before.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I peed my pants.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I couldn’t hold it in and I peed.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m going to tell Mike on you, so you never
scold him again.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I need to pee again.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Do you have a pot I can borrow?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Can you leave us alone for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come, try it like this.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Now I can.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Forgive me my love. When Pat died I didn’t
know what to do, the pain drove me crazy… I was scared, that’s why I
left… forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I was scared too… when I saw Pat lying still
in his crib…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It wasn’t my fault, it wasn’t… I couldn’t do
anything for him…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, it wasn’t your fault. I was wrong…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Shhh… it wasn’t your fault my love, it
wasn’t anybody’s fault… Pat just left… Forgive me, please.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Forgive me for not forgiving you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You missed; you got my leg.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: So much… so much…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Anwar…Anwar…</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’ve got to get her out of here. Where’s
the clinic?</p>
<p><strong>anwar</strong>: In Alnif, an hour and a half away from

<p><strong>richard</strong>: Can you get us a car we can take her
in?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: My love… I’m going to get you out of here.
We’re going to try to take you to a clinic an hour and a half away from
here. Do you think you can make it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I need you to be strong. Really strong.</p>

<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ahhh… Ahhh…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sweetie, you’ve got to hold on.</p>
<p><strong>tendero</strong>: Stop… Stop…</p>
<p><strong>tendero</strong>: They’re calling from the American
Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Just a moment, I’m going to put you
through to ambassador Ken Clifford.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Hello, Richard Jones?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, speaking.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: I’m very sorry about what happened to your
wife, but you can be sure that the culprits will be punished.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: My wife is dying. She’s in urgent need of
medical attention.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: We’re working on it…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’ve been here for five hours. What the
fuck are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: The Moroccan government won’t let us use their
airspace. They refused to acknowledge that this was an act of
terrorism…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I can’t wait anymore… I’m taking my wife to
a clinic in Tinerhir right now…</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Stay put… we’ve settled the matter. A
helicopter should arrive soon…</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We can’t wait any longer.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: The helicopter is on its way. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: My wife is in critical condition. How long
is the chopper going to take?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Soon… it’ll be there soon… Be patient, it won’t
be long.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Is your full name Amelia Gloria
Jord�n Susilla?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Do you understand English?</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Ma’am, it was a miracle that we
found those kids. I don’t know how you could leave them alone in the
desert.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I had to look for help.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Your reckless behavior endangered
their lives.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: How are they?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: That’s none of your business,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You’ve committed serious crimes.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I just took the kids to my son’s
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: No ma’am, you did not just do that.
You took them to another country without their parents’ permission and
you put them in danger.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: Sir, I raised these kids since they were
born. I take care of them day and night. I feed them breakfast, lunch
and dinner. I play with them. Mike and Debbie are like my own
children.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: But they are not your kids,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: What about my nephew, Santiago?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: I don’t have any information on
him.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: We located the parents in Morocco.
They’re very angry, but they’ve decided not to raise charges.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Nevertheless, the government of the

beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>amelia</strong>: I want to talk to a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: If you attempt to take this to

<p><strong>richard</strong>: Is she going to be ok?</p>
<p><strong>moroccan doctor</strong>: It’s probable. We’re going to try
to save her arm. She’s been bleeding internally, and there’s been some
clotting so there’s a high risk of gangrene.</p>

Ibrahim, who lives in southern Morocco?</p>

guide and I gave him the rifle. Hassan is a very kind man. Did anything
happen?</p>
<p><strong>kenji</strong>: There was an attempted murder with that
rifle, and the Moroccan police want to confirm it’s not off the black
market.</p>

<p><strong>kenji</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: Am I legally involved?</p>

testify for your friend.</p>

balcony. I’m very sorry.</p>

<p><strong>kenji</strong>: About how your wife killed herself by jumping
off the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>yasujiro</strong>: My wife never jumped off a balcony. She
shot herself in the head. My daughter was the first to find her.</p>

times. Don’t bother us with that anymore, please.</p>

anymore. Good night.</p>
