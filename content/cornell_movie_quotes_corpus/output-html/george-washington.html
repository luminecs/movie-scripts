<h1 id="george-washington">george-washington</h1>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: It’s just an advance party! Show some
guts! Damn it! Officers keep your men in line!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Sir, the wounded… up here!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Captain!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Hamilton, you’re going to have to cover
our asses as we cross.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: We’ve got powder but no ball!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Then use rocks!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We can’t take them. Are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: We’re leaving them?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They’re finished, they can’t help us
anymore! They’ve done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Yessir!</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: General it is against the law of God to
leave these men!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Is it? Then, by God, you stay with
them…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: C’mon, my brave boys! Get in these
boats! It’s these men or those wounded, reverend, and these men can
fight.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Those men did fight for you, sir!</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: We have come here to tear down the world!
Knock out its teeth! Smash its ribs! Rip out its heart and throw the
damn thing to the dogs!</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: You all know me. Governor Gage of
Massachusetts has called me ‘Sammy the Malster’! So, I accept his
christening: I stand before you, then, not as a delegate to the
Continental Congress, but as Sam Adams, Boston’s town drunk! Tonight I
am drunk on the beer of revolution!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, John Adams, your cousin has a
marvelous gift.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Yes, an astonishing power over weak
minds.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Horatio! Horatio Gates, of course you
know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.</p>
<p><strong>horatio gates</strong>: Good day, Mister Adams… George,
what’s the word from Boston?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The last I heard, a bunch of drunken
militia have dug in on Breed’s hill. With one stroke the British could
cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.</p>
<p><strong>horatio gates</strong>: Who’s in command out there?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Who the hell knows? Everyone’s giving
orders. It’s all very democratic.</p>
<p><strong>horatio gates</strong>: George, we’ve got to get you out
there before we lose our whole army.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: With your support, Horatio. As one of
our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: As does your ability, Horatio. We must
talk further, when it’s more convenient.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: This is The Great Chance! To make a world
where all men and all women may be equal, and may vote equally! Where we
of European stock may live in harmony with the natural natives of this
New World and learn from them…</p>
<p><strong>delegate 1</strong>: Learn what, Adams? How to steal cattle
and drink till you puke!?</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Why, no! You in Delaware are already
passing excellent at that!</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Joseph Reed, from Philadelphia; a first
class administrator George and he’s got a heart set on being your aide.
Pennsylvania has the wagons and teamsters you’ll need for an army, so
his importance goes beyond today’s vote. Ah! Joseph! Colonel Washington.
I’m extremely pleased to introduce you to Joseph Reed, one of
Pennsylvania’s most prominent citizens.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I hear Pennsylvania is the only northern
state that doesn’t do everything Massachusetts tells it.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: In that case sir, today will be that
exception.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We must talk at length, sir, when it’s
more convenient.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Colonel Washington? Colonel
Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Yes, yes, happy to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: I… I’m possessed of the idea of a
command in your army, sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: It isn’t my army yet, Colonel Greene.
Looks like you’ve seen some action – did you hurt your leg, in a
fight?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: I was born with a limp, sir. The
Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would
always sway…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: But, you do come from a military
family?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: I have commanded the Rhode Island
Militia for a year now. My father is an ironmaster. As was I.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: A horseshoer?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Yes, but I’ve spent the last
winter studying all the great battles of history. And I read the lives
of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal… Sir, I’m volunteering you the
wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Thank you Colonel Greene, for your
support. Colonel Washington will decide about his officers later. Thank
you…</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: You won’t be needing his largess, Rhode
Island is already committed to your appointment.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I don’t know: delivering men and
delivering men with their goodwill are two different things. And, if
he’s popular with his men…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Our new world is for the Black slave
forced by British greed to work like an animal! It is necessary that we
abolish this tyrannical practise once and for all! And not doing do, we
make a mockery of this whole business!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Gentlemen, gentlemen… It seems to me that
certain delegates here are demanding England grant us rights they’re not
willing to grant their own people.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Ben, you know many of us in Virginia,
including Thomas Jefferson, have tried to outlaw slavery. But the
Burgesses will not have it!</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Perhaps they would ‘have it’, Colonel
Washington, if those who proposed the laws in the first place set an
example. I should like to ask this question of your fellow delegate,
Thomas Jefferson, who is conveniently absent.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’s your argument, Franklin?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: My point being: we’ve been sharpening our
damned theories for years, but now reality is on us like the furies! Is
there truly support for war – all out bloody war! – for the nearly
intangible principles of the ‘rights of man’ that no one in this room
seems to be able to agree on? Or is this just some filthy scramble for
power?</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Colonel Charles Lee… Hounds and all.
Quite the character. He’s got a tremendous reputation.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I think many would like to see him
commander-in-chief.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Alas for Colonel Lee, he was born in
England, so no one quite trusts him. He’s not our problem, George. All
these men will fall into line, if Sam does. But Sam’s going to fight us,
he’s too powerful and too righteous not to. And he still wants Hancock
over you. Well, let me talk to him one last time…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: The child of a dock worker who dreams of
entering parliament, is beat down. A blacksmith’s son who would dream he
could become a governor, or a general, is beat down. Under the system of
the European Kings, all who dream are beat down… for centuries we have
been beat down! And now, we want a new world! So, today we must confront
the King, his lords and ladies and ministers and parliament and his
army… and kick them all in the rump!</p>
<p><strong>militia captain</strong>: Listen! Listen to me! Colonel
Benedict Arnold and Colonel Ethan Allen have taken Fort Ticonderoga! By
God, these be the British flags!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Captain, how did the British fight?</p>
<p><strong>militia captain</strong>: Fight? One man done got popped on
the head, then they fell on their knees and begged for mercy – The
British all be cowards.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Don’t you salute a superior officer?</p>
<p><strong>militia captain</strong>: You be from Virginia, Mister. I be
a New Hampshire man!</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if
you are going to join her for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to
stay a while longer.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Washington is perfect. He’s a
Southerner, he’s a war hero and he’s rich!</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: He’s from Virginia – there is no more
classist, elitist… English place on earth than Virginia. And, what in
hell has he done for our cause? Washington has been preaching
compromise, compromise, compromise! Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea
party! That’s why New England loves him.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Hancock led the Boston ‘tea party’
because he’s a goddamned tea smuggler! He wasn’t protesting inequality,
he was eliminating competition. Now, you listen to me: we need to get a
Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight! What
have we been struggling for all these years? For this moment! And, if we
fail now, remember: you stopped us!</p>
<p><strong>militia man</strong>: Who are you? Come forward! Why are you
traveling alone!?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Colonel Benedict Arnold. Connecticut
Militia, headed for Congress in Philadelphia…</p>
<p><strong>militia man</strong>: Colonel Arnold! The same who took
Ticonderoga?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: The very same.</p>
<p><strong>militia man</strong>: Well, sir. We are honored. Welcome to
Philadelphia…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: You are a slave owner! You have been
illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley! That land belongs to
the natives!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: That land belongs to the strongest.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: All people have rights!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Just because they are born?</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Who says so?</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: I say!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I see…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: And ‘others’, say… have you even read
Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Are these philosopher going to be here
to help you fight your war? You know why I don’t trust revolutions?
Because each of us is who we are: we make speeches, print pamphlets, and
we never change. The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister
Adams, it’s us. And, I don’t believe you can ever change human
nature.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Are you telling me that your opinion is
this revolution can never succeed?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Soldier! What’s all the shouting
about?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Boston! Boston! The British have attacked
the militia on Breeds Hill in Boston! It’s war! War!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I know a bit about you, too, Sam. To get
us here, you’ve lied, bullied… when there were no revolutionaries, you
hired thugs to riot and pretend they were. Now there are real
revolutionaries in Boston, and they’re really fighting. Why
hesitate?</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: That? I hear a mob: unemployed,
drunkards, vagabonds… the world’s dregs.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Well, I hear ‘The People’. Indentured
servants, freed slaves… escaped slaves. The world’s castaways. And, my
fear is, in the scramble for power that’s coming, you will betray
them.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Arnold! Benedict Arnold!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: We’ve got to attack the British! Now! Have
they put you in charge yet? Do we have an army yet? What is
happening?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Patience, Colonel Arnold. Active
personalities terrify these men. But, congratulations on your victory at
Ticonderoga…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Give me an hour to talk with the New
England delegates.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I believe we can bring the British to their
knees in a single stroke.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I capture Quebec leading an Army by river
fordings through Maine… If we don’t do it, the British will come down
Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You’d have to travel hundreds of miles
through the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Over three hundred miles.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You seem pleased by the prospect.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Exceedingly. Besides, if I had half the
wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress,
I could move a whole army to the moon!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What’s your frank estimation of the
British?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, you fought with them against the
French and Iroquois, how good were they then?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They died well. Otherwise, they didn’t
do much right. But if we have war, the British will surely send their
best troops: right now they have no other enemies.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: And a French alliance?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Ben Franklin’s going to Paris, but I
think the French will be long on talk and short on guns. Our troops are
mobs, they won’t take orders, have no equipment… could they beat the
British?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: It comes down to leaders. If our leaders are
ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the
troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die? The most
common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: My experience is, the ones who know the
least will be the bravest.</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: It’s time, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: New Hampshire; Massachusetts; Rhode
Island; Connecticut; New York; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; Delaware;
Maryland; Virginia; North Carolina; South Carolina; Georgia…</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: There is a gentleman among us whose
skill and experience as an officer, whose independent fortune, great
talents and excellent universal character, command the approbation of
all America. I speak of Virginia Delegate and Militia Colonel, George
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: It’s another demonstration against the
king. This is the wildest yet.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: My God, these people mean to go to war! They
really mean it.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Surely you knew this was coming.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: War? No! I did not! When you said compromise
was possible I believed it was probable. There’s no middle ground at
all? We’re the King’s children!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Our beloved father, the King, also
refuses to bend.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: But to go to war over trade, over money?
Surely there’s still time for a compromise.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Of course, if it were that simple. These
people? They’re after something else…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: My God, what?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The eternal dream of the
disenfranchised, my dear: a classless world. Not a very real
expectation.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well, a very real expectation is the British
will hang you! They’ll burn Mount Vernon and they’ll hang you! Our
marriage is a business just as surely as…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’m very aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I can not allow the fortune in slaves my
first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be
destroyed…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous, of course that
won’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Have you been reading what Minister
Jefferson has to say? If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed
no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a
British victory.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I’ll
ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule. Tom Jefferson
is one of those people who talks big and acts small. The only man out
there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he’s
crazy. Believe me, this ‘disturbance’ isn’t going to last long. You have
to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each
and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And, what ‘prize’ do you see? What could we
possible gain?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Everything. If we force Britain into
concessions it will open up the western lands – and that would be a boon
for our family. We already have more slaves than we need, but we need
more land.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And, if after all this is over and the
‘disenfranchised’ want the freedom you and everyone else promised them?
Our lives, our fortunes, my children’s future depends on our slaves.
George, freed slaves are in the streets demonstrating!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: When my mother married my father, she
believed she had fulfilled her dream of marrying ‘up’, like a child’s
dream of going to heaven… Yet the truth is, she just pulled my family
down. So, I’m still seen as the badly-bred, half-educated son of a
failed landowner and a social climbing barmaid… Each of us – Jefferson,
John Adams… each of us has found a way to climb over the barriers that
keep us from real power… everyone is finding a way to the top in this
crisis. The south trusts me because I’m one of their own as a slave
owner, land owner, I’ll protect their ‘rights’; the north because – they
claim – I am about to lead an army in a fight for absolute freedom… Or
at least the right to absolute free trade. So, when it’s over, we will
be positioned very, very well indeed.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: But, as usual, it will not go well for…
them. Martha, you must trust me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’re no fool, George. You never have
been.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: “Liberty, Virtue, Country”… That’s from
Cato… you know, that play about the noble Romans? As I was riding up to
Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: When you lived with the Fairfaxes?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: When I was a young man we used to recite
Cato… We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.
Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart… Purity of heart. I was drunk
on something then…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That’s when Sally Fairfax was tutoring
you…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And have you heard anything from our dear
friend, Sally? What with all the rumors getting back to England. I
thought she might inquire after us. But then I believe she always looked
down on us.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>king’s secretary</strong>: “General Washington is a man of
means. Not only does he risk all but has insisted that he serve without
salary; a noble gesture.” So says the Times.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: When you’re rich you can afford to be
noble. The American’s battle cry is ‘the rights of man’ – God help us!
Tell me, Cornwallis, what the hell are we fighting for?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: We fight for the glory of England,
sire.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: What!? Are you out of your mind?
Savages fight for glory – I’ll tell you what we fight for:</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Cotton, from Egypt. Asian silk… Indian
copper… African silver. Shit, you’re a walking advertisement for empire
now aren’t you, General? Commerce is empire! The British East India
Company against the French and Dutch East India Companies. Hudson’s Bay
Company against the French West India Company… we live in a world run by
empires of companies. And, what we mean to resolve is: who owns the
greatest repository of raw materials the world has ever seen. I’ll tell
you, it had better be us! If these stupid people gain independence they
could trade resources for immense power…</p>
<p><strong>king’s secretary</strong>: “We must recall that General
Washington is one of our own. An aristocrat, a lord over vast lands, a
slave holder…” So says the News…</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: He’s not a ‘general’; he’s a disloyal
subject! So, shut up! This is the most… ghastly… occurrence… in the
whole history of mankind. These people have gone completely berserk! I
am descended from God! God! Clearly, they want to wage war against
God!</p>
<p><strong>lord germain</strong>: Our army sailing for New York is over
thirty thousand strong.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Thirty thousand! You hear that,
Cornwallis!?</p>
<p><strong>lord germain</strong>: That is, my Lord, the largest single
overseas force this nation has ever dispatched.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Our plan is to come down from Canada by
boat on Lake Champlain; beats walking. Should get us into Ticonderoga
right on schedule. Then, if our New York campaign doesn’t completely
crush Washington before winter, by spring, our two armies will link up
and… it will be over.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Except for a lovely series of treason
trials. Should we bring Washington to England?</p>
<p><strong>lord germain</strong>: Not if you want him to hang –
Parliament will likely make him their darling and pardon him. Turn him
over to the American Congress; they’ll hang him to save their own
necks!</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Let’s hear more! Come on, come on!</p>
<p><strong>king’s secretary</strong>: “Washington’s distinguished
himself during the so-called ‘French and Indian War’. Fighting with
Braddock he had two horses shot from under him, several bullets pierced
his coat – yet he was never scratches. Savages who fought against
Washington that day claim he is under an eternal spell of a protecting
manitou. They believe the gods have preserved him for eternity…” So says
the Guardian.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: General Cornwallis, I want you to
punish these criminals, and this peculiar Mister Washington…</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Fifteen hundred killed, wounded or
missing in battle. Three thousand men taken prisoner when the Hudson
forts surrendered. Another one thousand five hundred lost to desertion.
And more than two thousand lost on our retreat… because their
enlistments expired.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Any word from Canada?</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Spies from Quebec confirm that the
British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: A fleet?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: How could they get a fleet onto
Lake Champlain? It’s landlocked!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: General, the enemy sailed the ships in
from England, took them apart plank by plank and rebuilt them on the
lake. They have bomb ships, mortar barges, the ship-of-the-line
Inflexible… altogether it is estimated a fleet of some thirty or more
ships. The Iroquois have joined them with one hundred war canoes
carrying more than a thousand Mohawk sharp-shooters.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: My God… They mean to finish us. What
about Arnold? He’s up there.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: What can he do? The British have
massive superiority.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: I doubt Arnold will be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: If he isn’t, then he’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Did God ever make such a pitiful
army?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: These men have suffered but I
believe they will fight.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: No officer is going to get these men to
fight! They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the
most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to
protect Congress.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: I hear General Lee is holding
seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York – why won’t he come
on!?</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: General Lee is detained captain…</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Detained by what?</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: The British army, sir!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: The British Army is right back
there, across that river! Sir! I think it must be something else that
detains General Lee.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Gentlemen! Nathanael, would you have one
of your men prepare a bodyguard for Colonel Reed. Joseph, get to
Congress… Here is a list of supplies in detail. If Congress has to
divert food, weapons and powder from the troops around Philadelphia,
then I order them to do so. I’m also ordering any free troops to join
our forces here as fast as possible. That includes General Lee. Tell him
he can bring his damned dogs, but tell him to get here.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’m ordering that Negroes be allowed to
join the army.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Congress is bitterly opposed to
allowing Negroes in the army!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: We already have black soldiers in
our army…</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Unofficially, General Greene.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: If we’re going to last the winter I need
men! Make Congress understand that two powerful British armies are going
to converge on this spot come spring. One from the north and one right
across that river.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: General Greene, will you please see to
that bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: If we have any hope for a compromise or
truce with England now, we have to hold on here: our men must believe
they can win – the British must believe that somehow, in some mad,
impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: I understand, George.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You are officers! Officers! Come to
attention! What is your regiment!?</p>
<p><strong>maryland officer</strong>: I’m from Maryland, sir! That scum
sucker from Connecticut…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You both are under arrest!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: GUARD!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Mutiny and you will be shot!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Ready!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You are all soldiers in the American
Army, you are no longer just state militia! Get that through your thick,
backwoods skulls! You all signed up for an enlistment, and you will stay
or be shot as deserters! Any man caught rioting will earn himself fifty
lashes! Any man convicted of mutiny will receive one hundred and
fifty!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The only way to get discipline into
these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Sir, Congress hasn’t issued their
pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.
You’re being a little hard on them, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred
to being a gentleman – unlike these men – his sense of duty naturally
prevails over the baser needs.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Well sir, I was an ironmaster
before you got me. Maybe I will let you down yet.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I certainly didn’t mean you. Of course
you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: You wrong me, general; I am an
officer and a horse-shoer.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: How old are you, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: I’ll be twenty next year, sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’ll expect you for dinner this evening,
Captain Hamilton. For Christ’s sake, have a bath.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Delighted, sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I have just heard that General
Cornwallis is being recalled back to England. He’s leaving with his wife
for an extended… vacation. I assume this means we are no longer
feared.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: In the north General Arnold with a
handful of badly supplied men is all that stands between us and a second
British army. Come Spring the British will be unstoppable. So, my
question to you is: retreat, fight, or dig-in and prepare for whatever
may come at us in the Spring. Each of you has command of a body of men,
you should know their spirit. What do you say? Speak up! I want to know
what you really think!</p>
<p><strong>tubby officer</strong>: If I’m to judge from the mood of my
men…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>tubby officer</strong>: Well then, retreat.</p>
<p><strong>lean officer</strong>: Retreat and fall back on Congress. If
we can save Philadelphia and our political leaders the British will have
to negotiate a peace.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: We must fight! – fight! – fight!!! Attack
them wherever they hide! Burn their fleets, massacre their armies –
drive them off the continent!</p>
<p><strong>tubby officer</strong>: How many men in your command,
Captain?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Five, sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: General Greene?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: I’m with Captain Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Yes, I thought that’s how you’d feel,
Nathanael.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do
you feel?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: No one wants to turn the table on the
enemy more than I. But if victory is remote and there’s any hope for a
negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Therefore, retreat.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’m so inclined.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Well, sir, then is it possible you called
us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I am open to your strategies,
captain.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Well, sir, my strategy would be to arm
people who want freedom and have them attack people who want to enslave
them.</p>
<p><strong>lean officer</strong>: Which is exactly why no damned Negros
should be allowed in our armies!</p>
<p><strong>tubby officer</strong>: Ridiculous! New England has had
African men in her Militias for years. You southerners are just a’feared
‘cause you’re slave owners. Beggin’ your pardon, sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I want to remind you all that black
minutemen fought alongside white troops at Lexington and Concord. Not in
separate divisions – they fought together. Black and white troops also
fought together at the battles of Breed’s and Bunker Hill. It was a
black sharpshooter who killed the British field commander, Major
Pitcairn.</p>
<p><strong>lean officer</strong>: A lucky shot!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We could use some luck!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: What are we going to do then,
General? Retreat further or…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: After giving the question careful
consideration I must agree with Colonel Reed’s original assessment: our
troops are too dispirited for a counter-attack. For the present, we’ll
continue our retreat toward Newtown.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Sir, what am I going to tell my men?</p>
<p><strong>lean officer</strong>: You tell them to march! All five of
them!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: General Washington, is there actually
going to be a compromise, I mean, a ‘deal’ with England?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: And is that the most horrible thing in
the world?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Captain, I want you to know that I
respect your openness. It would make me happy if you’d join our table
for dinner from now on.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: With pleasure… and an honor. Did you hear
about Nathan Hale?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: That young school teacher… I heard the
British hung him as a spy.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: But it’s what he said, just before they
killed him: “I regret that I have but one life to give to my
country.”</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Yessir. I am first lieutenant Birdie
McMullen. Jimmy – my best rifleman – done shot a big buck, sir. And our
company of New Hampshire volunteers is offerin’ it for your table.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, we have no table, but… come on
closer.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Thank you men, I accept.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: We’ll dress it for you sir. Be ready in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: George! George, here she is; George, the
prize of my heart! This is Sally Cary! Now, Mrs. Sally Fairfax.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: So, you are William’s wild young neighbor? Or
should I say, ‘brother’; William claims you as a member of his family. I
have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that
except for you, this ‘family’ is quite cultivated.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: George, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh, but you must not mind my talking about
you! In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize
you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s not what I said! Now, Sally, you’re
embarrassing me! Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but
she has a barbarous soul!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: “Let no torrent of impetuous zeal transport
thee beyond bounds of reason: True fortitude is seen in great exploits
that justice warrants and wisdom guides.”</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: “All else is tow’ring frenzy and
distraction.” George? It’s your line…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Ah… “Pity that I have but one life
to lose for my country…”</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hey – that’s my line! Why, I think George
is infatuated with you, Sally.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t tease George.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I’m sorry, I am hopelessly
lost…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The land here is best for grain and
corn.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Though, sometimes we get frost and
that can cut the season.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s marvelous. To see wealth pour forth from
the land.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: A bounty from the bosom of heaven.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: We can grow three primary crops in a season
and, if we have some luck, we get a forth. The temperature is generally
mild.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Except for that, quite like home; England,
that is.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hear that, George? Sally’s actually taken
to thinking of this clod of earth as her home. And it’s her first tour.
We’re gratified, aren’t we George?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Of course we have slaves here instead of
tenant farmers to make the land pay. Our harvest is about fourteen
percent higher this year.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Oh, dear…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Are you well, Sally?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: God’s sake, Sally…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: We’re almost away from here.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The crowding is hard to bear, but in the
fall we consolidate the work camps. Sally?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: It’s the wealth of the land, Mrs. Fairfax.
The slaves and indentured servants. It’s part of the system of
Virginia’s wealth.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Come on, Sally, we have so much more to
see. Show a little mettle!</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Damn it, William! Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, George, we’re going on then. Stay
with her a bit, all right? There’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I should take you right back to
Belvoir.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Where… do those men come from, George?</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Africa, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Africa? That’s so far? How do they get
here?</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Slavers capture them and bring
them here.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Capture them? Well, I’ve never seen anything
like it, so… of course I’m curious.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Sally, our slave system is a
British law…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Did I say anything? We must be… who we must
be.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I shan’t break.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: The word ‘minuet’ finds its source in
minitus, which is Latin meaning ‘small’ or ‘orderly’.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Or, ‘civilized’.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: In the minuet, George, every movement is
significant, like the strut of cranes…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Cranes? Who needs to walk like a
crane?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That’s just my interpretation. Actually it’s
a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see? Walk in a
gently ‘Z’. There are four distinct movements…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I’ve seen them do this.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s less a true dance than an expression of
polite deportment…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: What do you really think of the
minuet, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s stupid, of course.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Then why are you teaching me…?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it. You
asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum… as I said, it’s
completely stupid.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Stupid tea time…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What attracts me and frightens me about
America… it’s the wildness that’s so different from England, from
English culture. That’s what it’s about back there: insulating yourself
from whatever might really touch you. Anything you can heap between you
and… that.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Well, you get storms in
London.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No, we have weather. Sometimes, if things get
completely out of hand, we have actual gusts. But we never, ever allow
this to happen.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I always though London was the
place to be: capital of the world, the most spectacular city on
earth.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: The place to want to be is America. Every
English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I think America suits you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Do you? When I saw those men yesterday in the
field… and the women and children in those hovels? I’m not so sure if
America is as far from England as I’d hoped.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: It’s the freest land on earth.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Is it? Well, I’m scared of what we’ve become
in our freedom.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Well, we must be who we must
be…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And to think I am teaching you to become one
of them…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: What else should I become? There’s
no difference between Virginia and England. I must be educated if I’m to
take my place in society. My father couldn’t afford to send me to
England for school – he made a shambles of our fortunes. Everyone laughs
at me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I don’t laugh at you, George. I like you. I
like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat… and
that’s because you’re completely incompetent at hiding your
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I think I will disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh, George, I think you and I have very
little control over what we are going to do…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, for your
entertainment and elucidation, our unpretentious company of dramaturgic
artisans, presents that Tale of the celebrated protector of Rome. The
man who dared resist the wretched tyrants Crassus, Pompey, and Caesar in
his fatal fight to uphold the Roman Senate and save sacred democracy: We
give you Joseph Addison’s Cato… My lovely wife herself plays Marcia,
daughter of Cato, young George Washington, Numidia’s hero Juba! And I,
myself, ever your humble servant, as Cato!</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Let’s get you darker!</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: You’re out of your mind!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Why? Juba was an African and you want to look
the part – hold still.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: They can use their
imaginations.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Those people? I doubt they’d think of this.
Ooo, you’re wonderful this color!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Behold! Juba of Numidia! African warrior and
defender of liberty!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’ve been surprised in an unguarded hour, But
must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast,
has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full
lustre. I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I’m lost in ecstasy! And dost thou
love, Thou charming maid?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And dost thou live to ask it?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: My daughter, I ask only…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: This, this is life indeed! Life
worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Juba, thy arm! Oh, let me rest upon it – The
vital blood that had forsook my heart, Returns again in such tumultuous
tide, It quite o’ercomes me. Lead me to my apartment!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: ’Tis true, ofttimes…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I am so blest I fear ’tis all a
dream. Fortune, thou now hast made amends for all Thy past unkindness; I
absolve my stars. Juba will never at his fate repine; Let Caesar have
the world, if Marcia’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: For God sake, get that horrid stuff off
your face. You look like a damned slave! It’s damned humiliating.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Juba was a Numidian.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: He was not black! He was… tan!
Weathered!</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: I see, so if you squint hard
enough, Juba of Numidia becomes an Englishman?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Come on! It’s our second bow! Weren’t we
wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Think what the play means, William. Perhaps
these words have a place in the real world.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Words, words, words! Sally has been
tutoring George in the philosophies, isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: William, we’ve been studying hard,
I really know my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Don’t be silly, you have whole worlds to
fathom.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Remember, George, “It is dangerous to be
right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: That’s good… who?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Voltaire, of course…</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: “I can be expected to look for
truth but not find it.” Diderot.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Ah! Well, here’s my Diderot: “I have only a
small flickering light to guide me in the darkness of a thick forest. Up
comes a theologian and blows it out.”</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Come now, that’s not philosophy it has no
context. Philosophy is the thinnest, most concisely rendered portion of
the whole of life as can possibly be embraced by the cognizant spirit of
the Christian mind.</p>
<p><strong>young washington</strong>: Voltaire says: “When he who hears
doesn’t know what he who speaks means, and when he who speaks doesn’t
know what he himself means – that is philosophy.”</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well, I think George has got it!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: George, would you be so kind as to see
Sally home? Yes, and here’s a challenge for you both – and I’ll bet you
can’t beat it – walk all the way home speak not one single word!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches,
position, land, even half-grown children. You won’t have to do anything
at all! You shan’t have to do another thing to prove yourself.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You know very well who it is that I
love.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Is that the truth? Well, we can’t carry on
like animals any longer.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: George, you know I only love you, but…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: But not more than your comfort.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And what is this, then? Been off to fight the
French because you are a patriot? Or is this you, gaining your long
sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: That’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Is it? William says now you have requested a
British Commission, why not colonial? I’ll clear it up for you, sir,
because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels – more
than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come
true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Perhaps you’ve been counting my acres,
Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Now that is a lie! See how much you want to
create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society
laid at your feet! When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis,
I’ll divorce William! Do you hear? You get what you want from this
world, then throw it all away on love!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’d throw everything away for you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You remember, George, when we were ‘studying’
the great philosophers?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I remember a pair of young philosophers
once, who laughed at the world.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well, I remember a philosopher who said
something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class
denouncements… but which I now see means us all.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Really? Which precious homily was
it?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: “Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is
in chains…”</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Arnold!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’ve come to report that we’ve had a bit of
luck!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: General Arnold attacked the whole
British fleet on Lake Champlain – and he stopped them!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: He attacked them with old converted barges
and fishing boats – and he stopped them!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I anchored those tubs in the lee of Valcour
island, spread them in a crescent to concentrate their fire. The British
sailed around the island and we bushwhacked ’em! In the end, of course,
they were too strong for us, but we hurt them and we delayed ’em long
enough. When they realized they’d have to conquer Ticonderoga in the
dead of winter. Well, they packed everything up and sailed back to
Canada. So, we had some luck.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Damn-it! You’ve given us a whole new
season, Benedict! And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride
right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Congress has picked up it’s skirts and is
racing for Baltimore. They’re not waiting for spring! Of course, they
still had time to deny my promotion. Even John Adams voted against
it…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Why in hell would John do that? Why in
hell would any of them do that? After all you’ve done, it’s
unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Oh, they have reasons… there’s a lot of
confusion these days.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They don’t trust me, that’s the truth
isn’t it? Sam Adams never did.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: But trust you to do what? One side in
Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender –
some, of course, just want power and money. But if you don’t mind my
asking, George, what are your plans?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We’re in bad shape, Benedict, moral is
low. Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.
I’ve ordered him to join us three times. In my last letter I all but
begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: The man’s waiting for you to get wiped off
the stage so he can become commander and chief.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What else? Come on, Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Colonel Reed’s returned, sir. Says he
brings greetings from Congress. And a scout’s come in from New
Jersey…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’ll be along presently.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Go on… I want to hear everything.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Congress is talking – openly – about
replacing you with Lee.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Is that a fact.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: But it was General Washington who
sent you north and you were victorious.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: No, no! Congress says that I failed and that
George is responsible.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: What do you think, George, shall I resign?
It’s what they want.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Don’t do anything rash, please,
Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: They’re just disgusting, jealous,
bottom-feeding swine. It’s their nature.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You have a free tongue, Captain
Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The army needs you.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: The army can survive without me.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Then, I need you. We all do. Without
your victory the men would have no hope at all.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Someday, George, you may need to act for the
good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is. It may come
down to us, or them someday. You or them. Cicero was right: was is ‘a
time when the laws are silent’.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I hope I never have to believe that.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Christ, George, Joseph Reed’s been writing
letters back to Congress attacking you. Your own aide!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Make yourself at home, Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Say, are there any women in this town?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Colonel Reed…</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: George! So good to be back!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: That damned Arnold is here, isn’t he?
Did you know he lost all his ships? Outrageous and completely
unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Joseph, the British spent thousands of
pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped
by sacrificing a heap of old barges. In my opinion he saved my army.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Well, George, Congress just passed a
resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I
wouldn’t cast my fate with that man.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: The winds of change are blowing fierce,
George! Congress is making marvelous friends. A whole grand scheme is
being forged that will finally set this country right.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: A grand scheme?</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: A ground swell-Christian movement,
George, you see?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: No. As a matter of fact I haven’t the
slightest idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: To assert the rights of our founding
fathers! This country was colonized by Christians! This shall become a
Christian revolution. Surely as a good Christian you understand
that!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Sir! Cornwallis has moved a whole German
mercenary army into Trenton.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Hessians! That’s right across the river
from us! Right there! And behind them, a days march, is the whole
British Army. Sir, we are kicked out of New Jersey forever! Blocked from
ever returning to New England!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: We are not blocked! Except by the congress
and their lack of support!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: That will do, Captain Hamilton!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Be careful of that one. He’s a Jew, you
know. Yes, it’s true! The bastard son of some Jewess, and a drunken
peddler. No wonder he identifies with these creatures.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Look at these people! They must be
freezing. Hard to imagine why they stay at all. Do you think it’s got to
do with the animal in their nature? I mean to say, this class of mankind
is half way between Negroes and real humans. As half animals, perhaps
the elements don’t bother them so much. That’s why we must make us a
purely Christian land…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’m not a Christian, Joseph. So please,
let’s not insult one another by continuing this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: What do you mean you’re not a
Christian? Of course you’re a Christian, we’re all Christians…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I mean, I’m a Deist. A belief I share
with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin. Surely you knew
that.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: No, I did not. Really? Well, what the
hell is a deist, precisely?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: One who believes that God sent this
world spinning, then got the hell out of the way, just to see what
mankind would do to itself.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Some say that Hessians are invincible.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: They always say that.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They’re among the best divisions the
British have. No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional
killers.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: It’s a wonder they find the British cause
worth dying for.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, now there’s something worth dying for.
What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Hmmm… she’s beneath me, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I wish she was beneath me.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Unfortunately, I’ll never get the chance.
I’m leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin
about my promotion. Wasting my time, naturally… Look at her teasing
those bumpkins.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: What does she see in them?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, as any farmer knows, a jenny
always enjoys being penetrated by a disproportionately sized
jackass.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: After visiting Congress I know what it’s
like being violated by come disproportionate asses! Ah, if she only knew
that the most important men in the country – possibly the world – are
sitting at this table…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We’re so damned important! Look at us –
Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, truth be told? I was a pharmacist.
Alexander?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: I was a clerk’s apprentice on Saint Croix.
But, then I went to King’s College.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: To learn to shoot cannon?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, George, who were you?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I? You all know my history.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Sir, if you don’t mind my saying,
I don’t understand your history at all. I mean, why would you want to
win the war? You’re not after glory, like Benedict… You’re a slave
owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You don’t believe I can fight from a
sense of duty and patriotism?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: No. We’re all of us after
something. It’s easy for me to fight for the common man. My father could
only dream that I would be… a general someday? And what of my daughter
or son? I know what I’m after. But now, with all this talk about
compromise? It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common
man has no hope.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I will not betray you, Nathanael.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: But you are an aristocrat and a
slave owner. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: At one time I could have chosen not to
be.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Then, maybe I do see what you’re
after – perhaps… you get to chose again…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Major, who are you? Your orders,
please.</p>
<p><strong>continental major</strong>: Done got no orders sir… we’re
General Lee’s division.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What? Where is General Lee? Who ordered
you to march here?</p>
<p><strong>continental major</strong>: Nobody done. The British done
captured General Lee in a New Jersey whore house… then, well, we
couldn’t find nobody home down at Congress so we come to see you. Ain’t
this where the war be?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Yes! This is where the war be! I’ll bet
you men could use some hot rum!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Trenton!? But the enemy is there!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: But the Hessians are there! No one can
beat them! That’s why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the
post of honor! They are invincible!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They are also very religious. So, we
will attack them three days from now, on Christmas. One force under me,
and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader…</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: George, I’m afraid if you go through
with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where
we’re headed, you’re putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and
Arnold…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: How many generals do we have like
Arnold? He’s got guts – he’s vain, and he fights!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: And, Hamilton? Greene?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They help me understand why we
fight.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Understand? You need to be listening to
people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country
first in your mind!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Joseph, are you afraid to cross that
river with me? I accept your resignation. With regret. You have leave to
return to Philadelphia…</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: We’ve come for the password,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: ‘Victory or death’, tell everyone. In
two hours I will address the men.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Today your country and I, your
commander, ask you to be brave. On Christmas day we are going to cross
back over the Delaware River, into New Jersey and attack the German
mercenary forces at Trenton. These men are the best the British have
got. But the Germans are good Christians and as it’s still Christmas,
I’m betting they’re still a little drunk when we pay our visit.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Of course, they’re not expecting us to
come back for a visit, but as it’s Christmas, and we being good hosts,
we wouldn’t think of letting another day pass without dropping by and
exchanging musket and cannon balls with them. But to make this party a
success, I must ask each and every one of my soldiers – no matter where
in America you are from – to work for the good of the whole. Cooperate,
listen to your officers and remember that this is a surprise party so
for God’s sake, keep quiet!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We’ve had some hard luck. But that’s
changing. If you value your freedom, be brave. I have here a poem that
was taken from the journal of a Hessian Major at the battle of Long
Island describing our army: “The rebel clowns, oh what a sight, So
awkward was their figure. ’Twas yonder stood a filthy wight, And here
and there a nigger.”</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Ice ahead!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Just a little music, boys!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Shell ice, sir…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We can’t see ahead, General.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We can’t see going back, either.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: What if the others turn back?</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: I don’t see any other boats!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Steady men. It won’t be long now.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Keep rowing!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: I can’t hear their oars. We’re alone…
they’ve all turned back!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: God they turned back! Colonel Cadwalader
turned back!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Come on boys, the rest of the army is
still here! Row, damn-it! Row!</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: My Lord! My Lord!</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: My Lord, Washington has attacked Trenton!
The whole Hessian army is prisoner!</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: My God, we have a hero on our hands!</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Let’s not over do it…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: I tell you every damned place I go the
man is adored! “General Washington! Champion of Trenton! Savior of the
Republic!” And you should hear the way people are deprecating
Congress!</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Makes you gag.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Gag on your own invention, then.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Oh, come now…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: You invented this, this…</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: This ‘king’…</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: You think that?</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: He has the soul of an aristocrat who’d
like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Cornwallis left last night by forced march for
Trenton! He has a huge force – as we speak – he’s maneuvering to trap
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: As we speak? Does the Congress know? Tell
us when you hear for certain.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: No one wants another failure right now,
God knows. But people like Arnold and, God knows, I’m having my fears
about General Washington.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Finally!? It’s people like these who, as
soon as they get a little power, want more and more. More ale, here!</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Again, just to touch on a touchy
subject, but… would the people accept another leader over
Washington?</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: It sounds like after today, they may
not have that choice.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I know how you feel – I do! We all want
to go home! I know your enlistments are up, but we beat the Hessians,
boys! We can beat them again!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Cornwallis is coming here now, you
licked his best troops! He’s scared boys! Are we just going to hand him
back all we’ve won? Come on! Come forward! Who will volunteer to save
America? Do it for me, boys!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’ll offer ten dollars a man who will
stay beyond the end of his enlistment. Ten dollars! Just to stay one
month beyond his time! One month!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: If this army goes home before its
business is finished, then your comrades died for nothing! I’m begging
you!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Will we attack tonight, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: I don’t want my tired men fighting this
dark. Listen, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: They’re digging in. That’s my man.
Predictable… to the end.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: My God! My God! My God!</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: My God, what?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Washington! He out flanked Cornwallis in the
night, attacked the British army at Princeton!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: At Princeton, he rallied the entire American
Army in the face of death!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Every enemy sniper was shooting at him! But he
never got a scratch!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: It’s a miracle! A miracle!</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Gentlemen, it’s not a hero, we have on
our hands; it’s a god!</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: No uniforms. No coats, even? In this
weather?</p>
<p><strong>mawhood</strong>: No, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: What sort of boots would you say he’s
wearing? I should say, no sort of boots at all. Aren’t those rags
wrapped around his feet? Is that what he marched here in?</p>
<p><strong>mawhood</strong>: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: And, is that a pitchfork beside him?</p>
<p><strong>mawhood</strong>: Many of them, many did not possess proper
arms. My lord.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Negroes? Washington has black men in his
army? Are they good fighters? What’s that red ribbon on his arm,
Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>mawhood</strong>: Because they have hardly any uniforms, they
designate officers with colored ribbons. My lord.</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: By red, what rank would you say this
black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>mawhood</strong>: I, don’t know what color is what officer,
my lord…</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: But not a general, surely?</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Where have all my champions gone? My
Gawain? Galahad? Who among my nobles will defend the realm? I am
bleeding for some pure man, some virtuous poet to do us this great
service… for our country. For our kind.</p>
<p><strong>general burgoyne</strong>: I am that man, My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: What do these people want, General
Burgoyne? Right? Unqualified natural freedom? There is no such stupid
state of being. The Garden of Eden? Is that what they think they’ve
found? Man is an animal whose natural states is that of unremitting
barbarism. They steal from each other; they kill each other; they even
eat each other! Without the structure of an enlightened, ruling class,
they will plummet into a hell of greed. Where, in the end, they will
simply rename something else, ‘upper class’.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: When in the Course of human events, it
becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which
have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the
earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of
Nature’s God entitle them…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: A decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to
the separation.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We hold these truths to be self evident,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life. Liberty, and
the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Go forth and sin no more… go forth and sin
no more… go forth…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a
law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the
church?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I think I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot
believe you are so calm about it!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What else? From Virginia?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t want to trouble you with
this now.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Martha… what?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Virginia is outraged with your order
allowing Negroes to fight in the army. There’s a deep feeling of hurt
and betrayal. They wanted you commander because they expected you would
look out for our interests.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: To win this war I need an army.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, indeed? You know very well people are
frightened of arming the Negroes! They beg you to consider the future.
What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What’s the point of a revolution if it
doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Some things must never change.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Is that why you come in here tossing
pennies to my starving men? It’s damned condescending!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Don’t condescend to me! We have both of us
prospered from the arrangements of our kind…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Our ‘kind’? What is that supposed to
mean? These men are all I have left and they stay because they will
fight! They desire it! They seek it! Of course Virginia is terrified!
For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the ‘upper class’ from the
face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win
it will ruin me!? It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are
fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they
will own this country too!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.
One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been
interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Martha! For God’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Leave me, now sir, I am tired.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Come out and meet my soldiers. They’re
good people.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I want you to see our hospital.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I don’t want to see your hospital.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Wil! What the hell are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: My God, have you been drinking!?</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: You, you just need a new flint,
General.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You are never, never to touch my guns!
Do you understand!?</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Yes, General. But if you have to shoot
somebody, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: None of the servants is to touch a gun!
You know that!</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Well… I misunderstood, then.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Misunderstood what!?</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: A lot of years have gone by.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: That you would have known you can trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’m sorry, Wil.</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Me? You apologizing to me?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Yes, William. I am apologizing.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Good afternoon, mon general, I am the
Marquis de Lafayette. I am here both as an official and unofficial
emissary of his Majesty Louis VI, King of France. I have been
commissioned major general in the American army… by Congress, in that
capacity I am but a humble volunteer in your army…</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: However, through my relations with
members of his majesty’s court, I am a representative of the French
government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our
American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George
of England. Vive la France! Vive l’Amerique!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We have more officers created by
Congress than we know what to do with.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: But, general, I assure you my motives are
sincere.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Sir, please accept my commission from
Congress… and… You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife,
Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.
Her name is Henriette…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What I want to know is sir: where is
your daddy?</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: My father died when I was a tiny child.
He was killed at the battle of Minden – in Europe. He was fighting
against the British troops led by Lord Germain – the present advisor to
King George. I assure you that from that day forward I have been a
man.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Gentlemen, my I introduce a French
gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress… Marie Joseph
Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General
Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen,
and… how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Uh… none just now, but…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Now, news about what has been holding up
the shipment of coats for the men. It seems they are done but have no
buttons because Congress is debating over what the buttons should say on
them. But, they’re anxious to know what we think. Some suggestions are:
“Unity and Peace”; “Freedom and Peace”; “Unity, Freedom and Peace”;
“Christ’s Army”; “God’s Army”; “Don’t Tread on Us”; and “The Holy
Alliance of Mankind and Christ made Manifest On Earth”, which would be a
very large button, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Now, the questions of boots… they were
produced at enormous expense by a ‘friend of Congress’, crated, and –
just before they were to be brought here – they vanished.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene/others</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: All we know is the British have
discovered that it’s sometimes cheaper to buy supplies from friends of
Congress than to ship them here from England. As you can see, we are one
people, under God, united in greed.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The men rely on Congress for pay. But
Congress won’t pay the men with gold, because they would have to
authorize a general tax and they won’t because they refuse to trust the
notion of a centralized government.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: ‘Continentals’, Congress’ paper money.
It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have
made them even less than worthless. Can you tell which one is fake?</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: I… they look both the same.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The one with ‘Philadelphia’ spelled
correctly is the counterfeit.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: No, please; an advance on your
salary.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Mon General, I have come here to learn
and to give, not to take. I am serving without salary.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You must be very rich.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: I am. Then, I understand you too serve
without salary. You know, since your charming little victories at
Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening. I expect any time
now a ship load of supplies…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: ‘Charming little victories?’ Please
don’t expect much more of us, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: I only meant…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: These supplies…?</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: And how rusty are these muskets?</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Sir, these are our finest firearms from
the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of
France!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, we will accept these charming
little gifts. When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a
horse.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: I rode here, on my horse.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Chose another. Any general worth
anything should have a brace of horses.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Are you going to keep him, sir?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: We better, Congress invented him.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Maybe he can fight…</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: The men seem to like him. Maybe he
could shake off some of our gloom. And, he’s the only real evidence we
have that anyone else in the world cares about our revolution.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Nathanael’s right.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: If we can get coats and boots for these
men I don’t care if they’re made in France or hell.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Because, if the British got off their
asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed. And the revolution
would be finished. Tell King Louis, it’s that bad.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Yes, I will write him and tell his
ministers and the court.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: We need muskets, powder!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: And the men need to believe that someday
France will join us.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: It’s impossible to stop these men
deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: They go back home to keep their families
alive, stay into the spring to plant. Then, they start coming back to
us.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Like flowers after the snow melts.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis,
I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British
soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: My Lords and Ladies, tonight’s
entertainment will be the slaughter of the American Rebel Armies.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Seven thousand strong, our magnificent
army of the North, as we drink, is rolling down the Champlain Valley
like the mighty Juggernaut, crushing all resistance before it.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: To the south of New England, our
second, vast host of fifteen thousand, will thrust inland, smashing
Mister Washington’s army – perhaps taking the rebel capital – and swing
up to link with our northern force.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Congress wants to court martial me…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’m ashamed to say, I’m not surprised to
hear it.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Welcome, Benedict; splendid work.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I received the request for your court
martial three days ago. Amazing how rapidly Congress can act when
motivated.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’m accused of using some government wagons
to ship personal property.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Congress has been using our supply wagons
for years to ship their black market goods – probably their whores!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They’re after both of us, Benedict.
There is a plot in Congress to have me replaced, perhaps with General
Horatio Gates.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Have a look.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The British are going to evacuate
Philadelphia in the spring.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Our plan is to hit them as they
leave.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: While they’re strung out?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Exactly. We’d attack the baggage wagons
and the rear guard. It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the
center with our main force and cut them in half.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Lovely, but your men can’t get weak
knees.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They’re ready. Believe me, the ones that
stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything. Of course, we get
nothing from Congress. They need boots, coats… we desperately need
food.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Same old story.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Except I believe it’s pointed and
intentional now.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: There was this anonymous pamphlet
circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all
our hardships. And… that I have encouraged the people of America to make
me into a God! Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: That can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: There’s this whispering campaign against
me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Gates? He used my battle plan and I humbly
submit that without me he’d still be back at Saratoga waiting for the
British to attack. George, why haven’t you moved into the Potts’ house
back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than
your field tent. And… you could entertain. I think you need to entertain
more. Seriously! Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some
Congressmen… couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: As soon as the men have good shelters
I’ll move. Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: There, then, you can have sort of a normal
life.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Have you heard? The British are
negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: I’m sure his dogs will be overjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The point being: he’s also a candidate
for my job. If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in
me.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, Benedict, here’s to the two most
hated men, on both sides of this war.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: My people! My people! My people have
declared themselves for America! France will fight with us as comrades
against England!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What is it, Marquis?</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: My baby daughter has died… my baby… mon
petite Henriette…</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: From Congress…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Men, I just received an urgent
communication from Congress and they asked that I read it to you… please
stand at ease. “Today, King Louis of France has formally recognized the
sovereignty of the American Colonies.” This means we can finally expect
help from France!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: But there’s more: “This day, to
demonstrate heart-felt gratitude for the suffering of our forces for the
sake of liberty and freedom, it is decreed… it is decreed that all troop
observe a day of fasting.”</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Marquis, as of today, you will have
command of your own cavalry division.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Benedict, soon as the British vacate, I
want you to take a division and march to Philadelphia. Until you’re sure
order has been restored I’m declaring martial law. It’s bound to be a
quiet job and this is one time Congress will be happy to see you.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: The British are not very happy at giving
up Philadelphia. They take it out on the whole country.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: As soon as we contact their
rearguard, we fight. George will be up with the main force by noon.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: General Lee, welcome back. I’m happy
you’ve decided to join us.</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: More than that, sir… my orders from
Congress.</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: I am to take command of Major General
Lafayette’s division and lead the attack.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Lafayette will not be happy…</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: Congress made me second in command, you
have no right to deny me.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: General, I believe our men are going to
destroy Cornwallis’ army tomorrow. They’ve looked forward to that
pleasure for a long time, so I highly recommend you pay strict attention
to General Greene’s plan of battle.</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: If I’m going to catch up by tonight,
I’d best get going.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Get the body of our army up to Greene’s
vanguard as fast as we can. All the damned fool has to do is hit the
British rearguard and then hold for us.</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: What is your pleasures, General Greene
and Major General Lafayette?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: We would like to consult with you
on your plans, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: Quel sort de plan?</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Why, your battle plan, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: I do understand your language
Monsieur!</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Oui, General, certainement…</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: You’re nothing but children, and you
question me? Gentlemen, we hit the British rearguard at dawn; then my
plan will become clear to you as it unfolds. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: My God! Who ordered this retreat?!</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: General Lee, sir!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Get these men back in line!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: All right men! Stop and reform your
ranks! Officers! Bring your men around!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What the goddamned hell do you think you
are doing!?</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: The British! These men cannot stand
against them!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What do you know about these men!? They
can stand against anything! They’ve seen more war than most field
generals! They are not cowards, sir! They are not afraid!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: We will stand here! Stand and die on this
spot!</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: Oh? Fine, let’s get these men turned
and then I will be delighted to die, right here, on this spot.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Who is that!?</p>
<p><strong>general lee</strong>: That’s Greene. He’s supporting our
reconsolidation.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Marquis! Get these men reformed, send
Steuben and Wayne out on the left…</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: What the hell are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You’ve got to stop them here or our
whole line will cave-in! It’s all right boys, I’m here!</p>
<p><strong>black officer</strong>: General! Fresh enemy unit!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Boys! These men coming are the Royal
Fusiliers!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They’re Noblemen every damned one! From
the best families in England! Knights and barons! The cream of the
British army! And you know what they think of us! Come on, men! Show
them who we are!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Ready arms!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: FIRE!!!</p>
<p><strong>british commander</strong>: For shame, Royal Fusiliers! For
shame!</p>
<p><strong>british commander</strong>: Is the finest blood of England to
be spilled by an army of Niggers and Mongrels!? Never! On to the day,
boys! On to the day!</p>
<p><strong>british commander</strong>: Our England! Our King! On to the
day!!!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Wait boys! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: FIRE!!!</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Sharp-shooters! Kill that officer – that
man on the white horse! Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: General Washington?</p>
<p><strong>cornwallis</strong>: Shit! Shit!!!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You did good, boys! You beat them! Don’t
be broken hearted! Tomorrow! We’ll get the bastards before they get
away! Tomorrow! Tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: They’re gone. Pulled out in the
middle of the night. They got away from us.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Wil…</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Yes, general?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You’ve served me loyally, year after
year, without complaining. I’ve thought hard about you this past winter.
I want to free you, Wil. I want to give you your freedom, after this
battle is fought.</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Yes, general.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Wil, I’m giving you your freedom. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: No. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You’d have money every year, so you
wouldn’t have to work. You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you
want…</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Clear those men out, Arnold! We have
come to arrest a Tory and confiscate his estate! We are here to cleanse
this town of all Tories!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: As military commander of Philadelphia, it is
my duty to protect the lives and property of all civilians. Under whose
direction beside your own do you operate, mister Reed?</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: I take my orders from God!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, my orders come from a higher
authority: General Washington. Disperse or die!</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: That scum Joseph Reed… they’re calling him
the ‘King of Pennsylvania’. The man’s a budding Cromwell. He condemns
rich Tories to death and then ‘appropriates’ their property for himself.
Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I’ve saved.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Couldn’t you have appealed to
Congress?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: They love Reed and his inquisition! I think
they hope to share in his disgusting profits! It’s becoming the American
way!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You go too far, Benedict.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: These men were taken from their homes at
night, tried by Reed’s courts – which Congress recognizes – and, well,
you can see.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Cut those men down. Congress is pushing
ahead with your court-martial. Benedict, trust me to handle this.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I
can’t see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General
Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: The man is a traitor!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: How can you say that?</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Did you know he is engaged to Peggy
Shippen? She’s the daughter of a Tory, George.</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Arnold supports the British cause!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: If he supports the British why is it
that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them? Unlike
General Lee… who you and Congress backed for second in command and who
is a goddamned incompetent!</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Lafayette is a child!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Lafayette is my friend! He believes in
glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he’s a
child. But he would have died before he would have let me down.</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: Is that your test of patriotism, George;
if a man will die for you?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: God damn you, Sam Adams! You wanted a
revolutionary army and now that we’ve really got one it scares you more
than it does the British!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: You are a pagan criminal!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I swear to your God and my God, Reed, if
you sponsor any more terrorist acts in Philadelphia I will send in the
army!</p>
<p><strong>abigail adams</strong>: My dear, are you keeping General
Washington all night?</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Abigail… You know Abigail?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Mrs. Adams. I promise I’m nearly done
here.</p>
<p><strong>abigail adams</strong>: Well, no more secrets, all the ladies
want to know: who was that darling young woman you were dancing
with?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: She’s a mechanic’s daughter, Mrs. Adams,
as a matter of fact.</p>
<p><strong>abigail adams</strong>: Well, I suppose a working girl stays
pretty healthy; I can see why she can keep going all night. I mean…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Martha rarely dances, so she can hardly
deny me the pleasure of a good dance now and again.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: My dear, tell the ladies I’ll return the
general to them shortly. Please.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Arnold is indispensable, do you
understand? I need Arnold to help me win this war!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: Well, I shall deny him to you! He is
evil on earth!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Are you all going insane!? Benedict
Arnold! The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain! Who carried
the day at Saratoga! Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in
an expensive, Tory coach! You are all nothing but a pack of greedy
pigs!</p>
<p><strong>joseph reed</strong>: You will court-martial Arnold the
traitor! Or I will deny your army teamsters and wagons for your spring
offensive! Congress will back me, George.</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: George, I’m sorry. We all know the army
will acquit Arnold…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Of course the army will acquit him,
that’s not the point… Arnold is a man and will understand. What I need
to understand is, John, Sam… what is happening here? Who are those
people in there? The fat ones in silk?</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: They are… friends of Congress.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Is that where our meat and boots and
uniforms and muskets went?</p>
<p><strong>john adams</strong>: Partially…</p>
<p><strong>sam adams</strong>: It’s the political ‘cost of doing
business’, George.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Tell me, John, Sam: are all revolutions
doomed to be won by the young and then ruined by old fools? Or is it
just old fools using the young to get fat? I will notify General Arnold
of our decision. Good night…</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: General Washington has thrown me to the
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: General Washington?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Where is General Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You had better read these.</p>
<p><strong>peggy shippen</strong>: There’s the man who will kill my
baby! Murder my baby!</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: My god, what has happened?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: A British spy was caught with the plans
to West Point in his boot, written in General Arnold’s hand. Colonel
Hamilton, send the guard and see if they can catch up with Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: He included a copy of our agenda. So,
the British could ambush us. He set us up to be killed. You, me and
Alexander. Do you understand? We can expect a British attack at any
time.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: General Greene is here. There are two
other divisions here.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Colonel Hamilton. Anyone who served
under Arnold, I want them shipped north. I don’t want any troops here
who served under Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Did you know that Arnold left the entire
defenses of this fort in complete disrepair? Most of our cannons are so
neglected they may as well have been spiked!? You realize what would
happen if this fort fell? The whole Hudson would be open to them!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Colonel Hamilton, you think this is all
my fault, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Sir, I think no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Don’t lie to me, Hamilton! If I had not
court-martialed Arnold…</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Sir, Arnold is a traitor.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I must tell you sir you treat me with
disrespect!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: I am not conscious of it, sir! But since
you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Very well, sir; if it be your
choice!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Nathanael, I’m sending you to Virginia
to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis. Marquis, you must go
with him.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: I’m honored, but, reluctant to
leave you.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: I feel the same, sir.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I will continue with our French allies,
concentrating on New York.</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Sir, I have to act on instructions
from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: They’re for my bodyguard. I have an
absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated! It
will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: Yes sir, it’s a wise idea…</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: The sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Will you ever think of me again?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: My dear, I can never stop thinking about
you.</p>
<p><strong>lafayette</strong>: Ah, les bons vieux temps ou nous etions
si malheureux! Oh, the good old times when we were so unhappy!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Congress has informed the army that it is
bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: This is a declaration of insurrection!
Who wrote this!?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: No one knows…</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: After all these men have done! Many have
lost everything! Their loved ones, their property! That pension was the
single thing that kept them going!</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: George, remember that night when we were
drinking with Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: To hell with Arnold…</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: He warned you some day you might have to
act for the good of the people – even if it was against Congress.
George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.
Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a
throne! George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Is this a coup? Alexander, are you
trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don’t agree?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: What’s your advice, Alexander?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: March on Philadelphia! Get Joseph Reed,
and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who’ve grown fat off the war!
Get them all! Sweep them aside!</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I want to address the officers, all the
officers. Next Friday. Can we arrange it at the mess?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Yes, I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, if it’s my last order, then I
order them to be there! Tell them I will give them my decision then.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you remember, eight years ago, when you
stood at that window in Philadelphia, the night before your appointment,
and you told me what this was all about?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s just as you said, then: you ended up
with everything. What are you going to do with it? Eight years ago you
were sure you knew.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Share it with me, George. What is it that’s
out there now, eight years different? The men who were in power at the
beginning are still in power; the big landowners and slave holders
haven’t changed. What really has changed?</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Washington has got everything… and I
have lost it all: beautiful America. America the treasure we fought so
long and so hard to keep. We burned their towns; we captured their
cities; we blocked their ports; we beat them repeatedly in open combat.
How did it end like this after eight years?</p>
<p><strong>minister 1</strong>: My Lord, Parliament and the people
simply lost the will to fight.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: If you’re going to lie, then convince
me that I should not abdicate.</p>
<p><strong>both ministers</strong>: My Lord! My God, no!</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Good, good; that’s better. I am
beginning to see that it would be an error for me to abdicate. General
Arnold?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Your Majesty, it is not too late to defeat
the Americans; if you have seen my proposal…</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: Yes, General Arnold, I have seen it and
Cornwallis tells me it’s a brilliant campaign plan. But, it seems you
left the Americans too soon and came over to me too late. Because now,
the game is up.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: I wonder what ‘General’ Washington will
do. They say he plans to retire, just leave the stage. What do you
think, Benedict?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: After fighting eight years? I know
Washington, I know his soul, I know his mind: he’s an aristocrat.</p>
<p><strong>king george</strong>: You think he’ll seize power?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Well, if he doesn’t he’ll be better than us.
In fact he’ll be the greatest man in the world…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I have noticed by my calendar that today
is the Ides of March. I believe that when we all leave here, the world
will look differently upon that date. “A scrap of paper has circulated
recently though our ranks. This dreadful alternative of either deserting
our country or turning our arms against it has something so shocking in
it that humanity revolts at the words. Are we here today going to cast a
shade over that glory which we have so justly acquired and tarnish the
reputation of an army which is celebrated through all Europe for its
patriotism? I say we must not. I have been asked to consider becoming
dictator or king of America. I say we cannot allow this to happen here!
For if we do, we again set in motion the endless wheel of revolution,
betrayal and despotism. As you value your own sacred honor; as you
respect the rights of humanity, you must give eternity at least one
distinguished proof of unexampled patriotism and virtue! And if you will
– by the dignity of such conduct – you will afford occasion for
posterity to say: had this day been wanting, the World had never seen
the last stage of perfection to which human nature is capable of
attaining.”</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I have here a letter from the
Congressional Delegation of Virginia. They asked I read this… “With
heavy heart and good conscience we implore you to trust in our
sincerity…”</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You have seen me grow grey in your
service. Now you see me growing blind.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: The officers have voted unanimously to
support you sir… and Congress. I support you too, George.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Wil, I want to remind you of a
conversation we started just before Monmouth…</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: I ain’t forgot about the freedom.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, what have you thought?</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Well, general, I think I ain’t got no
school learning, I ain’t got no trade… and I’m a drunk. So, I think
there ain’t much left to be set free.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, this must be about something!</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: It is; we need you George.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Have you decided if you are going to join
the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: George, you’re the only man the people
trust… trust with power. They know you won’t betray them.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: But it’s more than just that, am I
right?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: If the constitution is ratified…
we’ll have a country. They’ll want to elect you president of the
convention, which means president of the country.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to
retire. I don’t need to be in government.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: That’s why the people trust you George.
Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him,
everything will fail. Will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: You’re asking me to be president of a
republic, not king? Not a dictator over subjects?</p>
<p><strong>nathanael greene</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>billy lee</strong>: Lots of people out there, general.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: There should be, General Washington’s guest
list, contrary to Mister Hamilton’s suggestion, isn’t very
particular.</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: Well, this party is open to everyone,
isn’t it? Isn’t it just open to America?</p>
<p><strong>militia man</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen. May I present…
the President of the United States of America…</p>
<p><strong>washington</strong>: “My dear Sally, years have passed since
we were last together. They’ve been times of astonishing change,
sometimes tragic and sometimes truly wonderful. But I wanted you to
know, that nothing will ever destroy my memory of those happy days – the
happiest in my life – when we lived together in our youth. I have
wondered often that you should not prefer spending the Evening of your
life among us, your dear friends, in the country you so dearly loved,
rather than close the final scene in a foreign place. A Century hence if
this Country keeps united, it bids fair to be one of the greatest and
happiest nations in the world.”</p>
