<p><strong>mother</strong>: Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks up the
free cheese, ’kay?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: This’ll keep the sun out of your eyes. You
be good now.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t fucking move, you little shit-
machine. Mommy’s gonna try to score.</p>
<p><strong>passerby</strong>: Excuse me–who’s watching these babies?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: The fat one’s watching the little one.</p>
<p><strong>passerby</strong>: Oh, nice parenting. Leave’em out here like
that and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>passerby</strong>: Ah, keep on truckin’.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: D’jou hear the crazy fuck tellin’ me how to
fuckin’ raise you? Motherfucker, man! Who’s he fucking think he is?
What’s the worse fuckin’ thing could happen to you sitting outside the
fuckin’ stores? Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: Fuck, fuck, fuck…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: –fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother fuck,
mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother- fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck,
noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed, smoking weed, doing coke, drinking
beers! Drinking beers, beers, beers, rolling fatties, smoking blunts!
Who smokes the blunts? We smoke the blunts!</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: Lemme get a nickel bag.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fifteen bucks, little man. Put the money in my
hand. If the money does not show, then you owe-me-owe-me- owe. My Jungle
Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh! I think I want to know ya’, know ya’–</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: What the hell are you singing?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You don’t know “Jungle Love”? That shit is the
mad notes. Written by God Herself and handed down to the world’s
greatest band–the motherfucking Time.</p>
<p><strong>teen 2</strong>: The guys in that Prince movie?</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: Purple Rain.</p>
<p><strong>teen 2</strong>: Man, that shit was so gay–fucking eighties
style.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Bitch, don’t you NEVER say an unkind word about
The Time! Me and Silent Bob modeled our whole fucking lives after Morris
Day and Jerome! I’m a smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and Tubby here’s
my black manservant!</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: What’d I tell you two about dealing in front
of the store? Drop the kid and peddle your wares someplace else,
burn-boy. And for the record, The Time sucked ass.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo-youse guys wanna hear something fucked up
about him and the Quick Stop guy?</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: Hey, can’t we do something about those two
stoners hanging around outside all the time?</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: Why? What’d they do now?</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: I’m trying to watch Clash of the Titans, and
all I can hear is the two them screaming about Morris Day at the top of
their lungs.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: I thought the fat one didn’t really talk
much.</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: What, am I producing an A&amp;E Biography
about ’em? I’m just saying they shouldn’t be loitering around the stores
like they do.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: Neither should you, but we let you stay.</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: See, man–if you were funnier than that, ABC
never would’ve canceled us.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: Two packs of Wraps. Yo–how was the
service?</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: What service?</p>
<p><strong>teen 2</strong>: The one at the Unitarian church where you
two got married to each other last week.</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: Jay said you had a Star-Wars–themed wedding
and you guys tied the knot dressed like storm troopers.</p>
<p><strong>teen 2</strong>: Yeah. And he said you’re the bitch and
you’re the butch. Oh, sorry–the Leia and the Luke.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: I’m the bitch?!</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: Well if we were gay, that’s how I’d see
it.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: Would you shut up?!</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: Holy shit, dude. The honeymoon’s over.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: We’re not married to each other.</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: Well, sure. Not in the eyes of the state or
any real church, Skywalker.</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: That does it. I’m gonna do something about
those two. I shoulda done a long time ago</p>
<p><strong>teen 2</strong>: In a galaxy far, far away!</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: May the Foreskin be with you. Hand Jabba the
Hutt.</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: Yeah, I want to report a couple of drug
dealers out in front of the Quick Stop.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the Fuck, Serpico? What’d we do?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: We got a report that two guys were hanging
around outside the stores, selling pot?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We don’t smoke pot, yo.</p>
<p><strong>teen 1</strong>: Here’re the rolling papers you wanted for
your pot. And your change. Thanks. And The Time sucks ass!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: No pot, hunh? What do you need this for?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What? I got a wiping problem. I stick these
little pieces of paper over my brown-eye, and bam–no shit stains in my
undies. You don’t believe me? Lemme show you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Just spread my cheeks a little and you can see
the fucking stink nuggets–</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Pull up your pants up sir, Now!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Let’s take a ride down to the station.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What? It’s suddenly a crime to fart,
motherfucker?!</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: No fucking way!</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Dante and Randal slapped you with a
restraining order?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Judge said if we go within a hundred feet of
the stores, we get thrown into County.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: So you gonna abide by the court’s ruling or
you gonna go Bandit– Reynolds style?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck yeah! You know what they make you do in
county? Toss the fucking salad! I don’t like this fuck’s asshole; I’m
gonna do it for some stranger?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: I guess if you really wanted to hang out in
from of a convenience store, you could just buy your own now– what with
all that money you guys made.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hell yeah, bitch. Wait a second–what money?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: The money from the movie, dumb-ass.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck are you babbling about?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: boarded issue down</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?! Since when?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Goddamit, man– Here’s the pulse, alright.
And here’s your finger– –far from the pulse, jammed straight up your
ass. Say–would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: You see, kids, if you read Wizard, you’d
know it’s the top story this month. Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: When the fuck did this happen?!</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Well, after X-Men hit at the box office, all
the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their
hands on. Miramax optioned Bluntman and Chronic.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Miramax? I thought they only made classy flicks
like The Piano and The Crying Game?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Yeah, well once they made She’s All That,
everything went to hell. So you’re saying you haven’t gotten a cut of
the movie? Didn’t Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards used to pay you
likeness rights for the comic book?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We haven’t seen a fucking dime for no
movie!</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Well boys, I’m no lawyer, but I think Holden
and Banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash. I mean they’re
making a movie based on characters that are based on you and Quiet
Robert.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It ain’t me and Quiet Robert. It’s a pair of
stupid-ass superheroes that run around saying “Snitchy-Nitchies” or
something.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: I believe it “Snootchie Boochies.”
Regardless–you’re getting screwed. If I was you guys, I’d confront
Holden McNeil and ask him for my movie check.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: And on that note, we cue the music.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Well! I have been waiting years to do this.
Look at these morose motherfuckers right here. Smells like someone shit
in their cereal. Bunngg!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck took you so long answering your
damn door? You trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of
that gay-ass three-way action with your buddy?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: No, I was just showering your mother’s stink
off me after I gave her a quick jump and sent her home. But now that you
mention it– Thanks, you know. You could’ve made the moral of that story
you told me a bit more clear.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: So what brings you two dirt merchants to my
neck of the woods?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh, I’ll tell you what our necks are doing in
your woods–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Where’s our motherfucking movie check?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You heard about that too, Hunh? Well, I’ve
got nothing to do with it. That’s Banky’s deal. He owns the property
now. I signed my half of the Bluntman and Chronic right over to him
years ago.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Why the fuck would you do a thing like
that?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Because I’m almost thirty, for God’s
sake–why on earth would I want to keep writing about characters whose
central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes? You gotta grow,
man. Don’t you ever want more for yourself? I know this poor, hapless
sonovabitch does. I look in his doe eyes and I see a man crying out,
“When, Lord? When the fuck can your servant ditch this foul-mouthed
little chucklehead to whom I am a constant victim of his folly, and who
bombards me and those around us with grade-A foolishness that prevents
me from even getting to kiss a girl? Fuck! When?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m the chucklehead? Fuck you–you’re the
dumb-ass who gave away his comic, and now you ain’t got no fat movie
check neither.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: When you’re right, you’re right. I wish I’d
broken off a little piece for myself. Because if the buzz is any
indication, the movie’s gonna make some huge bank.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What buzz?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: The Internet buzz.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck is the Internet?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: The Internet is a communication device that
allows people the world over to bitch about movies and share pornography
with one another. Here’s what we’re looking for: “Movie
PoopShoot.com”</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: “PoopChute.” Yeaaahhh.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: This is a site full of militant movie buffs:
sad bastards who live in their parents’ basements, downloading scripts
and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors
they despise yet can’t stop discussing. This is where you go if you
wanna hear frustrated would-be filmmakers mouth off with their two- bit,
arm-chair-director’s opinions on how they all could’ve made a better
Episode One.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Here. This is about the Bluntman movie.
“Inside sources tell me Miramax is starting production this Friday on
their adaptation of underground comic fave Bluntman and Chronic.”</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Friday?! Shit. Does it say who’s playing us in
the movie?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: No, but if it’s Miramax, I’m sure it’ll be
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. They put’em in a bunch of movies.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: You know–the guys from Good Will
Hunting.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You mean the fucking movie with Mork from Ork
in it?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Yeah, I’m not too big a fan either. Though
Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Word, bitch. Phantoms like a motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Now down here is where you can gauge the
buzz. This is the Shoot Back area. It’s where people who read the news
get to chime in with their two cents. Here’s what a guy who goes by the
chick-magnet Net handle of “Wampa- One” thinks about Bluntman and
Chronic. “Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid alter egos Jay and
Silent Bob only work in small doses, if at all. They don’t deserve their
own movie.” He’s got a point.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck him. What’s the next one say?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: “Bluntman and Chronic is the worst comic I
ever read. Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters. A couple of stoners
who spout dumb-ass catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong or
Bill and Ted. Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid
asses.”</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Who the fuck said that shit?!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: A guy who calls himself “Magnolia- Fan.”
Check out what the guy after him said: “Jay and Silent Bob are terrible,
one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at. They’re fucking clown shoes.
If they were real, I’d beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. I
can’t believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit. I, for
one, will be boycotting this movie. Who’s with me?” And then there are
about fifty more posts from people who agree to join Spartacus-here’s
boycott of the flick.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m gonna kill all these fucks–</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Ah, let it go. Number one, they’re a bunch
of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the Net to insult
people who’re doing what they wish they were doing, and number two,
they’re not really talking about you guys–they talking about Bluntman
and Chronic.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: But they said Jay and Silent Bob! They used our
real names. It doesn’t matter that there’s a comic book version of us
and a real version, ’cause nobody knows we’re real in real life.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah! And all these people who read that shit
think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots ’cause of that
all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob! And
maybe one night, me and Lunchbox’ll be macking some bitch, and she’ll be
like “Oooo! I want to suck youse guys dicks off. What’s your names?” And
I’ll be like, “Jay and Silent Bob.” And she’ll be like, “Oh–I read on
the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs.” And then she
goes and sucks two other guys’s dicks off instead! Well fuck that! We
gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our
good names!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: First off, I don’t know how good your names
really are. Secondly, there’s not much you can do about stopping this
bile. The Internet’s given everyone in America a voice, and everyone in
American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. As long as
there’s a Bluntman and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are gonna have
something negative to say about it. Jay steams, thinking. Then, a light
dawns on him.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: But wait a second–if there wasn’t a Bluntman
and Chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent
Bob, right?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: They’re not saying anything about you
now–they’re talking about fictional characters!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So all we gotta do is stop ’em from making the
movie!</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands
of dollars in royalties you’re due in the process. Are you fucking
retarded? Look, I’m probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is
the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. I mean, a Jay and Silent Bob
movie? Who would pay to see that?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: But since it is happening, you might as well
just ignore the idiots on the Internet, go find Banky, and get your
“motherfucking movie check.” As you so succinctly put it. That’s what’s
important here.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No, Holden McNeil–what’s important here is that
there’s a bunch of motherfuckers we don’t even know calling us assholes
on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can’t even get
laid. Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever
do. When did it say they’re making that movie?</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: They start this Friday.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So if today’s Tuesday, that gives us– Eight
days.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: It’s more like three days.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Right. Three days to stop that stupid fucking
movie from getting made! C’mon, Silent Bob–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We’re going to Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Now that’s what I call the Blunt leading the
Blunt.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Tickets? Since when did they start charging for
the bus?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Didn’t we used to ride that shit to school
every day for free?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We in Hollywood yet?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: It’s a three–day ride to Los Angeles, sir.
We left twenty minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I didn’t ask you about Los Angeles. I asked you
about Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hollywood’s in Los Angeles, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Don’t change the subject! Are we in Hollywood
yet or not?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Please sit down, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Why don’t you take your seat Ralph Kramden–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m fucking bored, man. There ain’t shit to so
on this bus.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I already did that. Twice.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo, Gretzky–lemme get a turn.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Leave me alone, little kid.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That fuck called me a little kid and gave me
the finger! Go kick his ass!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re my muscle, ain’tcha?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So go open a can of whup-ass on that little
fuck, and get me his game!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re one tough motherfucker, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: They been in there going on half an hour
now! Two of them! Doing God knows what!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This bus isn’t moving another inch unless
you clear out of there right now!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Um–I think something’s burning back here.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: The whole fucking world’s against us, dude. I
swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This sucks balls, man. How come we ain’t
getting no rides?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ’Cause you’re doing it all wrong.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You gotta induce the drivers a little.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Like how?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, but what happens when you get in the car,
and you don’t make with the head? Don’t they kick your ass to the
curb?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Sure–if you don’t make with the head.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Eww! You eat the cock?!?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Yeah. If it’ll get me a few hundred miles
across country. I’ll take a shot in the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, but we ain’t gay.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Well, neither am I. But have you seen the price
of bus tickets lately? Shit–I don’t wanna cough up two hundred bucks
just to get to Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, I don’t wanna cough up some dude’s
sperm!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Don’t be so suburban–this is the new
millennium. Gay, straight–it’s all the same now. There’re no more
lines.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: There’s one. On this side of it, we ain’t
gay.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: All hitchers do this. Why do you think people
pick us up? If you get a ride, it’s expected–I don’t care who the driver
is. It’s the first rule in the Book.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What book?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: The unwritten Book of the Road.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Follow the rules of the Book, and you’ll get
where you’re going in no time. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: You two boys need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: You both don’t have to sit back there. One of
you can sit up here with me.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: So where are you boys from?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: What brings you to Indiana?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We’re going to Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Hollywood, hunh? That’s a long ways away.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah–we’re lucky you picked us up.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Well, do unto others. That’s what the Book
says.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait a minute–you follow the Book, too?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I live my life by it.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Really? You?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Of course. You know how lonely it gets on the
road? Thanks to the Book, I’m never alone–if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I guess. This guy back there explained it to
us. But I didn’t think you’d be into that.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Are you kidding? I’ve dedicated my life to it.
Every hour of every day.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Shit–you nuns are alright.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: You live by the Book, too?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You picked us up, didn’t you? I gotta.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: That’s good to hear. But it takes deed, not
words. It’s a lot easier to say you live by the Book than to actually do
it. Can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You want me to do it right now?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: No time like the present, right?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright. You hear that? She’s not a Catholic.
She’s a Presbyterian.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Dude–she had seventies bush.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I can’t believe this shit. Five hours and not a
single ride. Every day, millions of people hitch to Hollywood and stop
studios from making movies about ’em. But when you and me try it, it’s
like we’re trapped in a fucking cartoon!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Zoinks, yo</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: And now we can finally solve the mystery of the
Hitchhiking Ghouls! Pull off their masks and let’s see who they really
are!</p>
<p><strong>bookish</strong>: I don’t think they are masks.</p>
<p><strong>beauty</strong>: I don’t think they’re Hitchhiking Girls
either.</p>
<p><strong>bookish</strong>: Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.
Though I wish they were hitchhiking girls. Sexy, skimpily clad
hitchhiking girls–</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Let’s kick them out. We’ve got a mystery to
solve.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: The only mystery here is why we take our cues
from a dick in a neckerchief!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Keep it up, Beatnik! I’ll feed you to the
fucking dog!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Youse guys need to turn those frowns upside
down! And we got just the thing for that. We call them Doobie Snax.</p>
<p><strong>great dane</strong>: Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look at his fuckin’ lipstick!!! He’s got a
stoner-boner!!!</p>
<p><strong>beauty</strong>: I think they passed out.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Great. What do we do with them now?</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Let’s cut out their kidneys to sell on the
black market and leave them in a seedy motel bathtub full of ice.</p>
<p><strong>bookish</strong>: Oh God, not again?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Holy shit, I had a horrible dream. Yo, I’m
hungry. Where can we get some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo–check that shit out: the Internet. Let’s see
if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: “Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob is gonna
lick balls, because they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely each
other’s.”</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Eww. “Yes–they are real people. Real stupid
people. Signed, Darth Randal.” Motherfucker! It’s time we wrote
something back! Type this shit down.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are
the ones who are the ball- lickers. We’re gonna fuck your mothers whole
you watch and cry like little bitches. Once we get to Hollywood and find
those Miramax fucks who are making the movie, we’re gonna make ’em eat
our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our
shit that we made ’em eat. Then all you motherfuckers are next. Love,
Jay and Silent Bob.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’ll fucking show ’em. Now we eat our
Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get back on the road, get to Hollywood, and
stop that fucking movie from getting made. No more hairy-bush nuns, no
more dogs. We keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing– and I mean
NOTHING–distract me.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh my God. Do you get free refills with
that?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh, what–this? I just wear this for protection.
You know–so no guys try to grab my shit.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi. I’m Justice.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And I am so fucking yours–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I mean hi. I’m Jay. And this is my hereto
life-mate, Silent Bob.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: It’s nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Justice, hunh? That’s a nice name.
Jay’n’Justice, sitting in a tree. F-</p>
<p><strong>u-c-k-i-n-g–</strong>: So you come here often?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Oh, I’m not from around here. My friends
and I are taking a road trip, and we just stopped to grab something to
eat.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Your friends, hunh? Where they at?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Out there. By that van.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Dude–I think I just filled the cup.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent Bob are
in the Hizz-ouse!!!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Who the fuck are these guys?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: This is Jay and Silent Bob. Guys, this is
Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Where the fuck did they come from?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: I met ’em inside. They’re gonna hitch a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I don’t know if that’s such a great idea.
Jussy.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Sure it is, Juggs.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: Oh my god–he just called Sissy “Juggs”!</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Chrissy, no!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: We’re in the middle of suburbia, Chrissy.
Let’s try to act like it.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: And what-stupid ass little foul- mouthed
bitch-boys don’t get their balls cut off in suburbia?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s with the knife? We having cake or
something?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Holy shit–he’s retarded, to boot.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo–she called you retarded.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: What’s wrong with you, Justice? You do
remember where we’re going, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: That we do have a job to do?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: They’re just gonna tag along for a few
miles. They won’t get in the way, I promise. Please?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Fine–they can ride with us. But they’re so
out of here before we get to Boulder.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Honest Injun.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: “Honest Injun”? I can’t believe what a
pushover you are.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And I can’t believe fine-ass bitches like
yourselves eat that shit. Don’t you know fast food makes girls fart?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Say–what’s all this talk about farting?</p>
<p><strong>sissy/chrissy/missy</strong>: Hi Brent!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: This is Brent. He’s with us, too.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Brent, tell these sillies that girls don’t
fart.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Of course they don’t! Only skeevy stoners
fart.</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What up, homies? Wow, Three guys, four girls–
What’s the count boys?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Hey there mister science-guy. Don’t spray
that aerosol in my eye. For I don’t really want to die. I’m a noble
rabbit!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’re you guys, like a cover band or
something?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: We’re the Kansas State chapter of
S.A.A.C.–Students Against Animal Cruelty.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: And we’re on our way to Colorado to give
Provasik a piece of our minds!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck are you bitches babbling
about?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Hey! Watch the language little boy. There are
females present.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical lab
where they perform gross experiments on animals.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So, what kind of animals are we talking about
here–like bears and rhinos?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: No–more like rabbits, dogs, cats… heck, even
monkeys, If we don’t speak for them, who will? Right, Jussy?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey, uh–Brent? Can I talk to you over here for
a second?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Be honest, yo–you’re down with this for the
fine-ass pussy, right?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I’m down with this because I love animals,
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Even sheep?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Of course. Sheep are beautiful creatures.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: They are beautiful, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: Oh God, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So then you’d fuck a sheep?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: What is your damage little boy? You’ve got a
sick and twisted world perspective.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No, you misunderstand me, Prince Valiant. I
mean if you were another sheep. Would you fuck a sheep if you were
another sheep?</p>
<p><strong>brent</strong>: I–suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: What the fuck are we gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Shut up, I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Is Hollywood near where we’re going?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Is that where you guys are from?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Ch’yeah, right. Jersey represent!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you all the
way out here?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, we couldn’t hang in front of the Quick
Stop no more, ’cause of the strainen-en order, which sucks ass ’cause
it’s been like our home since we were kids. Silent Bob even busted his
cherry there.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You did? I’ll bet she was a lucky girl.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look, fuck that fat fuck–I’m trying to tell a
story here.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Anyway, we were talking to Brodie and he said
there’s gonna be a Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we went to see Holden
McNeil, and he showed us the Internet, and that’s where we found all
these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us. So we decided
to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from getting made. And now we’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Wow. I have no idea what you just said.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like animals,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s cool. Even snakes?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You can’t exclude an animal just because
it’s not cuddly. Of course I like snakes.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: How about trouser snakes?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: What’s a trouser snake?</p>
<p><strong>jay devil</strong>: What the fuck are you waiting for? She
went for the setup! Reach in your fucking pants, and pull yer cock out,
bitch! That’s the kinda shit girls like!</p>
<p><strong>jay devil 2</strong>: Right about here’s where the angel’s
supposed to show up and tell you not to pull your dick out. But we
bitch- slapped that little fuck and sent him packing, so it’s smooth
sailing. Let ’er rip, boy!</p>
<p><strong>jay angel</strong>: Sorry I’m late. So what’s the deal here?
Oh, shit–you’re not thinking of whipping your dick out at this fine
piece of woman, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jay angel</strong>: Tell you what: look at Silent Bob. See if
he thinks it’s a good idea to whip your dick out.</p>
<p><strong>jay angel</strong>: That’s it, boy–put the dick down. You
gotta go from the heart, yo. No little perv bullshit will do for this
one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the shit
out of two suckerpunching little bitches. Remember–don’t pull your dick
out until she asks you to. Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg! The Jay
Angel blinks away. Justice looks at Jay, a bit confused.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Don’t ask. So, uh–what can a pimp-daddy like me
do to help the animals?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You really don’t want to help us–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about? Sure I do.
I’d do anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I mean, youse guys! I’d do anything for youse
guys. For the lift and shit.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Sure, I’m sure. I said it, didn’t I. Fuck</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Well–okay. Let me talk it over with the
other girls and get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’ll be right here.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck you. Fatty.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You guys want anything from inside?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No, we’re cool, thanks hon.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It just ain’t the same, is it? This place licks
balls compared to Quick Stop.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And speaking of licking balls–how ’bout that
Justice chick? She is too fine. And she smells so fucking pretty. She’s
got a nice voice, too. And that body? Smoking. You know, she never once
said “fuck off,” when I was talking to her, or pulled out the pepper
spray, or nothing. I tell ya, Lunchbox–she could be the one.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: Smooth move, Justice.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Nice going, Four Eyes!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Why the fuck did you let that little stoner
throw Brent our of the van?!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Oh please–if I had to listen to one more of
those stupid songs, I was going to throw him out myself.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: We needed Brent, Justice! He was our
patsy!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: We’ll find someone else. Besides, I didn’t
see you trying to stop Jay from throwing him out.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Because I didn’t want to blow our cover!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Cover, shmover–you all hated his songs,
too.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Not as much as I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Fuck, if I don’t get to kill someone soon,
I’m gonna–fucking kill someone!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Don’t mind Chrissy. She’s just a little too
wound for sound.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Then how about you help me take the edge
off?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: They’re really good friends.</p>
<p>****: Would you two knock it off? We’re in the fucking heartland
here! Try to blend!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: They already do–she’s the milkmaid, and
she’s the cow.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Oh, I’m a cow, am I? I’m a mad cow, bitch.
And now I’m gonna rip your head off and fuck your spine stump.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Enough! We have a very simple gang here,
Justice. I’m the brains, Chrissy’s the brawn, and Missy’s the tech-girl.
But lately, I’m having a hard time figuring out what you’re doing
here.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: That makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Shit–your name doesn’t even fit the rhyme
scheme.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: That’s because very few names rhyme with
“douchebag.”</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: You’re dancing on my last nerve, Strawberry
Shortcake. You deal with the weak link. I’m gonna take Missy into the
dirty convenience store bathroom and hate- fuck the shit out of her.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: And you said letting them read all that
Anais Nin wouldn’t amount to anything.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Don’t change the subject. You know what you
have to do now, right? Since you let our patsy slip away, you’ve gotta
convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place. They’ve
gotta break into Provasik now.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Uh-uh!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Uh-huh. You’ll do it; or you’re out of this
gang. Just use the little one’s crush to convince him, since he’s so
fucking in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Jay? No he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: What–am I blind? He wasn’t kissing your hand
back in the van like he was fucking Lord Byron?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Well, maybe he was just raised with
manners.</p>
<p><strong>licked by a fat man in an overcoat?!</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You’re the one that brought the kid in,
Jussy. So you’ve gotta make amends.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Jay is not taking Brent’s place as the
patsy.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: That kid and his quite friend are our only
options at this point. Now we got about two hours before we get to
Boulder. That gives you plenty of of time to work on him.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: I’m not gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Why the fuck not?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Because he’s just to so innocent!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Look at him–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m gonna finger-fuck her tight little asshole!
Finger-bang and tea-bang my balls–in her mouth! Where? Where? In her
mouth–balls-a-plenty in her mouth! Balls, balls, sweaty balls–</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Who’s it going to be, Jussy–him or us?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Steal a monkey? Shit–no problem.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: It’s not really stealing–it’s liberating
it, and– Wait a second–did you say, “No problem”?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, Fuck–we steal monkeys all the time.
Right, Lunchbox?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: It’s not like it’s a bad thing. It’s for a
good cause.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri– The cause
of love. Snoogans–</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: What the heck is that?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s what?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: “Snoogans,” I believe it was.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck do you think it means? It means
“I’m kidding.”</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Ohhh. Well, that’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I can’t believe I’m gonna get some pussy for
stealing a monkey! If I’d known it was that easy, I’d’ve been stealing
monkeys since I was like seven and shit.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Don’t, motherfucker. Don’t you ruin this for
me. Me and Justice are gonna get married one day, so don’t be giving me
that “we-ain’t-stealing-no- monkey” look. I’m Morris Day; you’re Jerome,
bitch. Don’t forget that. That girl? That girl’s in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: They’re gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Good. They do their part– And we’ll do
ours.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Remember–we meet back here when you’re
done. You sure you’re okay with this?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: As sure as I am that you’re the hottest bitch I
ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s twisting that bitch’s tits?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Maybe it’s because women don’t like to be
called “bitches,” Jay.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: They don’t? Well how ’bout “piece of ass”?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: How about not.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, what the fuck am I supposed to call you,
then?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Something sweet, you big goof. Something
nice.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Boo-boo kitty fuck.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Okay. That’s a start.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Jay, before you go, could you say something
into the camera about the clitoris.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Man you are such a bitch–</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: She’s just a little embarrassed. See, Jussy
and I are putting together this documentary for our Human Sexuality
class, and we need a male perspective on the clitoris.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: The female clitoris?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Uh–yeah.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Jay, you don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Nah, it’s cool, hon. There’s a few things I can
say about the clit that I’s like you to hear. I am the master of the
clit! I make that shit work! It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!
No one rules the clit like me! Not this little fuck! None of you little
fucks out there! I am the clit commander!!! Remember that– commander of
all clits!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Awesome. Knock ’em dead, Tiger.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So–can I get a little kiss for good luck?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So–can I get a little blow job for good
luck?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Jussy. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my authority
again, you lose your fucking fronts, you got that?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Phase One, down. While we’re executing Phase
Two, you edit that tape and grab a new car.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: No sweat.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Let’s suit up.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You fat fuck–</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: They in?</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: You can say that.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Time to shine. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You are so gay.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Once we’re inside, I want complete silence.
Missy whipped this up. It counts our decibel level. If it goes into the
red–alarm, we’re dead. So not even the slightest noise, got it?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Justice! Move your ass!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Stay frosty, you big fucking softie. We’ve got
a job to do.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal tranquilizer.
This shit fucks you up like Percocets!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hold this. Later, me and Justice can shoot each
other with it and fuck like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: “Suzanne.” Boo-yah.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Holy fuck–the little stoner was right–</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Boom Box!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I can’t believe it. Months of planning and
it’s all blown by a fucking fart.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: We can’t just leave them like this! That
alarm’s gonna bring the cops here any minute!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: That was always the plan, Justice! They take
the heat off of is long enough until we can get out of town!</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: It’s set. Let’s roll.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck are you looking at? There ain’t
no snacks here, man! Now we got what we came for, so let’s get the fuck
out!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, it’s sad! But what the fuck are we
supposed to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh shit–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Justice–</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Oh, fudge… Marshal Willenholly!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby– It
takes two hands to hold doesn’t it–? Uhhh–</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Sir, we got a report of a break-in at
Provasik Pharmaceuticals’ testing lab.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Have you read this article on the
mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I wish that was in our jurisdiction–
I’d shut down every last one of those ass-cock chuggers, personally.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: What? “Ass” means “donkey.”</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the
jet.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: We don’t have a jet, sir. And Boulder’s only
ten minutes away.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Then gas up the next best thing.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats out?
Wait–is that right?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Excuse me–who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Federal Wildlife Marshal. This
investigation is now under my jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Oh really? And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Because someone let a whole mess of
animals out of their cages, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Well, we believe that was just a diversionary
tactic used to call attention away from the real heist over here at the
Diamond Exchange.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Yeah, right. That’s a believable
scenario. It sounds more like something out of a bad movie.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Sir, the Provasik people say they’ve rounded
all their animals up, except for one: an orangutan.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our
fugitive has been on the run for 6 hours! Average simian foot speed over
uneven ground–barring injuries or preoccupation with tire tubes, mites
or bananas–is four miles an hour. That gives us a radius of twenty
miles.</p>
<p><strong>cop 3</strong>: Twenty-four, sir!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cop 3</strong>: Six hours times four miles an hour is
twenty-four.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Yes. Yes, you’re right. My bad. Twenty-
four miles. Now what I want out of all of you is a hard target
search.</p>
<p><strong>cop 4</strong>: Excuse me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cop 4</strong>: What does that mean, exactly–a “hard target
search”? What’s a “hard target”?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Well. It’s–a target–that’s–hard.
Anyway–</p>
<p><strong>cop 4</strong>: So are you referring to the search’s level of
difficulty? Or is the hard target the monkey?</p>
<p><strong>cop 3</strong>: Or the people who stole the monkey?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Okay, how about this? What I want out
of all of you is a thorough search of every gas station, residence,
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in that area!
Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Wouldn’t it make sense to put them up at
every twenty-four miles–seeing as that’s how far they’d have gotten in
the last six hours?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: This is so frustrating. It’s just so
hard sometimes–</p>
<p><strong>cop 5</strong>: Sir, this was just delivered to the
station.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>cop 5</strong>: It’s a tape from the terrorists who’re
claiming credit for the break-in.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Is it VHS or Beta? You know what– never
mind. Do you have a VCR?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Oh my God– Have the jet gassed up and
ready to go at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Sir, we don’t have a jet; just a
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Doesn’t anybody have a jet anymore?
Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta get me on the national news,
pronto. Why?! Because we may very well be dealing with the two most
dangerous men on the planet!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This is Jussy’s monkey</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Do something. Tons of Fun!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Is that fucking thing waving at us?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Holy shit? That monkey understood us! Maybe
it’s some sort of super- monkey!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck was that for? It’s not a stupid
idea! I seen it in Congo?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re my bitch. You get my back. Don’t go
joining this chimp’s side.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo–what if there’s more super monkeys up in the
lab? Maybe they’re making an army of ’em up there! Holy shit! Maybe it’s
a conspiracy–like on the X-Files Roswell–style!</p>
<p><strong>jay’s delusion</strong>: We enter into JAY’S HEAD and
see–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Working in secret with a crew of
double-dealing, nicotine-fiending fucks that’re selling out the human
race, these supermonkeys will use simian science and their genius IQ’s
to make man and monkey alike believe that they’re the superior
species!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Then all it’ll take is one little monkey in a
spiffy suit to whip the dumber chimps into a frenzy, until they go all
ape-shit and start demanding more bananas, better pay, and human
flesh!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’ll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan’s
Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit,
and the occasional inter- species blow-job. And if you don’t wind up
with a monkey hog in your mouth, you’ll be captured, killed or
worse…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Eaten alive!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Then these monkey fucks’ll start wearing our
clothes and rebuilding the world in their image.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And only those who outwit those damn dirty
apes’ll ever remember that it was MAN who once ruled the earth!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Not on my watch, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright–you can live. For now.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You see that? Bitches love me. Besides–we’re in
the fucking clear, yo. It’s not like anyone knows we stole the
monkey.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: I’m Reg Hartner and this is a News Now
bulletin. A Provasik animal testing facility in boulder was the focus of
an attack by a terroristic primate rescue syndicate calling themselves
the Coalition for Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers. Or simply,
C.L.I.T.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: In a videotape sent to authorities this
morning, credit for the liberation of an orangutan from the lab last
night is taken by these men–</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: –identified in literature that
accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent Bob. In this chilling clip, they
make it very clear that they are in control of the C.L.I.T.</p>
<p><strong>digitized voice</strong>: We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are
safe. Now tremble before the might of our merciless leader.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Terrifying. Here to help us understand
this footage is Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Marshal, what can you tell us about the
C.L.I.T.?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: From the intelligence we’ve been able
to gather, we’ve discovered that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot of the
L.A.B.I.A.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: The Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning Apes
movement.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Exactly. The men you saw in the video
are believed to be the masterminds responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T.
activity last night. They go by the obvious code names “Jay” and “Silent
Bob.” If you should come across them or any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please–
exercise extreme caution.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Marshal, how do you respond to
allegations that Federal Wildlife Marshal’s Office allowed the C.L.I.T.
to slip through their fingers?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Nonsense. We’re all over the C.L.I.T.,
Reg.</p>
<p><strong>holden</strong>: Nights like this, I miss dating a
lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Is there also speculation that Jay and
Silent bob may be responsible for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist that
occurred in the same vicinity of downtown Boulder last night?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: There’s nothing to suggest that, no.
But these men are still to be considered very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: I told you that restraining order was a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: Is that your cell phone?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Yes, Excuse me. Federal Wildlife
Marshal. I’m on my way! We got ’em. They’re in Utah. Citizens of
Utah–steer clear of the C.L.I.T. Stimulation of the C.L.I.T. is not
recommended.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Your tape worked. The news is all about Jay
and Silent Bob’s Provasik break-in, with almost no mention of the
Diamond heist.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I told you those two were the perfect
patsies. Now we lay low for awhile– just in case–and start planning the
next job.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Don’t you feel any regret? Jay and Bob
don’t deserve this. They were really sweet.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: The only thing I regret is not gutting that
little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his
vitals.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: You are so nasty.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: I’ll show you nasty, you little slut.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Would you two get a room?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Fine–we’ll take yours. I am gonna stain
your sheets, bi- otch.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: They’re your gang.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Oh and not yours? You know, I don’t get you,
Justice. You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning,
blowing shit up. Now you’re like this little priss with a conscience.
It’s really a fucking drag.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: We all gotta grow up some time.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: If moping around over some little boy you’re
crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman
underoos.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Don’t you feel the least bit of guilt for
what we did to those guys?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about
setting up her boyfriend? Then how about taking a shower?</p>
<p><strong>pizza delivery guy</strong>: You the gals that ordered the
pizzas?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: This dopey bitch ordered the large plain, but
I could go for some hot, thick, Sicilian.</p>
<p><strong>pizza delivery guy</strong>: No charge, lady. He rushes into
the motel, Justice sighs, looking up at the stars.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: I’m sorry, Jay.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You know, Justice died trying to save this
monkey, so maybe we should keep her around. That way, we can honor her
memory.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look at you Tubby Bitches. I’m waxing all
sentimental, and you’re all about a fucking meal and shit. Now ain’t you
glad we stopped to eat? And you were all piss-scared the cops’d bust us
or something. You know what I say?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You think they’re talking to us?</p>
<p><strong>you have sixty seconds to comply.</strong>: Fuck it, Let’s
give ’em thirty.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: The ape.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: An orangutan’s a member of the great ape
family. It’s not a monkey.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Look, who’s the Federal Wildlife
Marshal here?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck are you waiting for? Go out there
and give ’em the monkey.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh, what, man? I said that shit before I knew
they were gonna shoot us! Yes–Jussy was a hottie, but I ain’t takin’ no
bullet for no monkey!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh, brother–this is like something out of
fucking Benji! Look man, maybe it’s not that bad back at the lab! Maybe
they experiment on ’em by, like making ’em fuck a bunch of different,
good-looking monkeys. We don’t know! Maybe they got it real sweet!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You stay out of this, you weepy little chimp!
Fuck man, I ain’t no strategist! You’re the guy that makes the
blueprints! I don’t even have the fucking smarts of a little–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: –kid</p>
<p><strong>open fire!</strong>: Everyone has bullets in their guns,
right?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Don’t shoot! We’re just trying to take our son
out of this hostile environment!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Their “son”?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Maybe they’re one of those gay
couples?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah! We’re gay! And this is our adopted love
child! We’re not from around here! Don’t make us go back to our liberal
city home with a tales of prejudice and bigotry in the heart of Utah!
You see the shit I gotta put up with for you! Now I got this guy
thinking I’m gay!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Oh God, this is the last thing I need–a
bunch of uppity homosexuals shooting their mouth off in the liberal
press that the Federal Wildlife Marshal’s Office persecutes gays.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: You see this badge? I think I’d
recognize an ape if I saw one. And the only thing I do recognize here is
a political fiasco I’m, going to avoid by letting this butt-fucking
Brady Bunch go!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And I’ll tell you another thing: what if that
guy shows up around the stores one day and starts telling everybody you
and me are poo-gilists? How are we gonna get any pussy then, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So we can just go?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Yes, sir–or ma’am. Please accept my
apologies for detaining you and your unorthodox-but-constitutionally-
protected-family unit.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Un-fucking believable.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’d like to offer a big gay thank- you, sir.
We’ll tell all our gay friends that Utah is Gay friendly country for
gays who are gay.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: I’m sure Utah appreciates that. You
might also want to make it clear that the Federal Wildlife Marshal’s
Office is also pro-’mo as well. And might I add, that’s one fine-
looking boy you’re raising.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, that’s ’cuz he’s from my sperm. See, I
knocked up a hot woman friend of ours who I also fuck on the side. So as
not to be all-the-way-gay. But my tubby husband here is one hundred
percent queer. He loves the cock.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: He certainly looks insatiable.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: ’Bye</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: ’Bye</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Well, it’s not my way–but damned if
there doesn’t go one happy family. Now, we just shoot some tear gas into
that diner, and when the two guys run out with the monkey, we’ll–</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: That was the them, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I said you “love the cock”! I gotta be the
craftiest motherfucker alive!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty
ape!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You fat fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You just–had to–order pancakes– didn’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Fire a warning shot into that bulbous
ass!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: One rectal breach, coming up!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Open up and say “ahhhhh,” you stoner
sumbitch–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Just like Winnie-the-Pooh.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Wow! That was an incredibly daring
escape! You must see that a lot, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Sire, you’re very taciturn.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: You and your men stay up here. When I
corner them, I’ll call you for back-up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What’re you doing? They’re trapped. The
only way they can get out of there is right here.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn’t wait
for his prey to come to him. He comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it “comes
to it” or “goes to it”? I’m going in there. I’m counting on you
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: You’ve taught me so much.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Fuck this asshole. Let’s go back to the
station and get some donuts.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This reminds me of the night I fucked your mom,
yo. One big-wet, smelly, gaping hole, and me wishing I had a board tied
to my ass–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: –to keep from falling in.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: See, man?! He’s lining us up like fucking
circus seals! Well, I’m going first–I don’t want no mouthful of
monkey-spit when I gotta blow this fucking G-Man.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Oh, no–think you can pull a Peter Pan
on me?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You see that shit? Damn–remind me not to get on
the monkey’s bad side. Yo–boost her up. So we can talk, so we can get
the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Man! Who the fuck just steals a monkey?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh yeah. Well this fucking blows! We got one
more day to stop those fucks from making that movie, and someone goes
and takes the only thing I had left from the one woman I ever loved
enough NOT to try to stick my hand down her pants!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Go after the monkey? How the fuck are we
supposed to know where that thing’s going?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What? What is that supposed to mean?! Don’t
just fucking point like– You ain’t the broad in the Children of a Lesser
God. Use you fucking mouth for more than eating, ya tubby bitch!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You gotta take a shit? No–you gotta take a
salad? Take a salad? What the fuck are you trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Say it, don’t spray it, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: “And might I add, that’s one fine- looking
boy you’re raising.”</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well, if it isn’t the wildlife experts. Did
you come to it or go to it?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Do you have a microwave here,
Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: We have a toaster oven. Why?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Because I need to dry my gun out so I
can SHOOT YOU WITH IT ! TWICE!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: This might cheer you up. Your office just
faxed this over. Guy there say it’s a post from an Internet chat board,
signed by a “Jay and Silent Bob.” Your man thinks it’s a lead as to
where those fellas are taking the ape.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: “All you motherfuckers are gonna pay.
You are the ones who are ball- lickers. We’re gonna fuck your mothers
while you watch and cry like little bitches. Once we get to Hollywood–”
They’re going to Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What? It’s not like it’s cheating. Justice blew
up.</p>
<p><strong>hooker 1</strong>: Hey, little man. You want some of
this?</p>
<p><strong>hooker 2</strong>: How about you, Big Boy?</p>
<p><strong>hooker 1</strong>: If you’ve got fifty bucks we can get
nasty.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh yeah? How nasty?</p>
<p><strong>hooker 2</strong>: As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright–first, I’ll want to tongue your bung
while you juggle my balls in one hand and play with my asshole with the
other. But don’t stick you finger in. Then. I’ll wanna pinky you and put
it in your friend’s brown, while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie cup.
After that, I’ll wanna smell your titties, for a while, and you can pull
my nutsack up over my dick, so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I want you
to flick at my nuts while your friend spanks me into the same Dixie cup
Silent Bob jizzed in. Then we throw the Dixie cup out.</p>
<p><strong>hooker 1</strong>: Oh, that’s it honey. I quit. This job just
passed the point of no return.</p>
<p><strong>hooker 2</strong>: You one fucked up puppy, poppie.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?! You said ‘nasty’? Man, chicks in
Hollywood are so stuck up.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright, here’s the plan: first, we find out
where they’re shooting that movie at. After we shut that shit down, we
can start looking for the monkey. But before we do any of that shit, we
gotta find a motherfucker in the know. Someone who’s like, the mayor of
Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Crack? You want some crack? Sweet- ass rock.
Get you high.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No man, but you want some weed?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: You on the job?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: I’m Los Angeles Local 305!</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: You guys got medical in Jersey yet?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Shit, no, we might have to strike in
September.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Norma Rae like a motherfucker. You gots to
get your benefits, you know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I hear that. Yo–maybe you can help us out. You
know where they’re shooting a movie around here.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: You in this town and you gonna ask that
question? Be a little more specific.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It’s a Miramax flick. We gotta bust it up so
people stop calling us names on the Internet, even though they’re not
really talking about us but these characters based on us, and at the
same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who- got-killed-in-a-car-explosion’s
monkey.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: I don’t know that the fuck you just said,
little kid. But you touched a brother’s heart, so I’m gonna help you out
with some directions to the studio.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You know where Miramax is at?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for
seventy-eight percent of my business.</p>
<p><strong>steve kmetko</strong>: Is Hollywood ready for Jay and Silent
Bob? A source at the Federal Wildlife Marshal’s Office tells us a
posting was pulled off an Internet movie chat board that was allegedly
written by the two domestic terrorists themselves. It’s sending a
shockwave through Hollywood. Jules Asner’s on the scene at Miramax
Studios, Jules?</p>
<p><strong>jules asner</strong>: Steve, the tenor of Tinseltown is one
of terror today, after the Federal Wildlife Marshal’s Office learned
that hot, new terrorists Jay and Silent Bob are targeting Miramax
Studios for their next campaign of blood, violence and monkey-theft. In
the posting, pulled off Movie Poop Shoot.com, the gruesome twosome
threatened, quote– “Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax
Expletive-Deleted who are making the Bluntman and Chronic movie, we’re
gonna make ’em eat our Expletive-Deleted, then Expletive- Deleted, which
is made up of our Expletive-Deleted, then eat their Expletive-Deleted,
which is made up of our Expletive-Deleted that we made ’em eat. Unquote.
So far, we haven’t been able to get a statement from anyone here are the
studio.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jules, word has it that Ben Affleck and Matt
Damon are on the lot, shooting a super-secret project. Have you seen
then roaming around?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: No, Steve. But I did see Casey Affleck buying
a soda at a concession stand earlier.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: None whatsoever. However, to be fair, all the
feds have to work with is murky videotape, so no one’s even a hundred
percent sure what Jay and Silent Bob look like, exactly. For all we
know, they could already be on the lot.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Oh my God! Jay! No!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: That bitch! That fucking, fucking bitch!!!
Get dressed. We’re going after her.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Fuck that, I didn’t get to cum yet.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Which is more important to you: a fortune in
diamonds or busting a nut?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Chrissy! Now!</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Fuck–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We gotta play this right.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I hate how fake Hollywood is.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: This is L.A., sir. We don’t rape our
suspects in custody. We just beat them. Echo Base, I’ve got a
ten-o-seven here: two unauthorizeds on the lot. Request back-up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I thought that was a ten-eighty-two.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: No, sir–a ten-eight-two is the code
for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben Affleck’s trailer.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey! I make you a deal: this guy’ll suck your
dick off if you let us go!</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Contrary to what you believe, not
everyone in the movie business is gay.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, how about this deal: he sucks my dick
while you watch and jerk off.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Alright. But make is fast. And
sexy.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Dude, it’s either this or jail. And you know
what they make you do in jail.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well what are you waiting for, bitch? Start
sucking. Bunnggg! Alright–where they shooting this movie at?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Worth a shot. Like a shot in the mouth, you gay
bitch. Eww, dude–you were really gonna suck my dick.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Alright–bar extras. Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Yes, this is Federal Wildlife Marshal
Willenholly. Can I speak with Agent Sid Enmarty, please?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: One moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>speaker voice</strong>: Agent Enmarty? A Marshal Willenholly
calling.</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: Holy shit! Yeah, put him through.</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: Willenholly?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Sid? Hey, buddy. I’m calling because I
could really use your help on this killer case I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: I’ll bet, Will. What’s it this time…
Beaver trouble? Some kind of unauthorized marsupial trafficking?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: No, no–nothing like that. Say–there
aren’t other people listening in, are there?</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: No way, man. It’s just me and you talking
here.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Good. I’m tracking a monkey down that’s
on it’s way to Los Angeles, and I could use some bureau backup.</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should stake
out Clint Eastwood’s place. Didn’t he used to drive around with a monkey
that’d punch people and drink beer?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Am, uh–Am I on speaker phone?</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: No way–Dunston!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Alright, now that’s not fair. I know I
didn’t make it as high up as you guys, but my job’s just as
important.</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: Calm down, Will. Don’t go all… bananas on
us!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: I come to you as a friend–as a fellow
professional–and this is the shit I get?!</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: You’re right, Will. Tell you what– we’ll
get our best man on your case right away. You might’ve heard of him.
He’s a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Oh, a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>agent sid</strong>: His name’s Doctor Zaius!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where are we taking it from, Gus?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re a true artist, Gus</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Just take it from “It’s a good course.”</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, now you’re the director.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let’s remember who
talked who into doing this shit in the first place. Talking me into
Dogma was one thing, but this–</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry this is taking you away from
whatever-gay-killers-on-horses- who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-
flick you’re supposed to be doing this week.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh–I’m touchy-feely? I take it you never saw
Forces of Nature?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re like a child. What’ve I been telling
you? Sometimes you’ve gotta do the safe picture. Sometimes, you do it
for art. Sometimes, it’s the payback picture your friend says you owe
him–</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And sometimes, you go back to the well.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now that’s just mean.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, ’cause
that’s those two fucks from that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do is
figure out a way to get close to them–</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Just stand there and react. Don’t say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s pretty funny.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Alright, people. Lock it up. Let’s go for
picture.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: On the count of three, we rush those fucks and
beat the shit out of ’em. ’Cause if they’re all fucked up, they can’t
make the move, right? Alright, then. One–two–</p>
<p><strong>clapper/loader</strong>: Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting
Season.</p>
<p><strong>clapper/loader</strong>: Scene sixteen, take five.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Action, Gus?</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Jesus, Ben–I said I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>ben/chuckie</strong>: You should check it out, it’s a good
course. But, you know, frankly, I found the class rather elementary.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You know, I don’t doubt that it was. I
remember that class. It was just between recess and lunch.</p>
<p><strong>ben/chuckie</strong>: Are we gonna have a problem, again?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: There’s no problem. I was still just hoping
you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy
in the Southern Colonies. See, Wood says–</p>
<p><strong>matt/will</strong>: What’d I say? Didn’t I say you’d be back
here regurgitating Gordon Wood. But you forgot about Vickers–</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No, I just read Vickers, so I’m up on
inherited wealth, Hunting. But you’re not the angry, brilliant young
mind you once were, just itching to vent your frustrations.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Once Sean told you it wasn’t your fault, you
lost the edge, William. You stopped hitting the books with a vengeance,
and now I’ve read shit you haven’t even heard about yet. Face facts, my
friend–love made you a soft little pussy boy, unable to stand up to an
academic showdown, like you used to. You’re just no longer that
good–Will Hunting. Now how do you like them apples?</p>
<p><strong>ben/chuckie</strong>: I don’t like the sound of them apples.
Will, what’re we gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>matt/will</strong>: Chuckie– It’s Hunting season.</p>
<p><strong>ben/chuckie</strong>: Apple sauce, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a
ten-oh-seven on our hands.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a second! I wasn’t with any hookers
today!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Affleck, you’re the bomb in Phantoms, yo.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: If anyone’s looking for me, I’ll be in my
trailer trying to figure out how I got here from an Academy Award.</p>
<p><strong>clapper/loader</strong>: Scream four, scene thirty-seven,
take one.</p>
<p><strong>wes craven</strong>: Action!</p>
<p><strong>shannen doherty</strong>: Alright, you bastard! Let’s see who
you really are!</p>
<p><strong>shannen doherty</strong>: Fucking Miramax–</p>
<p><strong>wes craven</strong>: Shannen, usually I say “cut.”</p>
<p><strong>shannen doherty</strong>: A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren’t
even trying anymore, are you?</p>
<p><strong>wes craven</strong>: The market research suggest that people
love monkeys.</p>
<p><strong>wes craven</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Holy shit–that looked like it hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Are you guys alright? Hey! They’ve got a
monkey!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo, I think that shit just kicked in.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Let’s get you guys on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: See man? Its never, “Hey–you were in Loser,
or,”Dude–you rocked in Boys and Girls.” It always comes back to that
fucking pie! I’m haunted by it.!</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Well, you put your dick in a pie, dude–</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Enough! Jason Biggs.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo-you really get to third base with the
Russsian chick like you did in the movies?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: She’s fucking hot, man. If I was you, I’d been
like–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What, man? You never did one of these?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Holy shit? You’re the Dawson!</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It’s James, actually. James Van Der Beek.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo, what’s up with Pacey stealing Joey away
from you? If I was you, I would’ve drowned his ass in your Creek and
shit!</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I know, Because what–is Josh better looking
than me? Fuck, no. I mean, who on earth is better looking that me? I ask
you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Joey, man! She’s too fine! Yo–did you ever get
to third base with her?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Well, there was this one time– Wait a
second–who are you guys?!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: They’re our stunt doubles, dumbass.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Stunt doubles for what?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: The movie we start shooting in a few
minutes–Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You’re doubling me. I’m playing Bluntman, AKA
Silent Bill.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Bob</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Right. And he’s playing Chronic. AKA Ray.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Jay! Shit, did you even read the script?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There’s a script?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: These are the guys who are playing us, yo. We
take them out, and bickety- bam! No movie.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What’s with the weird, gay huddle going on
over there?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What’s gay about it? It’s two guys talking in
a corner. Man–why are you such a homophobe.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m not a homophobe.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You are. You’re always calling things gay.
“Ooo–look at the gay huddle, dude!”</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey–look at the monkey.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Next you’re going to tell me the monkey’s
gay.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: He’s so cute– C’mere. Monkey. C’mere–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Alright, here’s what we do: start swinging, and
don’t stop until those young Hollywood fucks are out of commission.
Ready? Break!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s one funky monkey.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mister Biggs? Mister Van… Der– Beek? This is
Security. We’ve got a pair of intruders at large, and they crashed
through a window we thought might be yours.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Uh–yeah. They’re in here.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Do they have you hostage? Should we
call your publicists?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: NO! I mean, we kicked those guys’ asses bad.
They’re–knocked out.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Great work, sirs! If you let us in,
we’ll take over–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in here!
Together!</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Uh–okay. We’ll just be–outside the
door, sirs.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the fuck are we gonna do?! How are we
gonna get out of here without them seeing us?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: He’ll be the pie–in prison.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In these
outfits we’re totally incognito.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek?
Great–you’ve changed costumes already. Let’s get you to set. The
director doesn’t like to be kept waiting.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Look at all these crackers, Seventy
million dollars and I can’t even get a black grip?</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: Here’s your coffee, sir.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: You spit in this? Because I know all you
white folks are pissed off that the studio’d entrust a multi- million
dollar to a brother.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: I didn’t spit in it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Then taste it! Go on!</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: It’s all good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: No it ain’t all good. Oh, you think I want
it now, after your lips touched the cup? Get the fuck off my set!</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: You the man, sir.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: No you the Man! And that’s the
problem!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi–I’m Banky Edwards, the
creator of Bluntman and Chronic. We met a few weeks back. I’m the
executive producer.</p>
<p><strong>director/chaka</strong>: Oh–you’re the executive producer,
hunh? Well go “produce” me a latte no white folks spit in–okay
Fucky?</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Banky. I just wanted you to know that I
respect your work as an artist. I’m something of an artist myself. I was
the inker on the comic book.</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: An inker? What, like you trace?</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the set,
Chaka.</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: I don’t see ’em. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This must’ve set ’em back a couple hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: Look at this shit. A gay hood ornament, and
the color Purple.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: Who the fuck am I? I’m the fucking director,
is who I am. Chaka Luther King. The creator of all of this.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait a sec–I thought Holden and Banky created
this shit.</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: And I’m stealing it. I’m taking it back for
all the shit you people have stolen from us! Did you know, I came up
with the idea for Sesame Street before PBS? I was going to call it
N.W.P.–Niggaz with Puppets. Alright–enough small talk. Let’s shoot
it.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait, wait, wait!! Aren’t you gonna direct
us?</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: I’ll be directing you to the food stamps line
after I fire your ass, if you talk back like that to me again!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: But we don’t know what we’re supposed to do
here. We didn’t even read the script.</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did the
studio. Look man, it’s not hard. In this scene, the bad guy breaks into
the Bluntcave. You make up some shit, fight him for a while, I film it,
I yell “cut,” and then head back to my trailer, where I got more white
women waiting for me there than the first lifeboat off the Titanic! They
all want a part of the movie, and I got just the part for ’em.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: I got you another cup of coffee, sir. Spit
free.</p>
<p><strong>clapper/loader</strong>: I just wanna say that I loved when
you fucked that pie.</p>
<p><strong>jay/chronic</strong>: Uh–Snootchie Bootchies.</p>
<p><strong>jay/chronic</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>cock-knocker</strong>: You thought I’d never find your
precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp Knight? But now you and your sidekick
are finally in the grasp of Cock- Knocker!</p>
<p><strong>jay/chronic</strong>: Why do they call you
“Cock-Knocker”?</p>
<p><strong>cock-knocker</strong>: Any last words before I bust your
balls, Bluntman?</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: Damn! Now that was one special effect! This
picture’s gonna make House Party look like House Party Two!</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Or House Party Three?</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: I think George Lucas is going to sue
somebody–</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: So, this is Hollywood? Lights, camera,
action, Jay and Silent Bob.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Oh my God– Um–sorry. That was supposed
to be a warning shot. Uh–it looks like I’m on the wrong, uh–wrong
set.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You killed Mooby–</p>
<p><strong>cock-knocker</strong>: You are not upstaging me, Van Der
Beek!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now whose balls have been busted, bitch?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and Silent
Bob! Everyone stay calm. I’m a Federal Wildlife Marshal. These men are
the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a
monkey.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They didn’t really steal that monkey.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: It was just a diversion so we could steal
these.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: And they’re not the leaders of C.L.I.T. The
C.L.I.T. is not real.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: No–the clit’s real. The female orgasm
is a myth.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Are you guys alright?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You remembered. It was a frame-up, Jay.
Sissy. Missy, Chrissy, and I are international jewel thieves. We were
setting you up as a patsy, but I couldn’t go through with it, because I…
because I love you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah? So that means you’ll fuck me, right?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If she does, it’ll be considered
necrophilia.</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Because she’s gonna be one dead bitch. Hi,
Jussy. We catch you at a bad time?</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: You should’ve just let these guys go down,
Jussy.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was waiting
until I got to know her a little better. See, there was this little
angel on my shoulder, and he said–</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Shut the fuck up before I shoot you where
you stand in your pansy red booties.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red booties!
Man–why the fuck didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Let’s have those diamonds, Jussy.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: I can’t do that, Sissy</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Then lover–boy gets one in the brain.</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: Would any of you lovely ladies like a private
audition to be in my movie?</p>
<p><strong>chaka</strong>: A shitload of white people with guns? Time to
get my black ass out of here!</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: You really let me down, Justice. Throwing it
all away for a little stoner with bad pronunciation.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: What’s it gonna be, Sissy? Which fighting
style do you want me to kick your ass in?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Are you kidding me? I taught you all all your
moves myself. There’s not a style you can bust that I can’t defend
against.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You’re no match for my “Shaolin Monk.”</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Yeah, but I can bury you with my “Crouching
Tiger.”</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: A little “Venus’s–flytrap”?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: I’ll counter with “Dragon Crane.”</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: How about a little “Bitch, My Man Ain’t Yo
Baby’s Daddy”?</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Bring it on.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo–I hope one of ’em rips the other one’s shirt
off and we see some tit.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I just
wanted to say hi. I’m–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Banky fucking Edwards! Just the motherfucker we
came to see!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Holy shit! What the fuck are you guys doing
here?!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: All these assholes are calling us names on the
Internet, ’cause of this stupid movie!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: I feel for you boys–I really do. Those Net
snipers can be really cruel. But Miramax paid me a shitload of money for
Bluntman and Chronic, so it occurs to me that people bad- mouthing you
on some web-site is none of my FUCKING CONCERN!</p>
<p><strong>silent bob</strong>: Oh–but I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Here we go again–</p>
<p><strong>silent bob</strong>: Shut the fuck up. We had a deal with you
on the comics for likeness rights. And as we’re not only the artistic
basis but also the character basis for your intellectual property,
Bluntman and Chronic, when we said property was optioned by Miramax
Films you were legally obliged to secure our permission to transfer the
concept to another medium. As you failed to do that, you’re in breach of
the original contract–ergo, you find yourself in a very actionable
position.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: So, what do you guys want, to go away and
take your lady friends with you?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Shitcan this movie so we don’t get called names
on the Internet anymore.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Even if there’s no movie, people are still
free to talk shit about you on the Internet. That’s what the Internet’s
for: slandering others anonymously. Stopping the flick isn’t going to
stop that!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well this isn’t fair! We went to Hollywood, I
fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the
motherfucking nuts! We ain’t leaving empty-handed!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s up baby? You look good!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Isn’t that your girlfriend’s enemy?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh yeah. Get the fuck offa me, pig!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: You guys are gonna ruin my movie career.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, we want something for our mental
anguish.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Tell you what: we’ll settle this monetarily.
I’ll give you half of what I made.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Half?!?</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Half’s not good enough? Fine–I’ll give you
two-thirds of what I made!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck-you–you already said half? You can’t take
it back!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Done</p>
<p><strong>sissy</strong>: Your shit is so tired, Justice!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck–BITCH!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Hello? Truce? I think I killed both of
them.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: C’mon guys. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo, I was just about to jump in there and get
your back.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: No. I’m tired of running.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You awake, Marshal? Marshal?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Oh my God, I’m paralyzed. The monkey
shot me in the ass and paralyzed me! Oh the irony!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You’re not paralyzed. It was just a
tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey! My
friends in the Bureau are never gonna let me live this down!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You have friends in the F.B.I.?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: They all made it in, but I failed the
exam. Why the hell else do you think I became a Federal Wildlife
Marshal? ’Cause I’m a joke!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Maybe not. I can make you a deal that’ll
get you into the F.B.I., regardless of test scores.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: What kind of deal?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: You drop the charges against Jay and Silent
Bob and say you never found the ape. Make sure the world knows they’re
not in control of any C.L.I.T.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now wait a second–</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: I’ll explain later, Jay In exchange, I’ll
give you the diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy, Missy, Chrissy, and
myself. But I want a reduced sentence.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: You’d be willing to do that?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: For him? I’d be willing to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: I’m an international jewel thief who’s
facing a jail sentence.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s alright. I’m a junkie with a monkey.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: If I go to prison, will you wait for
me?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I don’t know. Will we fuck when you get
out?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Don’t change the subject. Will we fuck when you
get out?</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Snoogans.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Wow. There’s a lot of love in the
room.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Regardless of what you may have heard. I do
not kiss guys.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Sorry, Justice. We’ve gotta go.
Hey–stop stealing monkeys.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What–here?</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Well, boys–you’re rich in love– Well, you’re
in love. And to top that off, you’ve got your own monkey. What more
could two guys from Jersey possibly want?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: All those fucks to stop talking shit about us
on the Internet, for starters.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: What do I keep telling you? There’s not much
you can do to stop that. Well, short of showing up at all their houses
and beating the shit out of them, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You know–with all that money we’re gonna make
we can buy a lotta plane tickets.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yes. Ma’am, Does– William Dusky live here?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes. He’s my son.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: May we talk to him, please.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: One moment.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo–do you post as– Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop
Shoot.com?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And did you write “Fuck Jay and Silent Bob.
Fuck them up their stupid asses?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah, a while ago. So?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say Jay and
Silent Bob– “–are fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I’d beat the
shit out of them for being so stupid.”</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Really–</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: Now that was worse then Clash of the
Titans.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: I still can’t believe Judy Dench played
me.</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: Hey–remind me to renew that restraining
order.</p>
<p><strong>dante</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>randal</strong>: Because I’m gonna blast the flick on the
Internet tonight.</p>
<p><strong>steve-dave</strong>: Why can’t Hollywood ever make a decent
comic book movie?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Tell’em Steve-Dave!</p>
<p><strong>steve-dave</strong>: Would you stop saying that?</p>
<p><strong>trish</strong>: Well, that was just another paean to male
adolescence and its refusal to grow up.</p>
<p><strong>alyssa</strong>: Yeah, sis–but it was better than Mallrats.
At least Holden had the good sense to keep his name off of it.</p>
<p><strong>trish</strong>: Why wouldn’t Miramax option his other comic
instead? You know–the one he drew about you and him and your
relationship?</p>
<p><strong>alyssa</strong>: You mean Chasing Amy? That would never work
as a movie.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: I’m so fucking embarrassed–</p>
<p><strong>hooper</strong>: Honey, you should be. They took your
characters and reduced them to one ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was
like watching Batman and Robin again.</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Thanks. That means a lot coming from the guy
who pretends to be Shaft as opposed to the guy who takes shaft.</p>
<p><strong>hooper</strong>: I don’t hear you complaining nightly. In
fact, the only thing I do hear you say is “Yes, Hooper! Cradle the balls
and work the shaft!”</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: Hey! Hey! What’d we say? Not in public!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!</p>
<p><strong>banky</strong>: You–!</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s right, you sonovabitch! I’m back for
round two!</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: You know, I don’t get out to the movies
much. But I’d have to say Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!</p>
<p><strong>justice</strong>: Are these leg cuffs really necessary?</p>
<p><strong>willenholly</strong>: Don’t make me shoot you, Justice.</p>
