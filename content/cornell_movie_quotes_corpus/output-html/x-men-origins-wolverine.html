<p><strong>gilman</strong>: Kid didn’t even move. You see that? Where’s
your survival instincts, boy? The boy says nothing. He readjusts his
bookbag and resumes his long walk northward. GILMAN Hey! Gilman grabs
the boy’s shoulder and spins him around- GILMAN The hell you going? You
hear me talking to you? One of the other football players, MASON, walks
over and inspects the boy’s face.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: This is the kid whose old man robbed the
truck stop last year. Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the
boy’s neck and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him. The four lettermen
tower over the small boy. I C_ONTTNTT f 1</p>
<p><strong>gilman</strong>: You the one with the convict daddy? The boy
stares back at Gilman, unblinking.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>gilman</strong>: What’s the matter, you about to piss your
pants? Answer me. The boy says nothing, never looking away from the
bully. Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring, against
the.boy’s cheek. GILMAN You a tough guy like your daddy? Gilman shoves
the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The boy regains his balance,
never taking his eyes off Gilman. GILMAN You want to play tough guy with
me? Huh? Provoked by the boy’s lack of fear, by the insolence of his
stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face. The boy falls to
the ground. Blood spills from a gash in his cheek where the class ring
cut him.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Right cross to the face… and he’s down! The
football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy. The boy stands.
There is still no sign of emotion on his face. No fear, no anger, no
evident pain.</p>
<p><strong>gilman</strong>: What’s the matter? You want some more? The
boy doesn’t look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy in the side of
the head, knocking him down again. GILMAN Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Walking back to the car, Mason slaps
Gilman on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You gave that little pissant something to
think about. Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be
sprawled and crying on the ground. Instead the boy stands again, brushes
the dirt off his shirt, and walks toward Gilman.</p>
<p><strong>gilman</strong>: You got to be kidding me. I’m gonna knock
the– But Gilman’s words die in his throat as he sees something
impossible happening. The gash on the boy’s cheek knits itself shut,
leaving no sign of injury. Gilman is so shocked he doesn’t see the boy’s
fist whizzing toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another
punch. And then another. The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman,
but he fights with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking
and headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy. Gilman,
stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down, trying to protect
his face from the blur of blows. Mason tries to pull the boy off his
friend and suffers a bite to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off.
The other two football players, amazed to see their leader getting
pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe. The boy growls as he
batters the bully. He grabs Gilman’s collar and lifts the football
player’s head off the ground, prepared to deliver the coup de grace with
his right fist. Three bone claws spring from the boy’s hand, serrated
and razor sharp. Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand,
quits hollering and stares. The other two football players blink and
slowly back away. Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries
to crawl backwards, away from this beast on top of him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: But the boy is more shocked than-any of
them. He stares with horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew
existed. He stands and stumbles away from Gilman. Mason runs over, lifts
his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him toward the
Oldsmobile. The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and
speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road. The boy stares
at his claws and for the first time we see fear in his eyes. He screams,
a scream that echoes over the black spruce, into the darkening northern
sky.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: It’s okay… shh… it’s okay. Logan pants, chest
heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered sheets in his fists. Kayla
holds him tight until his bone claws retract. KAYLA I’m right here with
you. Okay? I’m right here with you. Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears
her long black hair pulled back in a ponytail. She’s been sleeping in
one of Logan’s flannel shirts. KAYLA The war dreams or the one where
you’re a kid? Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down. He
relaxes into Kayla’s arms.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The one where I’m a kid. Kayla runs her
fingers through his thick hair, kissing his forehead. He sees that she
has a small cut on her forearm. He takes her arm and looks at the
wound.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LOGAN I cut you.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: It’s nothing. Just a scratch. She kisses him.
KAYLA We need new sheets again, baby.</p>
<p><strong>carny barker</strong>: Come see the notorious Bird Man!
Half-man, half-eagle, is he an angel from Heaven or a spawn of Satan?
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is your last chance to see the creature
you’ve all been hearing about: We follow two BOYS who hand the barker
their tickets, pull aside the curtain and step into the sideshow…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Finally BEAK throws off his robe and
raises his wings to the crowd. As advertised, he looks like an amalgam
of man and bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings.
His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated by a long
sharp beak. He stares back at the gaping crowd. Beak looks more pathetic
than monstrous. His skinny limbs don’t seem very strong and he projects
an air of weary resignation, not menace. But when he flaps his gray
wings and caws at the onlookers, the children shriek in terror and bury
their faces in their father’s legs.</p>
<p><strong>sherrlene</strong>: I’m gonna knock with three.</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: Are you kidding me? He throws down his hand in
disgust.</p>
<p><strong>sherrlene</strong>: You always hold out for gin. You could
have knocked a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m an eternal. optimist.
Sherrlene tallies the points.</p>
<p><strong>sherrlene</strong>: All right, I’m gonna hit it. You want to
come look for shells with me on the beach tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: I don’t want to scare away any tourists.</p>
<p><strong>sherrlene</strong>: Aw, sweetie, it’s winter. No tourists.
I’ll come get you in the morning. 1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Sherrlene collects her things, stands,
and kisses Beak on the side of his feathered head.</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: Goodnight, Sherrlene.</p>
<p><strong>sherrlene</strong>: Night, Beak. Sweet dreams. Sherrlene
closes the door behind her and Beak flips through the deck of cards,
preparing for another lonely night. A knock on the door.</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: You forget your purse? All right, all right,
I’m coming. He stands and opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: Show’s over, pal. VICTOR CREED is shrouded in
shadows, but when he grins his white fangs gleam. He drapes his arm
around Beak and drags the birdman inside the trailer.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Show’s never over for you, freak..</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: You want money? There’s twenty bucks on the
dresser. That’s all I</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: I just want to hear you talk a minute
before I cut your lungs out. Creed shoves Beak back into his seat, picks
up the bottle of bourbon, examines the label, and guzzles it. Beak opens
his mouth but no words come out. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: You’re the one that’s been killing mutants.
Creed wipes his lips with the back of his clawed hand. BEAK But you…
you’re one of us.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Us? There’s no us. There’s you and
there’s me, and in a minute, just me. Creed smiles down at his feathered
target. Beak tries to shield his body with his wings.</p>
<p><strong>beak</strong>: Please… I never hurt anybody, my whole
life…</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Let me show you how it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>logan.</strong>: Smells like government. Behind Logan, two
approaching men in dark suits and black overcoats glance at each other.
Logan, halving another block of wood, doesn’t turn around. One of the
newcomers, STRYKER, was a colonel in the Special Forces. He still has
the look. His hair is cropped short, his bearing is military, and his
blue eyes are fierce. f r_ONTTNTJF D</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CHRISTOPH NORD, A.K.A. AGENT ZERO, looks
more like a death row convict than a military man. A family of tattooed
spiders walk down his neck.</p>
<p>****: I even showered today. Logan turns, the axe gripped in his
hand. STRYKER Been a long time, Logan. You haven’t aged a day. Everyone
else gets old and gray, but not you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: We never lost you, my friend. I believe you
know my colleague? Logan and Agent Zero stare at each other. There is a
history between these two and clearly the memories are not fond. STRYKER
We’re with the Department of Agriculture now.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Agriculture? You working with farmers? Agent
Zero grins. There is nothing pleasant about his grin,.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Pest Control Division. Working with
exterminators.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Still shooting first, asking questions later?
In one blindingly fast motion, Agent Zero pulls a customized automatic
from his shoulder holster, fires, and reholsters.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Still smoking cheap cigars? Logan spits
the butt of the severed cigar from his mouth and clenches his fists.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That was a buck twenty-five, asshole. Stryker
holds up both hands, one palm to Logan, one to Zero.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Boys, please. Could we take a minute of
your time?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re taking it.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: We want you back. Logan turns away from
them. He tosses aside the axe, picks up a load of firewood and . stacks.
it beside the cabin. STRYKER You’re a born warrior. You can hide up here
as long as you want, that’s never gonna change.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: It’s… creative work, I can assure you of
that. And it pays well.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Already got a job.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Lumberjack. Eighteen grand a.year.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Eighteen five.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: You content chopping down trees?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah, I am. It’s good work. And I haven’t
killed anybody in three years.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Starting to miss it?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Right about now I am. Agent Zero grins,
enjoying the game. Stryker, seeing that this is going badly, tries to
break the tension.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: We’re putting together a team. Best men in
the business. Men with… special qualities. Men like you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Forget it. Logan walks around to the front of
the cabin. Stryker and Agent Zero follow. Logan’s battered old pickup
truck is parked beside the newcomers’ Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: It’s a team of hunters. We’re going after
some very bad people. Logan climbs into the driver’s seat. STRYKER You
read the papers, Logan? They’re killing mutants. Logan closes the door,
turns the key and revs the engine to warm it. Stryker taps on the
window. Logan grits his teeth and rolls down the window, not looking at
the colonel. STRYKER Listen to me. They have names. They have
addresses.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: All right, forget about yourself. Your
country needs you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m Canadian. He hits the gas, forcing
Stryker to jump back lest the tires run over his foot. Stryker and Agent
Zero watch him go.</p>
<p><strong>fourth graders</strong>: Get him! Logan jumps back around the
corner, out of sight. The fourth graders chase after him, round the
corner with their throwing hands cocked, ready to launch some serious
ice. Logan is nowhere in sight. The fourth graders turn in confused
circles, searching for their target, snowballs melting in their
hands.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hey, fellas. The boys and girls look up and
see Logan sitting on a second- floor window ledge. He has already formed
six perfect snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth
graders. The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with
Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Nice. Logan, caught with a snowball in his
hand, looks sheepish.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: They started it.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Stryker came by the house today.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Stryker? Colonel Stryker? The one you told me
about? What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Wants me back.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Told him no.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: So why can’t they get someone else? Logan
thinks about it for a moment. When he speaks there is a degree of
self-loathing in his tone.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m the best there is at what I do. And what
I do best isn’t very nice. Kayla studies the side of his face for a
moment. LOGAN Maybe he’s right. Maybe it’s the only thing I’m good for.
Kayla watches him. Logan shakes his head as if ridding himself of an
errant thought. LOGAN Son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a
minute. He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer. f
CONTTN11Fn1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LOGAN I’m not going anywhere. First time
in my life, I don’t feel like a freak.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Hey. You’re not a freak.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Most guys don’t have to worry about gutting
their girlfriend when they have a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You’re not a freak. You’ve got a gift.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: A gift? Logan shakes his head, staring at the
black ribbon of road. LOGAN You can return a gift..</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: The kids made cornhusk dolls today in Arts
and Crafts. She reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll. KAYLA I
made one for you. Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by
firelight. Given the limitations of the art form, it’s a skillful
representation of Logan, unique hairstyle and all.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I look like Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You’re Elvis with claws. The moon, swollen
and red-hued, rises above the dark hills, framed in the cabin’s window.
I coNTTNTTRn 1</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Full moon tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You know why the moon’s so lonely? Logan
shakes his head. Kayla lies back, resting her head on Logan’s leg as he
plays with her hair. KAYLA She used to have a lover. Kuekuatsheu. They
lived in the Spirit World and every night they’d wander the skies
together. But one of the other spirits was jealous. Trickster wanted the
Moon for himself. So he told Kuekuatsheu the Moon asked for flowers. He
told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Never trust a guy named Trickster.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Yeah, well, you do some stupid things when
you’re in love. Kuekuatsheu didn’t know that once you leave the Spirit
World, you can never go back. Now he’s trapped here. Every night the
Moon searches for him and every night he sees her in the sky and howls
her name… but he can never touch her again. For a moment they’re both
quiet, contemplating the sad myth.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Koo-koo-choo got screwed.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Kuekuatsheu. The Wolverine.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Be careful. Logan bends forward to kiss her
on the lips. He turns and walks towards a crew of LUMBERJACKS circled
around a SUPERVISOR with a clipboard. Logan turns when he hears a honk.
Kayla leans out the window. KAYLA I love you, by the way. Logan notices
that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this scene. He clears his
throat.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: T love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: We all love you, Casanova, but could we
get to work here? We need to let some daylight in the swamp. The
lumberjacks laugh loudly. Damage done, Kayla waves a cheerful goodbye
and drives away from the camp. Logan trudges into the circle of
lumberjacks, who make kissie- kissie sounds and slap his shoulder.
SUPERVISOR All right, I need a team of choppers for 3B, that’s gonna be
Phelan, Marcuse, Van Mier and Logan. Two teams for 3C…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: An eighteen-wheel flatbed loaded with
trimmed logs blocks the road. Men in reflective vests stand on the
flatbed, securing the load with chains. Kayla hits the brakes and
checks-her watch. She’s late. She taps the horn. A FOREMAN ambles over
to her, in no particular rush.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Can’t move the truck till the load’s tied
down.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Please? I’m already late.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Not gonna happen, ma’am… The foreman thinks
about it, sighs, and changes his tune. FOREMAN Hey Zeke! Pull this
mother over. Lady’s got to get through. Moments later the truck rolls
forward, enabling Kayla to scoot through in her pickup. She toots her
horn and waves.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Thanks, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>phelan</strong>: You all want to ease the pace a little bit?
Trees ain’t going anywhere. Logan, in the lead, stares at a crude smiley
face carved into a tall pine tree. His gaze travels from the carving to
something sitting on the forest floor.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PHELAN What you got there? The other
lumberjacks gather around Logan. A severed bear’s head, haloed by
buzzing flies, rots in the sun. PHELAN Goddamn.</p>
<p><strong>van mier</strong>: Hunter?</p>
<p><strong>marcuse</strong>: Why would a hunter leave the head?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Bullet didn’t kill this bear.</p>
<p>****: Claws did.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here,
Lolly Lolly Lolly got some adverbs here, Come on down to Lolly’s get the
adverbs here… Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly
collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the brakes and
the truck shudders to a halt. The man’s back is turned to the truck, his
head bowed. His hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if
he’s been sleeping in the woods for weeks. Kayla leans out of the open
truck window. Before she can speak, the man in the long black coat
turns. It’s not just his size that frightens us, though the man is
massive. It’s not just the four-inch-long black talons curling from his
fingertips, or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her. What
terrifies us most are his eyes. They are a shark’s eyes, black and
loveless and utterly inhuman. f CONTTNT1FD’</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Victor Creed walks toward the truck. He
scrapes his talons over the hood: screeeeee. Five parallel gashes now
scar the hood, carved straight through the steel.</p>
<p><strong>phelan</strong>: What’s the matter– Logan holds up a hand:
quiet. He hears a distant scream. A. voice he knows better than any
other. He runs, leaving his astonished co-workers behind. No one can run
through the woods faster than Logan and’Logan has never needed to run
faster. He vaults fallen trees, ducks under branches, accelerates when
he hits the access road.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Come on, you’re okay. Say something. Say
something, darling. Say something. Kayla, come on. He cradles her in his
arms. LOGAN You’re okay. You’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He rocks back and forth, her lifeless
body clutched tightly in his arms, his eyes clenched shut. The veins
bulge in his neck, every muscle in his body tenses, as if there were a
beast inside him trying to break free of his skin.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Stuff don’t work on me. I drink and
drink and I never feel any different. He downs the full glass of whiskey
with a swallow. He looks around the bar, at the pool table in the back,
the Wurlitzer jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor. VICTOR CREED You
got any insurance on this place?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Insurance? I guess so. Why? Creed wipes
his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: ’Cause it’s about to get ugly. Logan
walks into the tavern, sniffing the air. He sees Creed sitting on the
barstool, back to the door.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan approaches the bar, never taking
his eyes off creed. Finally Creed turns to look at Logan. He stands,
towering above the smaller man. Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on
the back of Creed’s hand. Creed knows Logan is looking at it. He lifts
his hand to his mouth and licks the blood off. VICTOR CREED Sweet girl.
Tasted like strawberry jam. The bone claws burst from Logan’s hands,
pale, white, and serrated. He growls and swings at Creed’s head. The big
man is fast. He ducks under the claws, grinning and circling like a
boxer, happy that he’s finally got a decent adversary. The bartender and
the local drunks have seen plenty of bar fights, but not ones featuring
clawed mutants. They run. VICTOR CREED You can scare off the civilians
with those, sonny boy. But I got claws of my own. He swings, raking his
talons across Logan’s chest, drawing first blood. Logan lunges at Creed
and the battle begins. -The pace of the combat is startling, the
physical power stupendous. A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing
out the guts of the jukebox. Logan jumps at his enemy and gets swatted
into the wall, smashing the plasterboard. Creed grabs Logan by the
collar and tosses him onto the pool table. Creed brings his fist down,
looking to pulverize Logan’s skull, but the smaller man rolls clear.
Creed’s fist shatters the slate and the table collapses. Clearing his
head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the eight ball rolling past. He
picks it up and hurls it at Creed’s head. Creed catches the eight ball
in his left hand and squeezes his fist shut. He opens his hand and lets
the powdered remains spill onto the floor. Logan springs to his feet and
swings at creed, again and again, his claws whooshing through the
air.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Creed, despite his bulk, is an elegant
fighter. He circles just out of reach, grinning as the claws slash past
his face. Creed grabs Logan’s right wrist as it flies by. He grabs the
left wrist. His wet fangs glisten as they plunge toward Logan’s
throat.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: With no room to dodge, Logan drives his head
forward, smashing Creed’s face with a glorious headbutt.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: As Creed staggers back, Logan kicks him in the
chest, knocking the big man over the bar, where he crashes into the
bottles of liquor and slides to the floor in a tumult of glass shards
and alcohol. Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the
tables. He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar. The cigarette
ignites the spilt alcohol. Creed roars and rises to his feet, a burning
man. He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan. The flames consume
his overcoat, licking at his skin. Creed slaps them out with his palms,
apparently oblivious to the pain. VICTOR CREED You put up a better fight
than your girl did. Creed snatches Logan and slings him headfirst
through the plate glass window.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Time you got declawed, kitty kat.
Creed lifts his heavy black boot and brings it down hard on the extended
claws of Logan’s left hand.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan howls as the-bone claws shatter.
Creed repeats the process on Logan’s right hand. VICTOR CREED. You were
a tough little guy. But there’s always someone tougher. Creed plunges
his clawed hand into Logan’s chest. Logan gasps, eyes widening. His
tolerance for pain is world-class but this is another level of
suffering. VICTOR CREED And it’s always me. Creed stands, staring down
at Logan’s unmoving body. Sirens moan in the distance. Creed walks away.
Logan bleeds in the snow. We rise above him, higher and higher, his
battered body dwindling as we rise with the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: We know what we’re looking at?</p>
<p><strong>male nurse #1.</strong>: Bar fight.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse #2</strong>: Multiple knife wounds.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan lunges forward, grabbing the
surgeon’s collar and pulling the startled man’s face next to his
own.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>male nurse #1</strong>: Hey, hey, easy– The male nurses
struggle to restrain Logan but he’s too strong for them. The surgeon
gasps for air.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: His name is Victor Creed. Logan turns and
sees Stryker standing at the entrance to the operating room. STRYKER I
can help you find him.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in
Nevada last year. Started murdering mutants. Shape- changer in New
Mexico, pair of telekinetic twins in California– Logan turns on Stryker,
grabbing the colonel by the throat and shoving him against a lamp
post.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Three years I been here. Three years
everything’s good. Nobody knows me. And then one day you show up and the
next day she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: I came to warn you–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You knew he was coming. f CONTTNfJRD 1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stryker shakes his head as well as he
can with Logan’s hand on his throat. Stryker’s face is turning red.
LOGAN How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: He got the List.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What list? Stryker chokes, gasping for air.
Logan eases up on his grip but doesn’t release the man. Stryker takes a
deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: The List. Every known mutant in North
America. Government’s been keeping it for years. Names, addresses,
everything.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How did he get it?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Someone must have leaked it to him. There
are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed. Logan
releases Stryker. The ex-colonel straightens his jacket collar and
composes himself.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Creed’s a mutant, too.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Apparently he doesn’t have much tribal
loyalty. Logan turns and walks away. He looks like a homeless man, his
clothes torn and bloodied, his hair disheveled. He walks fast. Stryker
calls after him. STRYKER Do you have a plan, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m not in the Army anymore.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Do you have a plan? CnNTTNT TF.Tf 1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan turns and stares at Stryker.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m gonna track him down and I’m gonna end
him. That’s the plan.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: You already tried that. He’s a hundred
miles away and you’re walking out of the hospital. Logan’s fists are
clenched. He’s ready to hammer Stryker into the ground, but the older
man does not back down. STRYKER You can’t beat him. Not the way you are
right now. You’ve probably gone your whole life without losing a fight,
but I’m telling you now, you can’t beat him.</p>
<p>****: Unless I give you the tools. Logan glares at Stryker, still
itching for immediate revenge. STRYKER You come with me, I promise you
two things. You will suffer more pain than any other man could bear. And
you will have your revenge. Logan stares into Stryker’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A red-bearded scientist, DR. CORNELIUS,
draws blood from Logan with a syringe. An Army surgeon, CAROL HINES,
marks Logan’s skin with an indelible pen. He looks like a Maori warrior,
his body mapped with strange lines, dots and x’s. Stryker watches Hines
work.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Could you unsheath your claws? Logan raises
his left hand. The bone claws pop out, the same length they were before
Creed shattered them. STRYKER Remarkable. Full regeneration. Logan
examines the markings on his forearm.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The hell you planning on doing to me? Hines
gives Stryker a worried look but he ignores her.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: We’re going to make you indestructible. But
first we have to destroy you. Stryker heads for the door but stops
midway and turns. STRYKER I forgot to give you something. He reaches
into his jacket pocket, pulls out an old set of dog tags and tosses them
to Logan. Logan inspects the tags with ambivalence.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Never wanted to put these on again.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Held on to them for years. Figured you’d be
back one day. Logan slips the steel chain over his head. STRYKER</p>
<p>****: Now you’ll always know your name.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Sir? Stryker stops and waits.for her to catch
up. HINES I know we’ve discussed this before– He knows what she’s going
to say. He shakes his head and continues down the hallway, forcing Hines
to chase after him.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Ad nauseam, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Anesthetic won’t work on him. His healing
factor neutralizes drugs. Including painkillers.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: He can handle the pain.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: We’ve never conducted any animal</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: No other animal would survive the
experiment.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: He might not, either. There’s a significant
chance the procedure will kill him.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Correct. Some experiments succeed, some
fail. That’s why we call them “experiments.”</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: The man’s well-being is not my concern.
Proving that the science works– that’s what matters. Hines does not
relish confrontation and she’s afraid of Stryker. But she gives it one
more try.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Sir… I took the Hippocratic Oath. I swore I’d
never intentionally harm another human being. Stryker turns on Hines,
jabbing his finger at her.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: You also swore. to protect your nation. You
remember that oath, Lieutenant Hines?</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Yes sir, but I don’t understand why-</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: I don’t need you to understand. I need you
to follow orders. Stryker continues down the corridor, leaving Hines
standing alone in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You ready for me, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: An array of stainless-steel machines
crowds around the tank, including a series of robotic arms that taper
into foot-long needles. One wall of the theater is glass. Behind the
glass is the control room, where Stryker looks on, hands behind his
back. Dr. Cornelius and several SUPPORT STAFF enter data into computers
monitoring the experiment. Logan removes his robe and hands it to Hines
before stepping into the tank of water.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: See you on’the other side. One of the
technicians fastens a breathing tube, connected to an oxygen tank, to
Logan’s mouth. Logan lies down, submerging himself in the cold water.
The technician clamps Logan’s wrists and ankles into place with
stainless-steel shackles bolted to the plexiglass walls. Logan’s eyes
are open as he watches the robotic arms swivel into place, poised above
him like a gang of metal vipers.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Adamantium temperature?</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: Steady at eighty-two eleven.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Feed lines clear?</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: Lines one through twelve clear.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Prepare insertion.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Commence feed. The technicians enter
commands, watching close-up images of the procedure on their
monitors.</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: Feed commenced at a rate of twenty
nine cc’s per second.</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: Density probe indicates preliminary
chelation of the compact tissue.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Body temperature?</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: One zero two point three.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Heart rate?</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: One sixty.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: You’re witnessing medical history in the
making. We’ve begun bonding adamantium to Weapon X’s skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>general munson i</strong>: We tried to use that stuff for
tank armor. Too damn expensive.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: It took us three years to prepare enough
alloy for the skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: So if this works, I guess Weapon X
won’t be walking through any metal detectors.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: If this works, General, Weapon X will walk
wherever he wants.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Heart rate one ninety.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Density?</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: Four four seven. CLOSE on Logan’s
clenched eyelids and CLOSER still, entering the mind of the tortured
man. Horrific images flicker past, selected traumas from a deeply
traumatic life. Logan cradles the lifeless body of Kayla Silverfox. The
feral boy stares at his monstrous claws and howls. Logan stands in a
village in Vietnam as bamboo huts-burn around him.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: How long before he’s mission
operative?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Remains to be seen. We’re in uncharted
territory here.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: Uncharted territory is a pretty good
description of your budget, Colonel. This doesn’t work, you can kiss the
Eleven good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: We need the Eleven. Our victory in the war
to come depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: Not everyone in the Pentagon thinks
there’s gonna be a war. Stryker turns and fixes his gaze on the
general.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Oh, it’s coming, General. The enemy walks
among us. We’d better be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Body temperature one zero eight. Heart rate
two ten. Sir– A dying Russian lies on his back on a dock in Odessa,
staring at the sky, his shirt punctured with three precise holes. Logan
stares down at him, bone claws extended. 1</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: He’s a warrior, Hines. He can handle it.
Victor Creed plunges his clawed hand into Logan’s gut.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Density?</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: Probe rejected, sir.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: Is there a problem? Stryker allows
himself a small smile.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: On the contrary. The probe is
diamond-tipped. It’s not hard enough to penetrate adamantium.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Heart rate two twenty five. Sir, we’re well
beyond maximum–</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: You’re trained to care for humans, Doctor.
Weapon X is not one of us.</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: Chelation near completion.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Heart rate two forty four… two fifty… two
fifty seven…</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: Adamantiumreservoir ninety percent
depleted.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Core temperature one hundred and nineteen
degrees. .A young Stryker, wearing jungle fatigues and a necklace of
human ears, holds a revolver to the temple of a sobbing Viet Cong
prisoner. Stryker smiles as he pulls the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Easy now.</p>
<p><strong>tsurgical theater - continuous �.., .,.</strong>: Adamantium
claws burst from Logan’s hand, shimmering underwater. Crazed with pain,
he carves through the walls of the plexiglass tank. Steaming water
cascades onto the poured concrete floor. Bursting free of his
restraints, Logan slashes through the robotic arms. Sparks dance like a
swarm of fireflies. The dismembered machines twitch like wounded beasts.
Logan rises from the broken tank, drenched with water, naked save for
dozens of long stainless steel needles drilled into his body and the
wires and hoses trailing from the needles. Hair matted to his head, eyes
wild, face contorted, he looks like a strange amalgam of machine and
animal. He tears the breathing tube from his mouth and stares through
the window into the control room, panting, claws extended.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The general stares at Logan, awed by the
sight of the living weapon. Even Agent Zero no longer looks bored.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: I take it this is still part of the
plan, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: He’s got nowhere to run. Closed circuit
monitors show Logan running down a tunnel. STRYKER The only exit is a 25
ton blast door. It was built to withstand a nuclear detonation.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Alert the containment team. Bring him
back.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Bagged or breathing?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Either way. Just bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His face is close to the wolf’s face and
they stare into each other’s eyes, predator to predator. Snikt! Logan
presses the claws of his left hand to the wolf’s throat. The wolf quits
fighting, mewling submissively. He goes slack in Logan’s grip, rolling
over to signal surrender. Logan stands over the newly-subservient alpha
wolf. The other wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion.
Intense light shines on Logan’s face. He turns and sees that he’s
surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS wearing tactical armor. Powerful
flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their guns, which are pointed
at Logan. The wolves flee, dodging through the pines, their paws kicking
up snow.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: Put your hands in the air!</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: These soldiers are the creme de la creme.
They’re equipped to handle the situation.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: Hands in the air, now! Logan charges at
the soldiers. The soldiers fire their weapons. These are not rifles but
high-powered Tasers. Twelve darts sink into Logan’s skin, each connected
to a silvery wire. Thousands of volts of electricity course through
Logan’s body. NTTNIJF.n</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Gritting his teeth and fighting through
the pain, he slices the twelve wires with his claws and advances on the
stunned soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: The creme de la creme just got creamed.
Stryker gives her a very nasty look before turning to General Munson and
speaking in calming tones.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: There’s a high-voltage fence on the
perimeter of the base–</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: Is it made out of adamantium?</p>
<p><strong>heather hudson</strong>: Marge’ll probably make her walnut
pie again. I thought I’d do meringues this year. Try something
different. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>heather hudson</strong>: You like my meringues, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p>****: Yep. Yep. Forty years of conversation, all I get is yeps.
Heather grabs her husband’s arm. HEATHER HUDSON Jimmy! James turns in
time to see a naked man sprint across the snow and slip inside a red
sheep barn. HEATHER HUDSON I think there’s a naked man in the barn.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: .yep.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: Son… What in hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sorry… It’s a little cold out there.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: Uh huh. It’s the middle of January and
you got no clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That’s probably it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hudson sighs and lowers his shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: You’re not on the drugs, are you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: Just had a rough night?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Pretty rough, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: All right, come on. I got some old
clothes’ll probably fit you. He turns and Logan begins covering
strategic places with wads of straw. JAMES HUDSON I’ll take you around
back so my wife don’t see you again.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sorry if I scared her.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: Scared her?</p>
<p>****: I’m not worried about you scaring her.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: You mind if I ask where you came
running from?</p>
<p><strong>heather hudson</strong>: Jimmy. Let the boy eat. Logan piles
eggs onto a slice of buttered toast.</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: I’m just wondering. We’re twenty miles
from town. It’s a miracle you didn’t get hypothermia out there.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’ve got good circulation. Nice chopper you
got out there, by the way. James’s face lights up. Logan has found the
man’s passion.,</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: You know motorcycles?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What is it, ’48 Panhead?</p>
<p><strong>james hudson</strong>: Best bike Harley-Davidson ever made.
First one with a seventy-four- cubic inch engine, hydraulic valve
lifters, aluminum heads– Heather stands to clear the plates.</p>
<p><strong>heather hudson</strong>: Now you’ve got him started. You need
more of anything? Logan, smiling, holds up his hands to surrender. The
smile fades when he sees the red laser dot appear on Heather’s shirt.
HEATHER HUDSON What’s the matter, honey? Logan dives across the table,
trying to knock her out of the way, but the bullet beats him there,
punching through the window frame and straight through Heather Hudson’s
heart. She collapses in Logan’s arms.</p>
<p><strong>get down!</strong>: But it’s too late. A second bullet hits
James in the back; the farmer blinks and topples forward, dead before he
hits -the ground.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Weapon X is in the farmhouse. He just
murdered.two civilians.. Fire at will. An APACHE LONGBOW helicopter
streaks overhead, fifty feet above the ground.</p>
<p><strong>gunner’s eyepiece pov</strong>: The farmhouse is centered in
the crosshairs. Scrolling numbers to the side of the image indicate the
range in meters. The gunner’s finger tightens on the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>int_ kitchen - continuous</strong>: Logan growls and runs for
the door.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Direct hit.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Locate the target and fire again.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Sir… the target’s destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Repeat: locate the target and fire
again.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: They must’ve hated this guy big time. 1</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: What was he, terrorist or something?</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: I don’t know but he’s a puddle now.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Jesus! Logan raises his right hand and
plunges his claws through the bulletproof glass.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Your boy just took down fifty million
dollars worth of hardware. Guess I got to do this myself.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Negative. Come back to base.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Have a little faith, boss.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: You don’t have the weaponry…</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: Don’t care what kind of bones he’s got.
Fifty caliber bullet through his eyeball ought to do it.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Nord, goddamnit–</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: I’m losing you, boss. Agent Zero clicks
off his headset and.raises the sniper rifle, searching through the smoke
with his scope. AGENT ZERO Come out and play…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan accelerates and opens up thirty
yards of breathing room. He turns and sees Agent Zero catching up again.
Logan clamps on the brakes, hard. He holds out his left hand and extends
his claws. The tips of the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly. The
SUV cannot brake in time. As it hurtles past the motorcycle, Logan’s
claws hit the SUV’s front tire and shred it instantly. A split-second
later he shreds the rear tire. The SUV totters, falls to its side, and
barrel rolls across the empty road. It ends up on its roof in a drainage
ditch, wheels still spinning in the air. Logan turns his bike and pulls
up next to the upended SUV. He lowers the kickstand, stands, and walks
to the driver’s side. Agent Zero, bloodied and dazed, has managed to
push open the door. He leans out and aims his shotgun at Logan, who
slices the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws. Logan
grabs Agent Zero by the back of the neck and hauls him out of the
car.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Those were good people back there. Innocent
people. Agent Zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a sheath
on his ankle.</p>
<p><strong>agent zero</strong>: You ever notice good people tend to die
when they spend time with you? He swings the knife at the side of
Logan’s neck.`Logan catches Agent Zero’s wrist and slams it against the
door frame. Agent Zero drops the knife with a pained smile. He didn’t
think that would work. AGENT ZERO Maybe you should stick with the bad
people. We’re more your speed.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I got a message for your boss.</p>
<p>****: Yeah? Tell me. The smirk fades from Zero’s face as he sees the
adamantium claws plunging toward his heart.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Get me the Pest Control Division.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, there is no Pest Control
Division.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Why don’t you get ’em anyway. And tell ’em
Logan’s calling. While he waits he watches one of the kids attempt a
backside tailslide on the curb. The kid loses his balance and wipes out,
skinning his palms on the asphalt.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You shouldn’t have killed those people. All
they were doing was helping a stranger.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: You ran on me, goddamnit. We had a deal.
Now you get back to base–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: They had nothing to do with this. You let
that mad dog gun ’em down like they were animals.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: I’m giving you an order, soldier! Return
tobase–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Had enough orders for one lifetime.</p>
<p>****: I’m going after Victor Creed. For several seconds there is
silence on the line.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: We’re bringing you in. One way or another,
we’re bringing you in. Logan bows his head, considering his next
words.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: People like you are always waiting for the
next war. You start one with me, Colonel, you better sleep with the
lights on. He hangs up the phone and walks to his bike. The skateboard
punks give him a wide berth.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They congregate in a small wooden hut
with a peaked roof, where they scamper up and down the back of FRANCIS,
a slender, balding man in a zoo keeper’s uniform. Francis has a gentle
smile as he feeds the lemurs leaf-eater biscuits. He speaks to them as
they shriek,: clambering over his lap, biscuits clutched in their tiny
hands.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: She did what? Ninna, that wasn’t very nice.
He gives one of the female lemurs an admonishing look. She shrieks and
dances away, biscuit held to her chest. FRANCIS You must have done
something to deserve it, Myrto. Oh, you bit her? Why? Haven’t we talked
about this? The lemurs all quiet down at the same time. Francis watches
them. Something is wrong. The lemurs flee, ducking into holes in the
baobab trees, hiding from whatever’s coming. Francis frowns and turns.
Victor Creed stands above him.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Everyone thinks you’re a lunatic,
talking to animals. But I know you’re not, Francis. You understand them,
don’t you? That’s your power. Francis looks for help but there is no one
in sight. VICTOR CREED What do they tell you? Francis is quiet for a few
seconds, staring at the killer.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Nothing very fancy. They tell me when
they’re scared. When they’re angry. When they’re hungry.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: You ever talk to a panther, Francis?
Francis shakes his head. 1</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: There are no mistakes. We’re all part of
the plan. We’re all God’s children. Creed grins, licking his sharp
fangs.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: I don’t know who my Daddy was, but it
sure as Hell wasn’t God. Francis bows his head.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I’m not afraid of dying. Creed runs one
long claw across Francis’s cheek.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: How do you know? You’ve never done it
before.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Ninna the ring-tailed lemur mewls softly,
trying to hide herself deep within the baobab tree as her human
friend</p>
<p><strong>lady of the night</strong>: You look like a man who could use
a night off. 1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan turns to look at a REDHEAD in a
tight silver dress, waiting at the light in her Cadillac convertible.
She looks like she’s expensive, and she looks like she’d be worth
it.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re way out of my league, darlin’.</p>
<p><strong>lady of the night</strong>: You never know. You looking for a
good time with a bad woman? Logan smiles and shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Not tonight. The redhead purses her lips.</p>
<p><strong>lady of the night</strong>: You don’t know what you’re
missing. Logan revs his engine as the light changes.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I know exactly what I’m missing. The
courtesan waits at the green light,. watching Logan speed off into the
night -</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: This is a contact sport, ladies. If you
don’t like hitting people, try golf. Logan comes up behind Wraith,
unseen by the Texan..</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You talk tough for a guy who always let me do
the dirty work. A slow smile creases Wraith’s face. He turns.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: Look at this. You never get old, do you? The
two men’embrace. There is genuine affection here, the camaraderie of men
who have fought together, bled together. WRAITH Nobody followed you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You tryin’ to insult me?</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: Can’t be too careful, brother. I’ve been
retired five years I still check under the car every time I drive.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m looking for Victor Creed. Wraith’s face
goes serious at the mention of the name. He looks around the gym, making
sure no one’s watching them. He glances at the boxers in the ring, who
lean on the ropes and breathe heavily, awaiting instructions.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: Why don’t you two get a manicure or
something and meet me back here in the morning. Want a beer?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Wraith leads Logan toward an office in
the back, draping an arm around his shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: I love you like a brother. So I’m giving you
thirty minutes. After that, you’re too dangerous to know.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: What I hear, our friend the Colonel’s got
eyes all over the country looking for you. He ain’t about to let Weapon
X go rogue on him. Wraith pops the caps off the beer bottles and hands
one to Logan.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What’s Weapon X? They tap glass.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: You are. A walking, talking, hundred-million
dollar experiment.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You know about it. Wraith sits behind his
desk and puts his boots up. Logan sits across from him.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: I keep my ear to the ground. People like us,
we never really quit the game.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I did. Woke up one day and knew I was done.
Logan peels the label from his bottle of beer.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LOGAN Stryker used to give me a new name
every Monday. And by the end of the week, I’d draw a line through
it.</p>
<p>****: I .put a whole lot of people under the ground. And one day I
realized… Stryker was never gonna run out of names. Wraith nods,
meditative.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: Our friend the Colonel has big plans.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What kind of plans?</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: Hear a lot of chatter about something called
the Eleven. My boys in Arlington say it’s the biggest covert weapons
project since FDR built himself an atom bomb. Other than that, no one
knows a goddamn thing. Wraith places his bottle on his desk and sits up
straight in his chair. WRAITH Look, I… I heard about what happened to
your woman. For what it’s worth, I’m sorry. Logan nods. He doesn’t want
to talk about it. WRAITH I did a little contract work with Creed back in
the day. I’ve known some seriously foul people, but that cat… They say
he took out a whole village in Nicaragua one time, every man, woman, and
child, killed ’em all, just ’cause he was bored.</p>
<p>****: I been screwed, sued, and tattooed, but I never killed no
kids.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Creed did government work?</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: Till they got wise to him. Wherever he went
there was a trail of bodies. And not always the right bodies, you know
what I’m saying? There is murder in Logan’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Help me find him.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: He’s a hard cat to track.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Just tell me where to start looking. I’ll do
the rest. Wraith taps the bottleneck, considering.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: Might want to talk to his friends from the
ultramax.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The prison he busted out of?</p>
<p>****: Feds built it to hold the baddest of the bad mutants. Worked
pretty well. Only problem– now they all know each other.</p>
<p>****: You ever hear of a guy named Fred J. Dukes?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: People call him the Blob. You find him,
you’ll know why. Got out of the hoosegow a few months ago. Went home to
Iowa. Town called Elgin.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You think he’s still in touch with Creed?
1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Wraith leans back in his chair and
allows himself another slow smile.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: I bet you’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>insert television</strong>: A REPORTER stands in a Detroit
alleyway as POLICE OFFICERS in the background cordon off the area from
ONLOOKERS.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: This is the 13th confirmed mutant slaying
of the last two months, and with the investigation apparently stalled,
members of the mutant community are voicing their outrage. A YOUNG WOMAN
wearing a “Mutants are Humans, Too” t-shirt speaks passionately for the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Of course there’s bias at work here. If
these were normal people getting. chopped up, you better believe there’d
be an FBI Task Force investigating, there’d be all sorts of resources
allocated to find this killer. Why is it that when violence is done to
our community, the nation turns its back?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: YOUNG WOMAN If the government can’t
protect us, we’re gonna have to start protecting ourselves. In the
corner of the TV screen, carved directly into the brick wall of the
alley, is a crude smiley face.</p>
<p><strong>end insert</strong>: Logan’s expression does not change as he
watches the report. Our only indications that he’s boiling inside are
the look of dark vengeance in his eyes, and the fingers of his right
hand, which clench into a fist, unclench, clench again. He lowers the
volume with the remote, picks up the telephone and dials a number. We
hear four rings.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Hey, you’ve reached Kayla and Logan. We’re
not home right now so please leave a message after the beep and we’ll
get back to you as soon as we can. Bye! Beep. Logan replaces the
receiver in its cradle and’ lies back, alone in the world.</p>
<p><strong>stock boy #1</strong>: Say something.</p>
<p><strong>stock boy #2</strong>: You say something. It’s your
section!</p>
<p><strong>stock boy #1</strong>: Dude… The stock boy peeks around the
divider. FRED J. DUKES, a.k.a., THE BLOB, stands in the center of the
aisle, tearing open bags of pork rinds and pouring them down his gullet.
Dukes is the biggest man you’ve ever seen. By a long shot. Just shy of
seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton, he’s beyond fat. Beyond
obese. His eyes look like pinpricks in the swollen enormity of his face.
When he shifts his bulk, ripples cascade down his flanks, his flesh
trembling with each breath.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Jesus, Dukes… Dukes, mouth and chin dusted
with fried pork skin, turns his head to examine the pest standing next
to him. LOGAN Maybe it’s time to give the pork rinds a rest. Dukes
swings his arm. Despite his enormous mass, the man moves with surprising
speed. Not quick enough to catch Logan, though, who ducks beneath the
blow. Dukes’s forearm, thicker than a fire hydrant, smashes through the
steel shelving. Bags of pork rinds and potato chips tumble to the floor.
Snikt! Logan shows his glittering claws to the big man. LOGAN I’ll
fillet you standing, fat man. That what you want? Dukes hesitates. That
is not what he wants., LOGAN .Where’s Victor Creed? Dukes grunts and
bulls forward, toppling the heavily-laden shelves into the next aisle.
Panicked SHOPPERS scream and run for the exits. Dukes blasts through the
cereal aisle, too, with a great rending of steel, his giant shoes
crushing boxes of Lucky Charms as he stomps into the produce section.
1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A coconut bounces off Dukes’s head.
Enraged, the giant turns and sees Logan standing by a pile of hairy
coconuts, tossing one in his hand like a baseball. LOGAN You’re gonna
help me, bub. You_just don’t know it yet. Dukes bellows and runs at
Logan. A coconut pelts him in the face, angering him further. Logan
jumps out of the way as Dukes brings down his massive fists. Coconuts
explode. Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked
grapefruits, clusters of bananas. After a thirty second rampage Dukes is
exhausted, his giant chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and
face splattered with remnants of crushed fruit. Logan jumps onto Dukes’
back. The fat man roars and spins around, trying to buck the little
rider, but Logan’s got one arm wrapped around Dukes’ throat and he’s not
letting go. The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down.
Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow’s face, reflecting the
overhead fluorescent lights. Dukes quits, his massive shoulders
slumping. He sinks to his knees, his great bulk splitting the linoleum
floor. Logan presses his claws against Dukes’ quivering jowls. LOGAN
Where’s Creed?</p>
<p><strong>fred j. dukes</strong>: How the hell would I know?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Come on, he’s your friend. When was the last
time you talked to him?</p>
<p><strong>fred j. dukes</strong>: Friend? He don’t have any friends.
All he’s got is victims.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Careful, Dukes. I can smell a lie before you
even tell it. The Blob begins to cry, the great bellows of his cheeks
trembling, tears and snot dribbling down his face.</p>
<p><strong>fred j. dukes</strong>: I’m not lying! I don’t know where he
is. Logan pulls a handkerchief out of his back pocket and hands it to
Dukes.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: All right, take it easy. Dukes blows his nose
into the handkerchief, one of history’s loudest and most violent nasal
ejaculations. He offers back the soiled handkerchief. Logan waves it
off. LOGAN It’s a gift. Dukes takes a deep breath, gathering
himself.</p>
<p><strong>fred j. dukes</strong>: You ever been to Superior?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The club for mutants? Down in New
Orleans?</p>
<p><strong>fred j. dukes</strong>: Creed likes to party down there.
Talked about it all the time– how hot the girlies were. That’s all I
know. Logan shaves Dukes’ jaw with the edge of his claw.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Nah. You know more than that. Dukes tilts his
face, trying to keep his face from getting scraped off.</p>
<p><strong>fred j. dukes</strong>: Joint’s owned by a guy named
Barbarus. Shared a cell with Creed in the ultramax. Anyone knows where
to find him, it’s Barbarus. Logan stares into the Blob’s face, gauging
the man’s words.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He better be there, Freddie. And he better
know something good.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LOGAN ’Cause I’m in a mood for violence
and you’re way too big to hide.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: we have information that he was in Las
Vegas two nights ago. We’ll find him soon.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: This is turning into a goddamn
disaster, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: I disagree. I’d say the experiment has been
a success.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: Success? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Weapon X is a prototype. Nothing more. He’s
the walking proof that enhanced skeletons are viable. That, along with
the healing factor we’ve replicated from his blood, will insure that the
Eleven is capable of protecting our species from extinction.</p>
<p>****: At this point, Logan is merely an inconvenience. He won’t be
for long.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: I’m sorry, William. I’ve lost
confidence in your leadership. I’m going to recommend your dismissal to
the Joint Chiefs. Stryker stares out the window at the distant lake,
with no visible reaction to the General’s words.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Disappointing, General. Expected, but
still… disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: General Munson takes a sip of water from
the glass in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>general munson</strong>: I know you believe in what you’re
doing. But I don’t. War with the mutants is not inevitable. The general
coughs. He begins to look confused as he coughs again, his breathing
gone suddenly ragged. He clutches at his chest. A thin smile curls
Stryker’s lips. He turns to regard the General.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: You’re having a massive heart attack, sir.
Leading cause of death for men in your age bracket. The general gasps
for air, trying to rise to his feet. In his death throes, he knocks the
glass of water from the table. It shatters on the floor. STRYKER. The
war is coming. It’s time to choose sides. The general collapses-and
Stryker stands above him, staring down at the dying man with pitiless
eyes. STRYKER You chose treason.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: You superior? Only when we go CLOSE ON THE
BOUNCER do we realize he has a single eye, large and bloodshot, centered
in his forehead.. Logan raises both hands. Snikt! A single claw extends
from his right hand.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He shoves the claw straight through his
left palm, retracts the blade, and shows his wounded palm to the
bouncer. The bouncer sees the wound heal and opens the door. BOUNCER
Welcome home, brother.</p>
<p><strong>pusher</strong>: You lookin’ for help, man? Ups, downs,
in-betweens. What you need?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Wild roses for the moon.</p>
<p><strong>pusher</strong>: Wild roses… That some new hash out of
Amsterdam?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Something like that. You seen my buddy
Barbarus? The dealer points toward a staircase at the back of the
club.</p>
<p><strong>pusher</strong>: VIP room. But hold up,bro,.I got what you’re
looking for.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Trust me, bub– you don’t. Logan heads for the
staircase.</p>
<p><strong>skinhead</strong>: Private party.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m on the list. Logan. The skinhead raises
his clipboard and examines the list.</p>
<p><strong>skinhead</strong>: Last name? Logan’s fist splits the
clipboard and crushes the skinhead’s nose. The muscle-bound brute slumps
to the floor, unconscious. Logan steps over him and into the VIP
room.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Unknown.</p>
<p><strong>barbarus</strong>: Oh, I heard about this li’l fella.
Mr. Creed beat him to hell.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I came back. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>barbarus</strong>: Somewhere in America. Doing what he does
best.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>barbarus</strong>: Putting people’s insides on the
outside.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: He’s killing mutants, bub. Barbarus smiles,
twenty fingers drumming on the table top.</p>
<p><strong>barbarus</strong>: Some mutants need killing.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You got that right. Snikt! Barbarus shoves
his girlfriend out of the way and stands, unsheathing three more black
commando knives from his belt. The other MUTANTS quiet down, watching
the fireworks. Barbarus swings, the four knives whistling through the
air. Logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as Barbarus
advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel. Logan slashes and one
severed hand falls to the ground. Barbarus howls, stabbing at Logan with
his three good arms. Logan’s claws flash through the air again, and
another neatly severed hand lands on the table. Logan retracts his claws
and curls one finger: come at me. Barbarus, shamed and furious, gathers
himself and charges. Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the
ball of his foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like
a well-hit baseball. Barbarus crashes to the floor. Pantera hisses and
pounces at Logan, her black claws aimed at his face. Logan backhands
her. She hits the floor and slides across the hardwood.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan kneels beside Barbarus. LOGAN You
want to keep your other hands? Where is he? Blood dribbles from
Barbarus’s lip. He spits out a tooth.</p>
<p><strong>barbarus</strong>: He don’t sent me postcards.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No? Way I hear it, you two were practically
boyfriends before he busted out.</p>
<p><strong>barbarus</strong>: Busted out?</p>
<p>****: You been misinformed. Victor Creed got himself a government
pardon. Some fellas from the Department of Agriculture came and picked
him up.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re lying to me. Barbarus grins, his teeth
red from the blood in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>barbarus</strong>: No, sir. But somebody is.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: You think I’d use a bomb on you,
Johnny Boy? Wraith spins around. Victor Creed sits on a concrete
parapet, the desert wind blowing his filthy blonde hair. He hops off the
parapet and walks toward Wraith.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: VICTOR CREED It’s all about human
contact for me. Wraith quickly unlocks the car door and get in. He slips
the key into the ignition. The engine turns on the first try. Wraith
hits the gas and the Mustang squeals out in reverse. He slams on the
brakes, shifts into drive, and guns the car right at Creed. An instant
before impact, Creed sidesteps the car and punches through the driver’s
window. It’s a miracle of a punch, timed perfectly, a crushing shot to
Wraith’s jaw. Wraith loses control. of the car and it sideswipes a
parked Hummer, spinning to a stop against a concrete wall. Wraith blinks
and tries to clear his head. Creed reaches inside the broken window and
hauls the Texan out. He lifts the bleeding man into the air and flashes
his white fangs. VICTOR CREED Hear you been talking out of school.</p>
<p><strong>wraith</strong>: He’ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: That’s the plan. It’s a lot easier
than finding him. Creed slams Wraith against the concrete wall and
plunges his claws deep into Wraith’s gut. The Texan’s mouth opens as the
full force of the pain hits him. Creed whispers in his ear. VICTOR CREED
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy. A sickening crunch as vertebrae are
crushed like walnut shells. VICTOR CREED Never knew you had one. Creed
drops Wraith’s body to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Pour yourself a cup of tea. Hines spins
around. Logan sits at the kitchen table, an unlit cigar in his mouth.
LOGAN It’s gonna be a long night.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Careful, Doc. I can smell a lie. I can hear
it. Maybe you start to sweat a little bit. Maybe the pitch of your voice
changes. But I’ll know.</p>
<p>****: Tell me about Creed. Hines opens her mouth, closes it, opens it
again.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: I can’t. Please… you don’t know what they’ll
do to me.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Nope. But I know exactly what I’ll do to you.
I</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hines stares at Logan and he stares
back.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: I don’t believe you. You’re different than
they are. You wouldn’t hurt an innocent person.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re not innocent, Doc. He leans forward,
forearms on the tabletop. LOGAN What does Victor Creed have to do with
the Weapon X program?</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: It’s not the Weapon X program, it’s the
Weapon Ultra program. Started sixty-five years ago. They’ve been trying
to make the perfect soldier for a long time. First to fight the Nazis.
Then the Communists. Now it’s mutants.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: So where does Weapon X fit in? Hines closes
her eyes and takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: You don’t understand. X is a letter but it’s
also a Roman numeral. Weapon “Ex” is a nickname. Officially, you’re
Weapon Ten.</p>
<p>****: Victor Creed is Weapon Nine. Hines watches him, unsure how
he’ll react. HINES Both of you are experiments… prototypes. The final
product is almost ready. Weapon Eleven. Logan’s face darkens as the
extent of his betrayal becomes clear to him.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Creed works for Stryker. Hines nods. I
CONTTNi]RM</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LOGAN Be ordered it. He ordered Creed to
kill her. Hines can see Logan’s mounting fury. She holds up her
hands.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: I don’t know about anyone getting killed. I’m
just a scientist. I work in a lab sixteen hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Just following orders, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: He was your commanding officer for years. How
many people did you kill on his orders? Logan stares at her for a long
count. she stares back, terrified but resolute.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: All this time I been hunting Creed, and he’s
just a puppet. It’s Stryker pulling the strings. He stubs out his cigar
on the breakfast table. LOGAN You ready to stop following orders?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: The Eleven will be ready within 24
hours.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Sir… Lieutenant Hines hasn’t reported to
base today.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Hines?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stryker considers the information for a
moment and nods. STRYKER All right, thank you, Doctor. What’s this?
Cornelius sets the case on the table and opens it. Six gleaming,
armor-piercing bullets rest in green felt niches.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We saved the leftover adamantium from the
Weapon X procedure. Stryker plucks one of the bullets from its niche and
rolls it between his fingers, examining it with a practiced eye.
CORNELIUS Each one’s got a high-explosive core. Two in the head and
Logan’s brain will have to regenerate from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: They won’t kill him?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: According to the computer models we ran,
there’s a 30 percent chance his healing factor will reconstitute the
gray matter. But those synaptic bridges that form our memories? Gone. If
he survives, his brain will come back fresh.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: A blank slate… easy to train. Stryker
fondles the shining bullet lovingly. STRYKER She’s a pretty little
thing.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: She ought to be. That’s the world’s most
expensive bullet. Stryker pulls a revolver from his shoulder holster,
dumps the standard rounds, and begins loading the adamantium
bullets.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CORNELIUS There’s another way, a more
reliable way, to break down his memory.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Mm?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Only problem is, the procedure can only
be done here at Alkali Lake. Stryker swings the chamber shut and
holsters his gun.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Oh, he’s coming back, Doctor. We have what
he’s looking for.</p>
<p><strong>young sentry</strong>: Morning, Lieutenant. Hines smiles
brightly, trying to hide her nervousness.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Good morning! The sentry looks into the car’s
cabin. The passenger seat is empty. The back seat is empty.</p>
<p><strong>young sentry</strong>: Could you pop the trunk for me?</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: The trunk?</p>
<p><strong>young sentry</strong>: Yes, ma’am. It’s all standard
procedure but Hines is close to panicking. She opens the glove
compartment and hits the trunk release. The sentry inspects the trunk…
nothing but a coil of rope and a roll of electrical tape. He slams the
trunk door. YOUNG SENTRY You have a good day.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He signals to a second SENTRY standing
inside the guard house, who hits a button. The steel gate rolls open and
Hines drives into the compound.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: It’s safe. Logan crawls out from the
underbody, where he had been clinging. He dusts himself off.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Were you aiming for every speed bump in the
state?</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Sorry about that. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We find a uniform that fits. A well-built
SERGEANT walks toward his vehicle, paging through requisition papers on
a clipboard. LOGAN That ought to work.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: You have some blood on your shirt. Logan sees
the drops of blood and tries to blot them out.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I barely hit the guy. They don’t notice as a
small security camera near the entrance pivots, its black eye watching
the intruders.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hines, very nervous, tries to keep her
composure. Logan puts a hand on her shoulder– partly to steady her
nerves, partly to keep pushing her forward. LOGAN Time to visit the
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>young scientist</strong>: Lieutenant.</p>
<p>****: Murphy. Hines waits till Murphy passes. She stops in front of a
locked door and allows a laser scanner to read her retina. The door
slides open. Logan looks through the open doorway, his nostrils flaring.
He looks primed for homicide.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I can smell him. He walks through the door.
Hines checks to see if the coast is clear.and follows him. Neither
notices the security camera mounted on the ceiling, swiveling to track
their movement.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The sheer scale of the place is
staggering. Three times the size of the Super Dome, with walls of rough
granite, the cavern is loud with the constant thrum of ventilation and
high-powered machinery. Heavy steel pillars support the ceiling of the
cavern. Ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor,
arrayed in a grid, each tank slightly larger than a coffin. TECHNICIANS
walk in between the tanks, checking gauges, writing notes in clipboards.
More technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the cavern,
overlooking the Eleven, entering information into the computers that
monitor the sleeping army. Logan is awed by the sight. Hines has
descended the staircase ahead of him. He follows after her.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Welcome to Weapon Eleven.</p>
<p>****: I thought it was just gonna be one guy. This is…</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Ten thousand. They reach the cavern floor and
walk amongst the Eleven. HINES Stryker says mutants and humans will
fight a war soon. This is his army. The camera glides over the isolation
tanks as Hines continues to speak. We catch glimpses of the ELEVEN
inside, comatose soldiers with needles and wires protruding from their
skin, exactly like Logan during the Weapon X procedure. The men all look
identical and they all look oddly familiar. HINES They incorporate the
most successful features of the previous Weapons. Enhanced skeletons,
heightened senses, healing factor– I</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan stops beside one tank and looks at
the man inside, who floats in his chemical sleep. His eyes widen when he
realizes what he’s looking at.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s Creed… He looks inside another tank.
Same cruel face, same powerful body. Only their shaved heads distinguish
them from Victor Creed. LOGAN They’re all Creed.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Stryker’s most successful mutant hunter. They
cloned him years ago.</p>
<p>****: The Colonel’s been planning this for a long time. _ Logan walks
through the midst of this vast, sleeping army, surrounded by ten
thousand replicas of his worst enemy.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: They get into the world, it’s genocide.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: I think that’s the general idea. Logan stops
in mid–stride, head raised in the manner of a hunting dog who has just
caught wind of his prey. HINES What’s the matter? Logan moves, walking
quickly, nearly knocking over a technician entering data into one of the
stasis pods.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Hey… Hines hurries after Logan, smiling
apologetically at the annoyed technician.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Where you going? Logan never turns. f
rONTTNUT n %</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Don’t follow me. Hines stops, standing alone
in the middle of the Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Hello, old friend. We’ve been waiting for
you. Logan walks toward the desk, slowly now, a man in a nightmare he
can’t wake from. STRYKER Did you really think we just let you walk away
three years ago? You’re a dangerous man, my friend. We like to keep an
eye on dangerous men. When Logan reaches the young woman he puts his
hand on her shoulder. Kayla Silverfox turns and stares up at him, tears
streaming down her face.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. An aluminum baseball
bat whirs through the air, smashing the back of Logan’s head. Logan
falls to the floor, unconscious. Victor Creed stands above him, staring
at the flattened barrel of the baseball bat. 1</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Man’s got a hard head.</p>
<p>****: Let’s go. He’ll only be out for a couple minutes. Creed tosses
aside the bat and lifts Logan onto his shoulders as easily as a normal
man would lift a child of six. He carries Logan out of the room, winking
at Kayla.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: She’s real, old friend. Your eyes are
telling you. Your ears. Your nose. Logan ignores Stryker, staring at the
love of his life.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: I asked you nicely to join the program. And
you were so stubborn. But I knew if nothing else could motivate you,
revenge would. Stryker smiles at Kayla, a proud professor beaming at his
student. STRYKER Tell him. Tell him about the day you died. Kayla, head
bowed, is silent for a long count. When she speaks her voice is a
strange monotone, devoid of feeling.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: They gave me a syringe full of
hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Reduces the heartbeat to almost zero.
Breathing virtually stops. Makes you flatline for six minutes. Kayla
hops down from the truck. She holds out the IV bag to Victor, who
casually pierces it with his claw. KAYLA I’d been drawing my own blood
every night for the past week. I had four liters ready that morning.
Kayla smears. her own blood on her body and empties the rest of the bag
on the pavement. She lies down in the puddle in a fetal position, her
breathing already beginning to slow.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Why? I</p>
<p><strong>kayla -</strong>: Same as Victor. Stryker gave me a I choice:
spend the rest of my life in prison or come work for him.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Prison… Kayla finally raises her head-and
looks directly at Logan.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Shot my Daddy when I was eighteen. Big
mistake. Should have shot him when I was seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You told me he died of a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Maybe he had a heart attack after I shot him.
Sat there and watched him bleed. After what that man did to me, I wish
he died slower. Logan stares at her for a long time. KAYLA That sweet
little girl you lived with in the cabin? That was all make-believe.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You loved me. I know you loved me. Kayla
blinks and looks away.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: I’m a good actress.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No one’s that good.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Everybody’s a sucker for something.
Figuring out what it is, that’s the trick. For you, it’s a woman’s love.
An easy weakness to forgive. But still a weakness. Stryker signals to
Cornelius. The doctor and his assistant attach a nasty-looking copper
halo to Logan’s skull. The halo is wired to the electric chair. Logan
never takes his eyes off Silverfox. STRYKER Don’t be angry at her. She
was just serving her country, keeping the mutant menace in check. She
and victor have been a real credit to their race. It takes Logan a
moment to understand this comment.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re a mutant?</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: My Daddy found out when I was twelve. Said a
freak like me deserved whatever I got.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: My kind of guy.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: She’s a gifted girl. She can plant thoughts
in anyone’s mind, make them believe what she wants– as long as she stays
focused on them. He strokes her long dark hair, proud of his protege.
Kayla doesn’t seem thrilled by Stryker’s touch, but she endures it.
STRYKER A useful tool in a seduction.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Spent so much time getting you to love me, by
the time the Colonel showed up I couldn’t get you to leave me.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dr. Cornelius finishes calibrating his
machine and adjusting the halo brace.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We’re good to go.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: So, Logan… The truth is, you’re a real pain
in the ass. But we’ve invested far too much time and treasure to
terminate you. We’re starting over. Cornelius checks the digital gauges
on the machine.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: If I’ve calibrated correctly, we’ll leave
intact the hard-wired functions, walking and talking, all that good
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: You mean I don’t get to potty train
him?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: But every memory you’ve ever had will
evaporate. Just like it never happened. Logan never takes his eyes off
Kayla, his personal Judas.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Let me know when he’s clean. I have to look
in on our other guest. Stryker exits the room, followed by Victor.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That story you told me… about the guy who
goes to get flowers for the Moon. I can’t get it out of my head. Except
I had it all backwards. I thought you were the moon and I was your
Wolverine. But you’re the Trickster, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LOGAN And I’m just a schmuck who got
played. Kayla is silent for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: My mother told me that story. She takes a
deep breath and turns to go. KAYLA It doesn’t matter. You won’t remember
any of this.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You didn’t trick me into loving you.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The last two months, you weren’t playing
around in my skull. You weren’t using. your powers on me. I thought you
were dead and I loved you more than ever. Maybe it makes you feel better
to think it was all fake. But it was never fake for me. Kayla lowers her
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You don’t know where I come from. You don’t
know what it was like.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I know exactly what is was like. I come from
there too.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: I didn’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Course you did. You still do. Kayla stares
down at Logan. The tenderness returns to her face. She could free him
right now if she wanted. The moment passes and Kayla shakes her
head.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: I’m sorry. t CNTTNTTPTI’</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yeah, you keep saying that. Come on. Turn on
the juice. Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Whenever you’re ready, Miss Silverfox.
Kayla turns and walks out of the room. Cornelius and his aide follow,
shutting the door behind them. Logan takes a deep breath. He looks like
a man who is ready to forget everything.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Lieutenant. Victor and I were just
discussing how to kill you and we thought you might have some
suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: When the Turks captured a traitor, they
strapped a steel basket to the man’s stomach. Inside the basket was a
rat.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Now, even a rat can’t chew through steel.
But it can chew through a stomach. So it would. Right through the skin
and the fat and the muscle and the intestines, right on out the other
side. I</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hines looks like she might be sick very
soon. Kayla steps into the doorway. STRYKER Victor thinks the Turks were
soft, letting the rats do the dirty work. He’s looking forward to
spending your last night with you.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Please, Colonel– Stryker pats Hines on the
cheek and nods to Victor.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Enjoy yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: Please don’t do this… Please! Victor drags
the screaming Hines off of her cot. Kayla watches with growing unease
but Stryker smiles and- waves goodbye as he turns the key that shuts the
cell door.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That all you got?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: This could take a while. Raise the
amperage by forty percent.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You’re going to let Victor kill that woman.
Stryker and Collins ignore her. KAYLA When you got me out of prison, you
told me we were going to help people. Stryker continues to sign papers,
never looking up.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: We are. We’re saving humanity.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: From the mutants? The phone rings. Stryker
answers it.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p>****: Good. I’m coming down. The Eleven is ready. He stands and heads
for the door. Collins follows. In the doorway, Stryker stops and fixes
his cold blue gaze on Kayla. STRYKER Don’t worry, my sweet. You’re one
of the good ones. I’ll protect you. He and Collins exit the room,
leaving Kayla alone with her misery.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Is he clean yet? Cornelius and the assistant
face front again..</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: He’s stronger than I thought. We could be
here all night.. Kayla watches Logan in his agony. A glimmer of remorse
passes over her face.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: He was good to me. Cornelius, fiddling with
the amperage dial, curls his lips in a sardonic smile.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: You have a funny way of showing your
gratitude. Logan thrashes in his chair. Kayla chews her lip. For a long
count she watches Logan suffer.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You should turn it off now. Cornelius turns
and stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I should what?</p>
<p>****: Oh. I guess that’s… I guess that’s a good idea. He turns off
the electricity. 1coNTTN IRD 1</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You two have always hated each other. You
should fight. The assistant blinks and begins to scowl, turning toward
Cornelius just in time to get punched in the mouth. The two men brawl on
the floor with the lack of skill you’d expect from two scientists.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Hey. Wake up. Logan opens his eyes. He is
clearly disoriented, as if waking from a long coma. He stares up at
Kayla. KAYLA Are you okay? Logan stares at her, groggy and confused.
KAYLA Do you understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p>****: Do you remember me? In one blinding motion, Logan snatches
Kayla by the throat and roughly pulls her to him. She does not
resist.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I would have done anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Do you hear me? Anything. 1</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Please… Creed’s killing your friend.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: I’ve always had a thing for human
chicks. You’re all so soft and helpless.</p>
<p><strong>hines</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Maybe it’s time I did a little surgery
on you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: The woman said no. Creed turns his head and
sees Logan and Kayla standing in the doorway. He grins and tosses Hines
aside. She crashes into the wall and slides to the floor, dazed.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Starting to think you’re addicted to
pain. You keep coming back for more. Snikt !</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This is the end.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Amen to that. Kayla stands in between
them, holding up her hands.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Please! We shouldn’t be fighting each other.
Stryker’s using us.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: A little late for the Mutant Power
crap. We hunt freaks for the man. That’s why we’re free.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: What’s he gonna do with us when the other
mutants are dead? Put us in a zoo? Creed hesitates, considering the
logic of her words. A fanged smile splits his face.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Don’t try your head games on me. I’ve
gutted better telepaths than you. Creed rears back to hammer Kayla, a
blow that would separate her head from her body. Logan catches Creed’s
fist inches from Kayla’s face.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Time you quit picking on girls.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Oh, I’m happy picking on men. Creed
swings at Logan’s head, Logan ducks, and the fight begins. This is melee
so efficient that no motion is wasted. Every lunge would kill any other
adversary. Every parried blow would shatter a normal man’s arm. Kayla,
bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet. She helps up Hines and
pushes her toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Get out of here. Hines doesn’t have to be
told twice. She flees. Creed sees his plaything running out the door. He
snarls in frustration.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: You’re ruining my party. He grabs hold
of Logan and hurls him headfirst through the cell wall– a concrete
support wall.</p>
<p><strong>sentry #1</strong>: Get down! Get down!</p>
<p><strong>sentry #2</strong>: Down on your knees! Logan and Creed,
trying to punch holes in each other, ignore the sentries. Kayla, staring
down the barrels of the big guns,. holds up her hands. She concentrates,
staring into the sentries’ eyes.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: We’re here as guests of Colonel Stryker. The
sentries’ hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance.</p>
<p><strong>sentry #1</strong>: Very sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: You boys are no longer needed here. Go back
to barracks.</p>
<p><strong>sentries</strong>: You got it. See ya later. Bye! The
sentries wave cheerfully and depart. Creed and Logan are equally
skilled, but Creed’s superior size and strength begin to wear the
smaller man down. Creed slams him into the wall, opening fissures.
Holding both of Wolverine’s wrists up with one hand, Creed grabs
Wolverine’s face with his free hand.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His black claws slide toward Wolverine’s
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: How you gonna fight without eyes,
little man? Logan brings his knee up hard, smashing his adamantium-
enhanced kneecap into Creed’s groin. The big man groans. Logan spins
Creed around, jamming him against the wall. He tries to skewer Creed
with the claws of his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last
moment. Logan’s claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall. He strikes at
Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again. All six of Logan’s
claws are deep in the solid rock wall. He brings his hands. together,
the adamantium blades slicing through granite as if it were cheesecake.
Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him. He grabs
Logan in a-bear hug. A large section of the wall behind them falls out,
and, unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through the
hole, disappearing from sight. Kayla runs over and stands at the jagged
precipice, looking out onto the gargantuan Weapon XI cavern.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Stryker stands on the raised podium in the
center of the cavern, overlooking his vast, sleeping army. He cannot
believe what he’s seeing.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: I want the Eleven combat ready. 1</p>
<p><strong>lead technician</strong>: We can’t rush them,.sir. They’ve
been in stasis for–</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: I want them ready! The Lead Technician
flinches and barks orders to his subordinates, who enter commands into
their computers. The lids of ten thousand isolation tanks slide open. As
the camera roams among the Eleven, needles and hoses detach from their
bodies, releasing their metallic grip. The cloned Creeds begin to stir
in their stainless steel coffins.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Creed pounces on Logan, who is still
severely injured from the fall. Creed tears into the smaller man
mercilessly, slinging him around the cavern, gouging him with his black
talons. Creed batters Logan with a series of savage blows. Logan falls,
his healing factor overwhelmed, barely conscious. Creed plants one heavy
black boot on Logan’s face and presses down hard. He leers at his
defeated foe.</p>
<p><strong>victor creed</strong>: Your pal Wraith pissed all over my
boots when I crushed his spine. Smell like fear, don’t they? Something
changes within Logan, a fury so overwhelming it cannot be contained, a
rage so vast it could only be called berserker. .Logan rolls toward his
tormentor, sweeping his claws straight through Creed’s ankle, severing
the foot. Creed screams and falls to his knees. Logan stands, grabbing a
handful of Creed’s dirty blonde hair.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This is for the ones who couldn’t fight
back.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The adamantium blades are a silver blur
in the overhead light.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Stryker, standing on the podium, sees his
chief henchman’s head tumble from his shoulders. He grits his teeth and
surveys his army. Ten thousand enhanced warriors begin to step out of
their steel coffins, baring their fangs, eyeing their surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: Activate the PA system. The Lead
Technicians flips a switch. Stryker speaks into a microphone; his voice
booms from speakers mounted on the pillars throughout the cavern.
STRYKER Soldiers! The Eleven snap to attention with machined
synchronicity, all ten thousand facing Stryker.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Logan, bloodied but healing, stares down at
his fallen enemy.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Logan! Kayla runs down one of the steel
staircases that clings to the cavern wall like fire escapes. KAYLA If we
get closer to Stryker, I can work my magic. Logan stares at Stryker, his
true enemy, the.man who destroyed his life. Ten thousand clones.
encircle Stryker, who stands on the raised podium in the cavern’s
center.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I don’t want him hypnotized. I want him dead.
Never taking his eyes off his enemy, Logan advances.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 1.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stryker sees Logan walking toward him,
toward the hordes of clones. Stryker shakes his head and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>stryker</strong>: The man’s committing suicide. He leans into
the microphone. The Eleven listen to their commander’s voice, amplified
by hundreds of speakers STRYKER No army that ever marched could stand
against you! You will never abandon your mission, and your mission is
simple! Kill the mutants! Kill them wherever you find them! Stryker
points at Logan. STRYKER</p>
<p><strong>this is your first enemy!</strong>: Ten thousand cloned
murderers turn on Logan, soulless black eyes focusing on their target.
Logan stops his march beside one of the massive steel pillars. that
supports the cavern ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Bringin’ down the house. He sweeps his claws
clean through the pillar, at an angle. The uppermost section shears off
and drills into the floor with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the
concrete for thirty feet around the impact site. Stryker realizes what
Logan is doing.</p>
<p><strong>attack! attack!</strong>: The Eleven charge. From above we
can see the full-scale of the onslaught, wave upon wave of cloned
murderers closing in.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Logan runs to the next pillar and slices
through it. Creaks and groans sound overhead, as the tremendous weight
above exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports. Most of
the ten thousand can’t get close to Logan, but they all want in on the
first kill. Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a
circle of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood of
the Eleven. He reaches a third pillar and chops through it. Kayla eyes
the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit. STRYKER</p>
<p><strong>stop him, you idiots! stop him!</strong>: Even Logan can’t
hold back the tide for long. Talons rake his face, his arms, his chest.
But still he battles, slicing through a fourth pillar, a fifth.
Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling. Dust and rocks fall onto the
cavern floor as the fissures widen. Logan sees that the cavern’s
collapse is imminent. He can no longer hold off the Eleven’s assault. An
instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using his claws to
scale one of the still-standing steel pillars with the grace and speed
of a leopard climbing a tree. One of the clones follows, using his black
talons in the same fashion, grabbing at Logan’s feet. When Logan is
forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing clones, he severs the
pillar below his feet. The clone chasing him can climb no farther, can
do nothing but roar and hiss at his escaping prey. Logan swings himself
onto the steel staircase, where Kayla waits beside the open door. He
races up the stairs. Stryker sees his dream in ruins. He runs for the
nearest exit. Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety,
when the cavern ceiling gives out. Thousands of tons of stone and steel
come crashing down. Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant
before she would be crushed.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: One of them could have survived. Logan
glances at her. KAYLA The clones. They’ve got your healing factor. Logan
looks back at the devastation.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Unless someone comes along who can move a few
million tons of steel, they ain’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Almost looks peaceful from here.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: There’s something I want you to know. He
looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: KAYLA Maybe nothing I say matters
anymore. But I’m going to say it anyway. I… A blossom of blood opens up
on her chest. She stares down at it in wonder before sinking to her
knees. Logan turns and sees Stryker walking toward them. KAYLA No…
Stryker fires again. The adamantium bullet rips through Logan’s forehead
with an unholy sound. Logan falls to the ground. Stryker stands above
him and fires another bullet into Logan’s head. Stryker turns the gun on
Kayla. KAYLA You don’t need to waste another bullet. I’m already dead.
Stryker blinks and hesitates. Kayla coughs, her strength beginning to
fade. KAYLA Maybe you should turn that gun on yourself, Colonel. Stryker
nods, pointing the gun at his own head. KAYLA It would be good for the
mutants if I made you pull the trigger..</p>
<p>****: Why do you hate us so much? Stryker’s finger trembles on the
trigger. KAYLA Is it because your son is one of us? For the first time,
perhaps, we see something human in the cold blue of Stryker’s eyes.
KAYLA Enough killing, Colonel. Throw your gun in the lake. r 1</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stryker does as he’s told. The revolver
sinks into the water. KAYLA Leave us. Keep walking till your feet start
to bleed. Stryker turns and walks away. Kayla crawls over to Logan. She
lifts his head onto her lap. He’s unconscious but breathing. The bullet
holes in his skin have already healed. She strokes his jaw. and smiles
sadly. One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her leg.
She takes it and looks down at the blank page. She has no pen. She
touches her chest, just above her heart, wetting her finger with her
blood. She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it, folds
it once and places it in Logan’s hand. She kisses his lips and rests his
head gently on the ground. Fighting the pain, a dying woman, Kayla
manages to stand. KAYLA If you ever remember what I did to you, try to
forgive me. I was a fool. And you were right… I always loved you. She
turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back, never hesitating as
the waters rise above her knees, above her waist, above her shoulders,
above her head.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He takes a deep breath of cold air and
walks west, toward the falling sun. He doesn’t know who he is. He
doesn’t know where he’s going. But the wind blows through his hair, the
last of the sunlight feels good on his skin. He is a free man. He walks
toward his destiny..</p>
