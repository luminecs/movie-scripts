<p><strong>voice v/o</strong>: Everything you face in life. Everything
you come up against..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Everything that stands in your way.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ..your foes, your fears, your terrors….your
darkest nights.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ..are all sent to ask you the same question.
The only question..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 2.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Jessica McDowell. Cognis Chemicals. I hope
I’m not late.</p>
<p><strong>chanel suit</strong>: When do you leave Kuala Lumpur,
Ms. Macdowall?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I fly to Taiwan Tuesday then back to
Dusseldorf. I really only need five minutes of his time..</p>
<p><strong>chanel suit</strong>: I hope we are lucky. He is very busy
man.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr Tabir very busy this morning.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Oh I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Seeing’s we’re waiting..</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: ..why don’t you practice your little pitch on
me?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Actually. If it’s all the same-</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: I know all my uncle’s business. He trusts me.
Begin.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Well. I’m sure you’re aware Mr.. You’re
aware that recently your subsidiary, Kopa Oleochemicals developed an
organic, ester based lubricant derived from Kernel oil, that makes
offshore drilling significantly more environmental. My company, Cognis
CMBH wants-</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: You American?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Canadian. Actually. From Toronto.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: You a Maple Leafs fan?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Right. Uh. No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: You must be the only person from Toronto’s
not a hockey fan.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Oh I’m a fan. Dad’s from Vancouver, so I’m
a Canuck. Between us, the Maple Leaves suck. They should never have
signed Mark Bell. Guy’s a liability on an off the ice. So who’s your
team?</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: I don’t like hockey.</p>
<p><strong>chanel suit</strong>: Unfortunately Mr Tabir has no window
this morning. But tonight he extends invitation to private reception at
his residence.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Is that ok? I really don’t wish to
intrude.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: Come to the party.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Mr. Tabir? Jessica McDowall, Cognis GMBH.
Thank you for allowing me to come to your beautiful Home.</p>
<p><strong>tabir</strong>: How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Mr Tabir I wonder if you had time to glance
at our proposal which would allow Kopa to access to Cognis’ current
Petrochemical Service Partners. Essentially its-</p>
<p><strong>tabir</strong>: Please excuse me, I have to attend to
something.. My assistant here will make you comfortable..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hi. I was waiting for Mr. Tabir.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: My uncle had to leave. He asked me to drive
you to his tennis club. You can have your meeting there..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Why are we stopping?</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: Ms. Macdowall, my uncle believes that trust
is something you earn. And he doesn’t trust anyone until he knows them
very, very well..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: But he trusts you, Hafiz..</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Your car was swept an hour ago. Do not get
out. If you get out of this car I can’t protect you.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz stops dead. looks in the rearview</strong>: A black
car, 50 yards behind. He grabs her arm.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Let go of my arm Hafiz. NOW.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz valerie</strong>: Who the fuck are you? NOW!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Listen carefully. Your uncle is in business
with Abu Domar Khan-</p>
<p><strong>hafiz valerie</strong>: with shipping, money</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Khan has made contact with a terror
organisation via an aid agency in Pakistan. They are seeking materials
to build a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Your brother is in Kalutara jail in Colombo
facing execution for trafficking. We can help him.</p>
<p><strong>hafiz valerie</strong>: Bullshit. You can’t help him. We can
help him. Hafiz.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You have to think straight here Hafiz.
Because I promise you one thing… Right now, you have no idea what we can
and cannot do.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We need information about your uncle.
Contacts. Shipments. If you help us, we help you. If you don’t, your
brother dies and tomorrow you’re sitting next to your uncle in a cell in
Thailand and it won’t be me asking the questions.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You will get a call at 8am. You’ll be asked
if you need a cleaner. You want her to come three mornings per week. Do
you understand? I said DO</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: So after like six hours, he finally manages to
stand up on the snowboard, and the instructor lets go of him and he just
plummets.. I swear to god, he can’t turn, slow down, for like four
hundred yards.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And yet I’m incredible in bed.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So what do you do Valerie?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I work in Venture Capital. Brewster
Jennings, here in Georgetown.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Cool. So like net startups..?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Right. Retail and consumer.. Basically we
create pooled investment vehicles..</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sounds high risk..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I guess. But you know..high risk, high
return. Pretty boring actually. So what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>joe diana</strong>: They’re out of Corona. I got Me and Steve
won’t fly on the a Rolling Rock. same plane. We won’t even get</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We got the same train to your mom’s.</p>
<p><strong>lisa jeff</strong>: It only takes one to fly a Disneyland. A
sarin attack on plane into a nuclear power Disneyland. station-</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Whatever they’re telling us we’re totally
vulnerable. I mean who’s protecting us.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s real scary.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Joe. Would you risk taking your kids to
Disneyland right now?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Absolutely not. Far from being a playground of
the imagination, Disneyland is actually a giant clearing house for
crappy merchandise. And Space Mountain is a major disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe thinks Disneyland is Vegas for
kids.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Vegas. A dirty bomb in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: OK. You get on a plane, there’s two guys with
turbans, seats A1 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They look nervous. They’re sweating, saying
prayers..</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ye Gods..</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Steve you have a two year old. You’re off that
plane. You’re calling the cops. I think if we’re honest we all are. Joe.
Two guys. On a plane. Turbans. Praying. Sweating. What’s the call?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well Jeff..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Every time. Every time we go out.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: He started it-</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: He’s drunk Joe. Everybody’s had a hard day.
They’re just trying to let off steam-</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: By invoking quasi-racist connundra? The guy’s a
parent.</p>
<p><strong>joe valerie</strong>: Is he telling his four year It’s
Diana’s birthday. Jeff’s old to fear all men in her best friend.
turbans?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So you can’t call him a racist pussy.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: If not sitting there while someone spouts
obnoxious crap makes you an asshole. Then I’m an asshole. And you knew
that when you married me. By the way. How was your trip?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hi. Forgive me. I was staring. It’s just I’m
sure we’ve met before.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So who am I?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Valerie Plame.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Joe. Joe Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Former Ambassador to Gabon. Ambassador in
Iraq during the Gulf War. Married twice.. Has a reputation for
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’ve been misinformed. I was only acting
Ambassador in Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So what do you do, Ms. Plame?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m an energy consultant for a firm in
Brussels.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And do you enjoy your work?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Val. Where’s the babysitter?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Didn’t I say? She can’t get here til after
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: OK. I’ll work from home this morning.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Are you sure-</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Relax. Me `n Spongebob are on it.</p>
<p><strong>joe valerie</strong>: Break it up. Trevor don’t hit We’re
having supper with the your sister. Mitchells Tuesday. But if you</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I promise to behave.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: I promise to behave.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: See. We’re all gonna be on our best
behavior.</p>
<p><strong>cpd agent</strong>: Counter Proliferation tracks and thwarts
nuclear and WMD acquisition by rogue nations and non-state actors.</p>
<p><strong>cpd agent</strong>: We’re the fastest growing division in the
Agency, which sounds cool but means you may have to share a desk. Work
like hell for years you may get your own cubbyhole. And if you’re a
workaholic, they make you boss, and you get-</p>
<p><strong>cpd agent</strong>: Bad time?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hafiz hired a cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Gotta go. Kuala Lumpur just went live.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What time did he call this in?</p>
<p><strong>cpd agent</strong>: 11 hundred hours PST.</p>
<p><strong>cpd agent v/o</strong>: The asset passed the intel to the
cleaner at approximately eight fifteen local time, this morning.</p>
<p><strong>cpd agent</strong>: She made the drop fifty minutes later…
just outside Ko Yonh Subway station..</p>
<p><strong>cpd agent</strong>: ..a field team picked it up and D and D’d
it at the safe house..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We have a shipment. A holding company in
Pakistan asks Tabir to purchase 200 un-identified units, trackable by
part numbers, from..</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Teludyne Electronics of Lowell
Massachusetts..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: The shipment is delivered to Goza Tech in
Secaucus, New Jersey…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: There it’s bundled in with a second
shipment of legitimate electronic parts, and documentation attached that
masks its point of origin.</p>
<p><strong>valerie v/o</strong>: Its then dispatched as medical
electronics en route to a company in Johannesburg South Africa. First it
spends the night at a bonded customs warehouse in the Port of Jersey.
That’s the intercept.</p>
<p><strong>superintendent</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sir, we’re from U.S customs. Can I take a
moment of your time?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>dr forster</strong>: A spark gap is a high energy
voltage-controlled switching device.</p>
<p><strong>dr forster</strong>: To detonate a nuclear bomb you need to
be able to switch high voltage, high current electrical circuits at very
high speeds to the nearest hundredth of a nanosecond.</p>
<p><strong>dr forster</strong>: The extremely short rise times are
achieved by discharging a low- induct, high-voltage capacitor through
the spark gap into the bridge wire inside the warhead. The ballpark is 5
kilovolt and 1 mf for the capacitor, with a peak current between 500 and
1000 amperes…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Does it have other uses?</p>
<p><strong>dr forster</strong>: High speed photography, industrial
photo-chemistry. Zapping kidney stones.Is someone out there building the
fire train for a nuclear device component by component? You’re talking
one helluva complicated process. This guy is just one tiny piece in the
jigsaw.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: This is a list of other components exported
through the same network over the last 3 years. Tilt tables. timing
equipment. High speed monitioring devices.</p>
<p><strong>dr forster</strong>: Quartz rate sensors. Calibration units…
It’s not kidney stones. Thank god you stopped this.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m not stopping it.</p>
<p><strong>dr forster</strong>: I don’t understand..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We keep the transaction live. Trace it all
the way to the end user.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: The shipment arrives in Joburg on the 21st.
It’s put in an unmarked container and shipped to the free trade zone in
Dubai. Our asset meets there with the buyer on the 23rd.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Dr Forster and his team at Los Alamos have
altered the impedence timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a
nanosecond. Basically, they won’t know it doesn’t work til it doesn’t
work.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Can we put a wire on the asset?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Too dangerous. This network has avoided
detection for years. Expect meticulous operational security and counter
surveillance. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>deputy cpd</strong>: Val. The chief wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Val, seventh floor have issued a directive for
a Joint Task Force on Iraq. We want you to head it up.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Yes Sir.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You can pick your team. This is top priority.
Down the line D.F.U.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What about the Dubai op?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mike says you got a hunch on the buyer.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Manucher Vaziri. Syrian National. Based out
of Karachi. On a wire picked up in Cairo he talks about componentry from
a known source in Pakistan he’s moving to an unnamed Gulf state..</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Iraq?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Vaziri’s devoutly Shia. Iraq’s controlled
by the Sunni. Saddam’s Sunni. There’s no way this is Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They’re all good Muslims right?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: And Martin Luther King and the KKK are both
Christian.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Great job. From Monday, I need you both eyes
on Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>d.f.u?</strong>: 19.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Don’t fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>president v/o</strong>: States like these, and their
terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the
peace of the world…</p>
<p><strong>president v/o</strong>: They could provide these arms to
terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred..</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: They could attack our allies or attempt
to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of
indifference would be catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey hey hey. Everybody OK? Let’s take a look at
you. Four arms. Four legs. No broken bones.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hey kids! Joe I’m sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s fine. Look guys. Heather’s here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How do you think she got the job?</p>
<p><strong>analyst 1</strong>: Memo comes out saying we got two percent
women in executive roles. It’s quotas by another name. There’s ten guys
I could name could do the job better..</p>
<p><strong>analyst 2</strong>: I wonder who’s she’s fucking.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t you have a home to go to?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 21.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: DIA released the report Tuesday. WINPAC aren’t
buying and State kicked it back, but it’s making waves in the Vice
President’s Office. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: He’s qualified. He’s been there hundreds of
times. Knows the arena inside out.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You don’t look overjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: He’s been working hard to build his
business. Then there’s the twins. Money’s kinda tight right now.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’re at full stretch here. You know that
better than anyone. He’s helped us before. Could you ask him to come
in?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You want to go out for breakfast. Or stay
here?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I want to live with you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: There’s something I have to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Is your name really Valerie?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Nice place you got here. Cosy.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I need to get you cleared.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You work in the basement?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Actually. I work in Georgetown for Brewster
Jennings. We’re a small firm of Venture Capitalists.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That must be interesting work.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It pays the rent.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: This is Joe Wilson. Joe, this is Mike, the
Deputy Chief of CPD. I’ll leave you guys to it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Mr Wilson, what can you tell us about
Yellowcake?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I believe it’s a concentrate obtained from
uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs. But
I’m not a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What about Niger?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The UN Human Development Index ranks Niger the
number one Least Liveable country in the world. I started my Foreign
Service there. As Ambassador to Gabon, I travelled back many times. Then
as director of Africa policy for the NSC under President Clinton, I
frequently visited, often met with Prime Minister Mayaki. I know the
former foreign minister. I know the Minister of Mines.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: The Office of the Vice President has received
a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of
Niger and Iraq for the purchase of five hundred tons of Yellowcake
Uranium ore..</p>
<p>****: 24.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: No Sir, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: This is a request from the Vice President. Can
you help us?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Bien revenue a Niger M. Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Par la grace D’Allah. Comment allez vous, M.
Bonzala ?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Last time we met I was Minister, you
Ambassador. Now, thanks to Allah, we are free men. You’re growing a
beard, no?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So it would seem.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: So tell me. How can Niger help its old
friend, America?</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: “In summer 2001 Iraq sought to purchase
60,000 high alloy 7075-T4 aluminum tubes manufactured in China. The high
spec of these tubes led us to conclude they were intended for the
enrichment of uranium. In August 2001 J. Turner..” That’s me.. “flew to
Vienna, to meet with IAEA scientists. Mr. Turner produced this report,
aspects of which represents the CIA’s present position.” I’m happy to
take questions.</p>
<p><strong>analyst</strong>: The INR concluded late last year that these
tubes were probably for artillery use, and the DOE agreed they exactly
matched those used by Iraq for artillery rockets.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where are the tubes?</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: WINPAC has them. We’ve examined them. This
is my point. None of you guys has even seen the tubes.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’ve seen them.</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: And when was that?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: When I seized them last year in Jordan.
When I headed the covert team that intercepted them, bought back samples
and delivered them to you guys at WINPAC.</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: So I take it you’re not a nuclear expert.
These tubes are an EXACT match for those developed by German scientist
Gernot Zippe in the 50s.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You’re right. I’m no nuclear expert. But
Dr. Houston Wood, at Virginia U atomic facility is. He also knows Dr
Zippe, who’s 89 and lives in Austria, and he told him that the wall
thickness of the Iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of
his design.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And the tubes are twice as long as Zippe’s
design. In fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium
tubes is that they’re made of aluminium.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: A metal that hasn’t been used in gas
centrifuges since 1952.</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: I went to Vienna. Canada. I’ve worked on
this for months. They’re centrifuges. Fact.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So basically, they’re your tubes and if we
don’t let you win you’re going home.</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: That’s pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe. No one is saying you’re wrong here.
But if you’re right, it’s huge. So we ask the question. Right? We have
to ask the question.</p>
<p><strong>joe v/o</strong>: Niger has two Uranium mines in the Sahara
desert. One’s flooded. The other’s run by COGEMA, a French subsidiary,
jointly controlled by the Japanese and Germans.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: 500 tons of Yellowcake is not an off the books
size transaction, it represents a 40% production increase in the
nation’s annual output of uranium. A sale that size would leave a huge
paper trail.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Any documentation would by law have to be
signed by the Prime Minister, Foreign minister, and the Minister of the
mines… But say it was an off the books deal..</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How do you hide the transportation of 500 tons
of anything, let alone lightly refined uranium?</p>
<p>****: 28.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The droughts of the 80s and 90s were met by
millions of dollars of U.S Aid, which continues to this day. It just
doesn’t make sense Niger would compromise this lifeline. For that
reason, and the others I’ve given, it’s my opinion that the sale
couldn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What happens next?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: They write a report. Give it to the
analysts. It’ll be re-written, then kicked upstairs where it’ll be
thrown in with whoever else’s report they got-</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You guys are hysterical. I can’t believe you’re
actually gonna send someone else all the way out there to ask exactly
the same questions.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You can’t compile Intelligence from a
single source? That’s not Intelligence. That’s an opinion.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I can save the CIA some air fare here. There
isn’t a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Say who?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Says me.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What if you’re wrong? One guy says it’s
true. It’s not true. Lots of guys say it’s true, it’s still not true.
It’s intelligence. It’s slow. Painstaking. But it works. Checks and
balances.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What am I, a check or a balance?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Probably neither. You’re a teeny tiny weeny
cog in a giant machine. But you did your job. You should feel good. They
count on that. That’s why they don’t pay you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m not feeling that 007 right now.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I can get the kids to make you a medal, if
it’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Us double oh’s are more about the gratuitous
sex.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: Mr. President, in your speeches now you
rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>president on tv</strong>: The idea of focusing on one person
indicates people don’t understand the scope of the mission. Terror is
bigger than one person. So I just don’t spend that much time on him,
Kelly, to be honest with you…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Why is the OVP here?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Mike. The Vice President’s men are
here.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: My name is I. Lewis Libby. I’m the Chief of
Staff to The Vice President. You are?</p>
<p><strong>analyst</strong>: Dave. I’m an analyst. In non-
proliferation.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: What can you tell the Vice President about
aluminium tubes?</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: Relax Mike. The Veep’s just dotting the
i’s.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Bullshit Jim. The only time a Vice President
comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: Look. Cheney doesn’t trust us. This shit
with Dick goes back thirty years. It’ll blow over. Where are we on
Iraq?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Behind the curve Sir. Most of the intel is
outdated. We don’t have a single operative or asset in the country.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: What about geo-satellite imaging?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: With respect sir, you can’t look at this
problem from space and make a call.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: So talk to the defectors.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: The defectors are unreliable. Most are
supplied through a former asset the agency’s had on a burn notice since
`95. It’s a racket. They walk in and get paid to say whatever the
Pentagon wants to hear.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: So we’re blind.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We need sources we can rely on. We need to
get in close.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: How close?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Inside.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Jim. Val thinks she can get us inside the
weapons program.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: The warping of the extra dimension
is analogous to the warping of spacetime in the vicinity of a massive
object eg: a black hole.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: Red-shifting, generates a large
ratio of energy scales so that the natural scale at one end of the extra
dimension is much larger.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: It’s an honor to meet you at last
Dr. Harper.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: I was unable to attend your String-
Gravity seminar at MIT but I read a transcript. Truly groundbreaking
work.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: The Faculty have just moved me, so
you must excuse the mess.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: My old rooms were on the other side
of the courtyard. They were smaller but I got the morning sunlight. Will
you settle for Peppermint tea. It’s fresh.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: Tell me Dr. Harper, did you read my
latest paper on quarks. I cite your 1995 essay more than once. I would
be very intrigued to know what you made of my findings..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sir, Dr Harper is in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. She received a call yesterday requesting she stay home
for 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: I don’t understand. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m sorry for misleading you. But I’m here
to ask you the same question. Because you are not Professor Aziz.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m sorry to surprise you like this Sir.
Your name is Doctor Harif Al Fallari. You were born in Basra.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: Well. This is indeed a strange
morning. Madam, there seems to have been a mistake. My name is Said
Uhmah Aziz. I am a theoretical physicist. I model space. I’ve never been
to Basra. I’m a teacher. I’d like to be of assistance. But I’m afraid I
can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So you’re not Doctor Fallari.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: Madam. I’ve never even heard of this
man.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You were not lead engineer at the Osirak
nuclear installation outside Tikrit. You were never captured by the
Mukhbarat escaping to Syria. You didn’t spend three years in the Abu
Dhan jail.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: This is absurd.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You weren’t tortured. Broken. You didn’t
finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing.</p>
<p><strong>professor aziz</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters. They were
taken by Uday Hussein’s private guard. He never saw them again.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: That didn’t happen. They never existed.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I need names. Of your colleagues in the
weapons programmes. The lives of hundreds of thousands of your people
may depend upon it.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I know Tarif. I know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: You know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: They’re back.</p>
<p><strong>analyst 1</strong>: The Iraqis were trying to buy the tubes
off the internet. They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the
tubes. Plus the tubes are roughly twice too long. Now you could argue
that that’s to disguise them, you could saw them in half. That’s sixty
thousand tubes. I mean whew. Saddam’s gonna get the mother of all
blisters..</p>
<p><strong>analyst 2</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>analyst 1</strong>: Don’t make jokes.</p>
<p><strong>analyst 2</strong>: He thinks I don’t know how serious it
is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days, we’ve gone back over and over
it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: OK. I’ll handle this.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And so apart from all the scepticism
surrounding the specification, the analysis from the IAEA which I
believe is numbered in the report.. Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear
scientists are among the most boring people on the planet. They can talk
about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window. And maybe
once every ten years someone comes along and says “so, tell me about gas
centrifuges”. That’s literally the only time you should listen to these
guys. If they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge it’s
like a fish talking about water. We’ve been over this data with you now
five, six times. And… We don’t really know how you want us to play
this..</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Let me level with you here Paul. I don’t know
what these tubes are for. From everything you’re saying, there could be
something to this, but very likely not, right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: May I ask a question? When you say we don’t
really know how to play this, what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m just saying I don’t know how to say it any
other way than that-</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Except you didn’t say
<code>I' you said</code>we’. So you and the others have discussed how to
“play” these briefings. Why does the CIA feel the need to play these
briefings?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. I mean that.. Ok. I didn’t mean what I
just said.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Which part. The last part. Or other things
too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m a getting a little confused-</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: You want me to come back?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. GOD no.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: You don’t know why I’m here do you? In 1991
the United States invaded Iraq, and afterwards weapons inspectors
discovered Saddam was six months off enriching uranium to sufficiently
high specification to make a nuclear bomb. He had fissile material. And
not a single person at the CIA, from the DCI down to the janitor had the
slightest clue that such a program even existed. So now, one decade on,
are you telling me that you’re 100% sure these tubes are not intended to
create nuclear weapons?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I..Sir..OK. With intelligence, nothing’s 100
percent.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: So. What? Are you.. Ninety nine percent sure?
Ninety eight?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can’t put an exact figure. You can’t be
that precise.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: But if you had to say, could you say you’re
ninety seven percent sure? Is there a three percent chance you’ve got
this wrong? Or four? Or five? Still pretty good odds. You like those
odds Paul? You willing to put your name to that. Are you ready to make
that call?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t make the call, Sir-.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Yes you do Paul. Each time you interpret a
piece of data. Each time you choose a “maybe” over a “perhaps” you make
a call. A decision. And right now you’re making lots of little decisions
adding up to a big decision and out there’s a real world where millions
of people depend upon you being right. But what if there’s a one percent
chance you’re wrong. Can you say for sure you’ll take that chance and
state, as a fact, that this equipment is not intended for a nuclear
weapons programme?</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Do you know what one percent of the
population of this country is? It’s three million, two hundred and forty
thousand souls.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sir. We’re not machines. We.. It.. We look at
the evidence, we game it out. Not everyone agrees all the time. It’s a
process.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: It’s a process.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: And not everyone agrees.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Who doesn’t agree?</p>
<p><strong>analyst</strong>: What the fuck is Joe Turner doing next to
the DCI?</p>
<p><strong>analyst 2</strong>: Didn’t you hear? Friday the DCI took him
to the White House. He briefed the President on Aluminum tubes.</p>
<p><strong>analyst</strong>: You’re fucking kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Its a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So we’ve got a list of names. The Mukhbarat
watch the scientists night and day. Their houses are bugged. Their
friends are followed.</p>
<p><strong>tactical commander</strong>: Say we drop in a light weight
tac team outside the city.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You get through the checkpoints and
roadblocks. You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night with an
armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam? I’m going to react
unpredictably.</p>
<p><strong>tactical commander</strong>: What about forcible extraction
of two or three of the main targets?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: No. We’ve got 29 names. I want to get to
them all.</p>
<p><strong>tactical commander</strong>: How? You can’t use the
inspectors. You can’t use tac. The wall’s too high Val. What are you
going to do. Train a mouse?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hey, did I wake you up?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s three forty five..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I gotta go. I have to be at the airport in
forty five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well…how long this time? I mean… Do we need
childcare for tomorrow-</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I left a post-it by the lamp. Its all on
the post-it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Right. Its on the post-it.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I didn’t want to wake you. Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We’ve been leaving post-its for each other for
months now.. we talk via Post-It. That fridge is like a dead letter
drop. Jesus. Listen to me!. I sound like an old… Some- I don’t know
where you go. Who you meet. If you’re in some jail, or lying in some
ditch in Jordan, Beirut. And if you go missing, I can’t tell anyone
because you were never there. I’d never know what happened. I don’t know
where you go.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m going to Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’ll be home tonight. It’s on the
Post-It.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Dr. Al Haddad? Is there somewhere we can
speak?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: How long is it since you saw your
brother?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: 1989. I attended a medical convention over
there. Before that, in `83, he came here for an engineering conference.
Twice in twenty five years. We try to stay in contact. It’s
difficult.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Would you like to go back and see him?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: You want me to become a spy.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We need to ask Sa’ad some questions. Do you
think he would answer them?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: I’m a doctor. I work hard. I’m also a
mother. I have a small girl and I’m all she has.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We can help your brother. Right now he is
extremely valuable to us.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: And to Saddam. The Mukbarat watch him night
and day.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: He could come here Sawsan. He’s an expert
physicist. He’d have a job, his children, his family would be safe. You,
your daughter could see him whever you want. Sawsan. Can you help
us?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: I won’t do anything to help you. I don’t
know you. I would only do this for Sa’ad.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Then do it for Sa’ad.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: What would I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>agent 1</strong>: The pages of this notebook are fast
burning. You write on them like normal, but if you need to destroy them
in an emergency..</p>
<p><strong>agent 1</strong>: You have two of these in your luggage. Now
this is the only pen we want you to use..</p>
<p><strong>agent 2</strong>: The ink in this pen is visible for 10
seconds. Only when given the the correct chemical fixative can it be
read.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: - I am not taking any of this. If the
Mukhbarat find any of this they will do things to me you cannot imagine.
Tell me what you need to know. I will memorise it.</p>
<p><strong>agent 2</strong>: Ma’am, we have 50 very specific questions,
some extremely technical.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: You have 206 different bones in your body.
Do you want their names in english, latin or arabic?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Just remember, if anyone asks you anything,
if anyone stops you stay calm and tell the truth. You’re just visiting
your brother. Keep it simple and keep to the truth.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: Except it’s not the truth. How do you do
it?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: How do you be someone you’re not? How do you
lie to someone? To their face. How do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Mukhbarat. Watching the flight desk on this
side.</p>
<p><strong>flashback. the hotel room earlier</strong>: VALERIE sitting
on the edge of the bed with SAWSAN. The answer to her question:</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You have to know. Know why you’re lying.
And never forget the truth..</p>
<p><strong>blitzer</strong>: We read in the New York Times today a story
that says that Saddam Hussein is closer to acquiring nuclear
weapons.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: We do know that he is actively pursuing a
nuclear weapon. That there have been shipments into Iraq of high-quality
aluminum tubes that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs,
centrifuge programs..</p>
<p><strong>colin powell</strong>: And as we saw in reporting just this
morning, he is still trying to acquire some of the specialized aluminum
tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you an
enrichment capability.</p>
<p><strong>russert</strong>: Aluminium tubes?</p>
<p><strong>cheney</strong>: Specifically aluminum tubes. There’s a story
in The New York Times this morning. I want to attribute The Times. I
don’t want to talk about specific intelligence sources but it’s now
public that he has been seeking to acquire the kinds of tubes that are
necessary to build a centrifuge.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s a coordinated leak..</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Someone in the OVP leaked to the New York
Times and now they’re across the networks quoting the leak. “Smoking
gun”. “Mushroom cloud”. They’re using the same words. It’s
co-ordinated.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m coming home.</p>
<p><strong>blitzer</strong>: Is Iraq’s regime of Saddam Hussein right
now a clear and present danger to the United States?</p>
<p><strong>condoleezza</strong>: There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein’s
regime is a danger to the United States and to its allies, to our
interests. The problem here is that there will always be some
uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we
don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: OK. Number one I always open the window
and close the door..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You can still smell it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You want me to roll up a wet towel? Like a
teenager smoking in his bedroom. Maybe sandbag my study?</p>
<p><strong>valerie joe</strong>: What’s wrong with the deck? You used to
smoke like crazy</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh right. Middle of winter. It’s minus ten
degrees. The whole point-</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Put on a coat.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Valerie. Steve. Help me out. Val. The whole
point of a cigar you gotta get a little Winston Churchill vibe goin’.
Slippers. A crackling fire.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Musty books, slippers. Maybe a faithful
hound.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Exactly. You can’t be freezing your
balls off in a GOOSEDOWN alone in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Don’t think Churchill. Think Scott of the
Antarctic.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s it. I quit.</p>
<p><strong>valerie jeff</strong>: Honey Joe that’s terrific It’s about
personal choice. news. I’m so proud of you. It’s Joe’s personal choice
to</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: My father smoked cigars at the dinner
table for forty years. And look at me.</p>
<p><strong>diana steve</strong>: It was on Blitzer and Meet It came from
the Times. Judy the Press. All over the news. Miller. The New York
Times. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Can I ask a dumb question. What is an aluminum
tube?</p>
<p><strong>jeff steve</strong>: They have the tubes Saddam They’re for
centifuges. For was using to make a bomb. enriching uranium.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How? Who knows what they are?</p>
<p><strong>diana steve</strong>: Everybody knows they are. The question
is what else</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did you read about this Valerie?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I was in Europe on business last week. I
missed it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Basically Saddam bought all these tubes. And
we’ve nailed him. We got them. They’re packed with uranium.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They’re not packed with uranium.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Right. They’re for purifying it. The bomb
comes later. It’s how you boil it up it to make the big one.</p>
<p><strong>diana fred</strong>: Look out Israel. Says who? It’s a bunch
of</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Joe you know about this stuff, what do you
think they’re for. These tubes. What’s your hunch?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Well Jeff. I don’t know anything about
these tubes. I’m not qualified. But I suppose the real question here
is-</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s a pretext! 50% of Americans think Saddam
blew up the Towers-</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: He’s a threat. You can’t tell me he’s not a
threat.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He’s mad. Like Hitler. If we’d stopped Hitler
in the thirties-</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: He’s not Hitler. He’s Saddam. We put him
there. Why? It suited us. He’s our fault. Always was.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Have you met him? Fred. Have you met
Saddam? Have you looked him in the eye? Did he threaten you? Did he
threaten to kill you? You don’t know Saddam. You don’t know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>diana jeff</strong>: So. What’s for dessert?</p>
<p><strong>valerie fred</strong>: I’m sorry Fred. I thought we were
just</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What is this? Meet the Press?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Val’s made a Lemon Meringue.</p>
<p><strong>diana fred</strong>: Yes please. Try and stop me.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Mmm…That smells good. Shall I get some
bowls.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Thank Sue. Bottom cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We have a rule at home. No politics at the
table. It always ends in a squabble. I mean, nobody knows what’s going
on over there. At the end of the day, who really knows?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You’re right Sue. Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>passport control</strong>: Its her.</p>
<p><strong>mukhbarat officer</strong>: Al Haddad?</p>
<p><strong>mukhbarat officer</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 54.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: How is my little sister?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: Sa’ad! I am so happy to see you.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: I’ve a friend in security services. I’ve been
a government employee for 25 years, there has to be some advantage. You
can wait all day.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: The house looks very different.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: It’s falling down. In `93 they bombed
government buildings here. The foundations are shattered.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: Sa’ad I need to speak-</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: ..I have been meaning to repaint the
exterior..</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: ..but it is difficult to find the time when I
am so busy at work..but the gardens are still the same as when we were
children.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: The gardens yes of course, I would like to
see them.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: They can help you if you get out to the
Kurdish zone.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: I am watched Sawsan. If I drive even twenty
minutes north of Baghdad they will stop me.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: They’ve given me questions for you.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: What questions?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: How close is your program to a warhead? When
and where is the first test scheduled? How much 235- grade uranium do
you have? Identify other scientists in the program.</p>
<p>****: 56.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: They do not know?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: What Sa’ad?</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: The program was destroyed in 1991. The
Americans destroyed it, they know that. My god..what else?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: How advanced is the centrifuge facility?
Which method are you using to separate fissile isotopes?</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: This is insane. We don’t have spare parts to
keep a tank on the road. I have to work at a plant which develops
fertilizer. They know. The inspectors are back. They know this. They
must know.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Knowing these realities, America must not
ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril,
we cannot wait for the final proof – the smoking gun – that could come
in the form of a mushroom cloud..</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You need to see this..</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Mr Wilson. Jason Neal. How was your
flight?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We need Mike to see this. And Bill.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Ambassador Wilson is the last American
diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when Saddam threatened to
execute anyone sheltering foreigners, Wilson appeared at a press
conference wearing a noose around his neck, declaring, “If the choice is
to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed, I will bring my
own fucking rope.” Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several
thousand. He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the
President introduced him to the War Cabinet as an American hero.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s not quite true. It wasn’t the Oval
Office it was the Roosevelt Room.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sawsan’s brother worked with five hundred
scientists at the Safa factory. In
<code>91 it was blanket bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave. But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in</code>95,
the team just drifted apart. They’re all say the same thing Mike.
Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to
National Security?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I haven’t seen the intelligence. I’m not
qualified to comment. We have intelligence services working hard to
assess just this. But I have met Saddam. I’ve looked him in the eye, so
I can tell you what I saw. During a particularly vicious period of
bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign
minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal
supporter. He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an
enemy to live. For me, that is the mark of a monster.</p>
<p><strong>voice - sergeant at arms</strong>: Mr Speaker, the President
of the United States!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney,
Members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: Every year,
by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union.
This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that
lie ahead.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: We’d like you to have this coffee mug. And
some Pennants. For your kids. Thank you so much for coming and speaking
to us.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda
terrorist network share a common enemy – the United States of
America…</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: So you got thirty nuclear scientists
interrogated by Iraqis, inside Iraq, who are all saying the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Jim, these people took a great risk-</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: To bring us what? I could have saved us the
air-fare-</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The White House is getting</p>
<p>****: 60.</p>
<p><strong>jim pavitt</strong>: You know we can bark about this all
night. But that’s all we’re doing. Barking. You, me, all of us.. We’re
guard dogs. We can bark and bark, but at the end of the day, someone’s
gotta listen. Because it’s not our house. Even if it is on fire.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Today the gravest danger facing America
and the world is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Can I get an American please. Just a
regular American?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam
Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical
agents.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: From three Iraqi defectors we know that
Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: The International Atomic Energy Agency
confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear
weapons development program, and was working on five different methods
of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that
Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Our intelligence sources tell us that he
has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for
nuclear weapons production.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This nation fights reluctantly, because
we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come. We
seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be
defended.</p>
<p><strong>public address</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen Flight 22 to
Dulles is boarding immediately at Gate 20. We apologize for the delay
due to adverse weather conditions-</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We Americans have faith in ourselves, but
not in ourselves alone. We do not claim to know all the ways of
Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the
loving god behind all of life and all of history. May he guide us now,
and may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 62.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: What you doing? They’re watching-</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: No one’s watching. Not anymore. I think
the Secret Police have their hands full.</p>
<p><strong>scientist 2</strong>: We’re free. Free to be blown to
smithereens.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: Least no Mukbarat gets to watch it.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: It’s good to see you, my dear fellow
doctors…</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: My sister said the Americans could get us
over the border.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: And you trust them? Open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>scientist 2</strong>: And your ears. Your American friends
are calling you right now.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: It’s our only hope.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Bill. Wait up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Val, every Mobile Exploration Team is combing
the desert looking for WMD. I can’t-</p>
<p><strong>valerie bill</strong>: All I need’s a couple units We’re at
full stretch Val. to bring these men and their Listen to me.. families
into Camp Lima and on an air transport into Annandale.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say we extract these guys. Bring
<code>em home. Put</code>em on CNN. What are they going to tell us that
the White House wants to hear? “Thank you oh and by the way there was no
nuclear programme. There’s no WMD. PS you all knew that.” You want me to
go to the DCI, ask him to sign off on his own funeral?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I gave my word Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s not my problem. I got bigger
problems.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why do you do this job? The paycheck? The
holiday package. No. To make a difference. To act. To protect people.
Then one day you realize you’re not Superman. Sometimes you fail.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hold the elevator please.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What the fuck is going on Mike. It’s like,
if there was a baby on the ledge up on seventh, no-one would get up and
save it in case the White House wanted it there.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Bill’s right. This is just one snafu in a
thousand we got right now. The scientists are-</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: These scientists are the WMD. If we can’t
protect them, they’ll run to the first country who can. And they’ll put
them to work.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I never said this. If anyone asks, I deny any
knowledge. How quietly can you do this?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Beth! Who do you have in Baghdad? I need to
get an RG-17 to an asset in Mansour.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why don’t your guys to do it?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m asking you.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: I need to know my family will be safe.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: My wife, my children. They are all I care
about.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sa’ad, I know that. We will take care of
your family. But we have to move fast.</p>
<p><strong>sa’ad</strong>: How do I know I can trust you?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sa’ad. Do exactly as I say, we won’t let
you down.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: So how’s Val? Is she there? Put her on..</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: She’s fine. She’s working late.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Val’s working late. I’m working late. You
don’t see a pattern here? You know she finds me devastatingly
attractive-</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah. Well if you see her say hi. Listen Pete.
I have a question. And it’s real important.</p>
<p><strong>back to:</strong>: 67.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Is the President be referring to another
African country?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’ve seen the INR. It’s Niger. He’s referring
specifically to Yellowcake from Niger. Why?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Uh huh.. I see..I see. What exactly are you
proposing to do Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You want my advice? Do nothing. You already
did your job. You did your best. You came home. End of story.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Niger Pete. Yellowcake from Niger.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Look. I don’t have to go all the way to Africa
to know something’s fucked up here. Three months and what have we found?
No centrifuges. No yellowcake. No bio. No WMD. You think something’s up
here. Join the queue. Join the line stretches all the way from State to
the Pentagon and back.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: So why has no one’s come forward?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Why you think Joe? We went to war. Listen.
You’re a smart guy. As your friend, now. Just. Be smart here. I
mean..you have a wife and a family.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: It’s the White House Pete. It’s the
President of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yes it is Joe. Now go take a long look in the
mirror and say that again.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey. Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’s wrong Val?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Nothing. I’m just tired..</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Whats the matter..what happened?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m fine. Are the kids asleep.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah. They’re asleep.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: OK. I’m going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: Let me finish..No. Let me finish.</p>
<p><strong>bush</strong>: There are some who feel like that, the
conditions are such that they can attack us there. My answer is bring
’em on. .</p>
<p><strong>extreme close up</strong>: Joe writes:</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Retired Ambassador Joe Wilson yesterday
claimed in a piece in the New York Times that the President mispoke in
his State of the Union Address in January, concerning claims that Saddam
sought 500 tons of Yellowcake from Niger. Wilson, who was acting
Ambassador in Iraq during the first Gulf War, said-</p>
<p><strong>mr. fleischer:</strong>: Look. There’s zero, nada, nothing,
new here. The President’s statement in the State of the Union was much
broader than the Niger question.</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: Is the President’s statement
correct?</p>
<p><strong>fleischer:</strong>: Yes, I see nothing that goes broader
that would indicate that there was no basis to the President’s broader
statement. But specifically on the yellow cake, the yellow cake for
Niger, we’ve acknowledged that that information did turn out to be a
forgery.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 2</strong>: The President’s statement was
accurate?</p>
<p><strong>fleischer:</strong>: We see nothing that would dissuade us
from the President’s broader statement.</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: So you believe the British report is
true?</p>
<p><strong>mr. fleischer:</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. fleischer:</strong>: Sorry, I see what David is asking.
Let me back up on that and explain the President’s statement again..</p>
<p><strong>hadley</strong>: Linda. Clear my morning.</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: So it was wrong?</p>
<p><strong>fleischer</strong>: Let me do this, David. On your specific
question I’m going to come back to you.</p>
<p><strong>rove</strong>: What is that tit-fuckin’ homo Fleischer doing
to us? Call Mary. Call Scooter. Call Hadley. We need to get a hold of
this. NOW!</p>
<p><strong>martin libby</strong>: Fleischer ploughed the I saw.
briefing-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: -CBS know Yellowcake was pulled from
Cincinnatti ten weeks ago at the CIAs request. They also have that
Gerson wrote both speeches. Karl is on line one. He’s unhappy-</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: I want a transcript of everything across
networks, blogs and print citing Ambassador Wilson, Niger or Yellowcake.
I want Hadley to meet me in the VP’s office in five minutes. And tell
Karl I’ll be in my office straight after I’m done. I have something.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: This has become a trust issue for the
President. We can’t get behind this. We need to change the story.</p>
<p><strong>rove</strong>: Who is Joe Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Linda. You still here. It’s late..</p>
<p><strong>rove</strong>: We can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: So who can?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: The CIA’s decision to send retired diplomat
Joseph C. Wilson to Africa-</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Further down.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Wilson never worked for the CIA, but his
wife, Valerie Plame..</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “is an agency operative on weapons of mass
destruction.”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They just went ahead and did it.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Does this run overseas?</p>
<p><strong>valerie joe</strong>: The column. Novak’s column. If it’s in
the paper it’s on Is he syndicated overseas? the net. Its
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Valerie. Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>neighbour</strong>: Morning Valerie!</p>
<p><strong>director of operations</strong>: Good morning. Please..sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Good morning Sir. Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>director of operations</strong>: Working backwards, we need a
matrix of everyone you’ve come into contact with in a covert capacity
back to January 2001.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’ve already started a list Sir.</p>
<p><strong>director of operations</strong>: Good. We need to get an
idea..fast, of how much this thing bleeds.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sir, I have several live ops at crucial
stages, people in the field in critical windows of operation-</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: One thing at time. Make a list. Then come back
here. Don’t do anything else.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sir, why is Internal security here?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: To help us. To help you, and us conduct this
damage assessment.</p>
<p><strong>internal security</strong>: This way please.</p>
<p><strong>internal security</strong>: Ms Plame.</p>
<p><strong>internal security</strong>: Ms Plame.</p>
<p><strong>internal security</strong>: Ms. Plame.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Mike. We need to get a message to Baghdad.
Sa’ad and his family are being taken to the border today. I have to get
word to them.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t what you’re talking about..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Mike. They’re packed and ready. Mike you
know what this means.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sorry. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Valerie.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sit down Valerie. I’ve just been on the
seventh floor. As of this morning all CPD operations involving you have
been suspended. Effective immediately you are to have no further contact
with assets or agents in the field. Any further involvement in
operations is no longer possible.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Bill. I have eight, nine teams in the
field. We have assets in Kuala Lumpur. Dubai. Mumbai.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I need to brief my replacement in the Joint
Task Force.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The head of the JTFI’s identity is classified
for reasons of operational security.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I have a critical operation in Baghdad in a
major ongoing-</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Val. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “Two senior administration officials told me
that Wilson’s wife suggested sending him to Niger” That means a Vice
President, a chief of staff or top advisor.. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hey guys. Give mommy a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>trevor samantha</strong>: Mommy! Mommy. Trevor won’t let
me</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Well, did you say “Please”?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: I said please. It’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>trevor joe</strong>: I drew a clown and a There’s a 1982 act
states scarecrow. it’s a crime for a government Let’s see. Carries a
fine of fifty</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Wow. That is one cool scarecrow. Don’t eat
that Sam. It’s a crayon. It’s icky. Give it to mommy.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: How did it go?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s been ringing all day.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Don’t pick it up. Who’ve you spoken to?
Joe, who have you spoken to?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Hello? It’s Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: OK who wants to watch TV?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Val. Are you OK? Whats going on?</p>
<p><strong>back to:</strong>: 80.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Lisa. Yes. I read it. Listen- I’m sorry..I
can’t talk about this. I can’t..I can’t make a comment on this right
now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You can’t make “a comment”? Val. Your name is
in the paper. It says you’re a CIA agent.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I have to go. I’m sorry. I’ll call you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your mom called. And your Uncle. And Janey
called from Chicago. I wrote them down. And Andrea Mitchell called. She
says White House sources say that quote “the real story here is not the
sixteen words but Wilson and his wife”. Would I care to comment? Yeah I
fuckin’ would care to comment. She wants me on the show day after
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I don’t want you to go on TV.</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Going in thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: This is clearly designed as a shot across the
bow to those who might step forward, those unnamed analysts who said
they were pressured by the White House would think twice about having
their own families names being dragged through this particular mud.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I was sent to Niger at the request of the Vice
President. I was not sent by my wife. The issue here is not who sent me
here is whether a crime has been committed.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: You’re saying a crime was committed</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It is a crime to reveal the identity of a
covert agent working in the employ of this nations intelligence
agencies. This is now a matter for the justice department Pete.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The justice department need to establish
whether those in the Highest Office sought to destroy the career of a
public servant to punish me for speaking the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mclennan</strong>: First of all, that is not the way this
White House operates.</p>
<p>****: 82.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Will the President move aggressively to
see if such a transgression has occurred in the White House?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This is a very serious matter, our
administration takes it seriously. I’ve got all the confidence the
Justice Department will do a good, thorough job. I want there to be full
participation, because, April, I am most interested in finding out the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Valerie. Turn on MSNBC.</p>
<p><strong>msnbc valerie</strong>: A team of federal Honey, Mommy’s
trying to investigators have been listen to the TV. assembled by
Attorney General John Ashcroft as part of a probe to investigate the
alleged leaking of a covert CIA agent’s identity to the press..</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: They’ve launched an investigation.
Ashcroft just announced it. They’re saying he’s going to convene a grand
jury.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I have to go. Samantha’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: I’ll be home later. I gotta go over to
Fox. They want me to comment on the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe-</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: We have to fight this Val. If we don’t
push back.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I have another call. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe-</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Joe Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>chris matthews</strong>: Joe, its Chris Matthews. I just

<p><strong>diana</strong>: So when did you join?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: `84. Straight out of college.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Jenny said it makes a weird kind of sense.
Everyone says Valerie’s a great listener. Asks lots of questions. About
your job. About Steve or the kids.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I had no plan for this day. Right now it
feels like I’m.. Everything is smashed into a million pieces. It’s like
I’m suddenly in this-</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Every conversation. For twenty years.
Thousands of phone-calls. You lied to me on every single one. Nineteen
years. Birthdays. My wedding. You’re my best friend Val.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Diana. I know it’s hard to understand, but
it..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It becomes normal.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Normal.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I know this is strange for you. And you may
not feel like it’s, but I need you right now. Because I’m-</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: What? What are you? My ol’ pal Val? I have
photos. Hundreds and hundreds of photographs with this person. And..</p>
<p>****: 85.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hey guys. How was your day?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hello. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>phone</strong>: Your husband is a fucking communist. I hope
you die you fucking communist whore.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Mommy. Trevor won’t let me go on his
tractor.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s OK honey. Mommy’s just tired.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So the caterpillar built a cocoon and it
stayed safe inside for weeks. And when it emerged it was a beautiful
butterfly..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sawsan. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: Your name and address are all over the web.
There’s even a picture of your house..</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: Sa’ad has disappeared. His wife, his
children are missing. My uncle in Mansour. He said they were targeting
them. They were killing them..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: Sa’ad’s colleagues. Dr Habbuck was shot dead
in the street. Dr Falli was murdered in his hallway. They’re killing
them.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sawsan, listen to me-</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: I know you can’t tell me where he is. Just
tell me you have him. I beg you. Please. I don’t need to know anything.
Just tell me he’s safe.. He’s my little brother. Please. If you have
him, if he’s somewhere… Please. Please, I beg you. Do you have him. I
have to know.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We don’t have him.</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: You said he would be safe. You said we would
help. You promised-</p>
<p><strong>sawsan</strong>: I trusted you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Valerie. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Falli. Habbuck. Who else?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Valerie-</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Who else Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You were right. It’s all about the scientists.
We made a call.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: A call?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We passed your case files to liason. You know
yourself we’re not great at this stuff. Val, Mossad were already on the
same page.</p>
<p>****: 89.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You’ve.. We’re killing them. We’re killing
the scientists.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Valerie-</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You’ll drive them underground. They’ll run
straight to Iran. Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Valerie. This isn’t your problem anymore.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s not my problem. It’s not my problem.
How can you sleep when you know-</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I sleep just fine. Now Carol’s mother is here.
I’m going to have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s called counter-proliferation,
Mike.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: At the end of the day, it’s of keen
interest to me to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog- marched
out of White House in handcuffs. And trust me when I use that name, I
measure my words.</p>
<p><strong>supporter</strong>: We came all the way from Portland for
this.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your support means everything to us.
Really.</p>
<p><strong>supporter 2</strong>: You’re a true American hero.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The real heroes are in Iraq right now fighting
a war which was prosecuted on lies and falsehoods.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: My wife and I have never sought publicity. But
I know when I tell her about how much support there was here today, I
know how thrilled and humbled she’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: Thank you for coming here today. I wanted to
convey my outrage to you in person. In all my experience, nothing has
disgusted me like this business.</p>
<p>****: 91.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I get death threats every day. People
threatening to kill my husband. Hurt my children. I went to the agency
and I requested security to protect my family. It was declined. Because
quote “My circumstances fall outside budget protocols.” If this is a
knife fight, right now, Sir - we’re fighting it alone.</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: Joe Wilson versus the White House. Well, all
I can say is Good Luck. But as a friend, I feel I should tell you that
those men..</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: Those few men in that building over there,
that small white house, are the most powerful men in the history of the
world. How much of a stretch do you think it would be for them to take
on Joe Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>pavitt</strong>: Joe’s out there on his own Valerie. But I
know we can trust you. Speak to your husband.</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: The nightmare scenario of an attack on a major
city is as real, if not more real, than it was a year ago..</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Tucker Carlson said yesterday that
Wilson’s wife sent him on a boondoggle. Said I needed the work. Who
needs to work for free? Niger does have restaurants. The Opera. Reminds
me alot of Paris.</p>
<p><strong>rumsfeld on tv</strong>: We know if we do not fight the
terrorists over there in Iraq, in Afghanistan and across the world, we
will have to face them here.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Someone from Vanity Fair called. They
want to do a piece on us. Cover-story. Five thousand words. In-depth
interview. Photographs of the two of us. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What do I think? Do I want my photograph in
Vanity Fair? Is that the question?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson news</strong>: We have to keep this as high In
Baghdad today, co- profile as possible. We have ordinated car bombs
killed to keep fighting. 175 in what is being called</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Val…what’s wrong? What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: My name is everywhere, Joe. My real name.
Everywhere. All this publicity and noise and fighting talk, where is it
getting us?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Karl Rove told the Financial Times they’re
rolling the earth movers over Joe Wilson. Quote.</p>
<p>****: 93.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s the White House Joe. You seriously
think you can pick a fight with the White House and win. They’ll bury
us.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: They’ll bury us if we don’t. How loud
can you shout Val? Say we get in an argument you think you’re right, and
I think your wrong. You start making your point with all your might, and
I start shouting back, except I’m the White House, and I can a shout a
million times louder. Does that make me right? They lied Val. That’s the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: By the time they’re finished here you won’t
know what that is.</p>
<p><strong>reporter on tv</strong>: Today Special Prosecutor Patrick
Fitzgerald, in charge of the enquiry into the leaking of the identity of
a covert agent announced that he is convening a Grand Jury to
investigate the affair. Among the blizzard of subpoenas issued are ones
for the Vice President’s chief of Staff Scooter Libby, and special
advisor to the President Karl Rove. Both men are under suspicion of
having leaked the agent’s name to reporters in order to damage former
Ambassador Joseph Wilson, a vocal and combative critic of the
administration. It is believed that the President himself has been
questioned under oath by the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>rove</strong>: Scooter home?</p>
<p><strong>rove</strong>: Scooter.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rove</strong>: Findings of the Select Committee on
Intelligence. All five hundred pages and eleven pages of it.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Am I going to enjoy it?</p>
<p><strong>rove</strong>: I know someone who isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Look at the soldiers mommy. Look!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Go and play now.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: That is the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence. On page thirty six it says “the former ambassador’s wife
offered up his name” and includes a memorandum written by Valerie Plame
which says quote “my husband has good relations with both the prime
minister and the former Minister of Mines, both of whom could possibly
shed light on this sort of activity.” I’ve spent a whole year denying
just this.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe wait-</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Telling everyone who’ll listen, on TV.
In the press. My wife did not send me on a junket.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe. I didn`t send you. I didn’t have that
power.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: You sent an email. The SSCI found the
email.</p>
<p><strong>valerie joe wilson</strong>: I write hundreds of emails. Why
didn’t you tell me? At no</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I didn’t make the decision. I was asked to
write a recommendation. What am I supposed to do. Not say my husband
knows about this.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: They have this now. They will call me a
liar. It will stick. They have all the power here, what do I have?</p>
<p>****: 96.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Joe-</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: You have to defend us. Now.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: So what do you want me to do Joe? Go to the
papers like you did? Write a piece in the New York Times? You know I’d
have to submit it to the Agency, and they’ll-</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: The agency? The.. Wait.. Is this the
same Agency which won’t give you protection for your children? Is this
the same CIA that’s erased your pension? Where’s your loyalty Val? To
your husband or the CIA?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s to MY FAMILY. I put my family first.
ALWAYS. Were you putting them first when you wrote that fucking
article?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m taking different routes to and from
school. I’m looking in empty rooms..under the beds every time I come
home. A home we’re going to lose because your work has dried up and your
clients are running for cover. What has all this achieved? What changed
Joe? Who won?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Maybe you’re right. Maybe I should have
kept my mouth shut. Is that what your dad taught you Valerie? That what
Colonel Sam Plame said?</p>
<p>****: 97.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Did you send me to Niger? “His business is
struggling. He’s on the slide. I’ll throw him a bone.” Was that it Val?
You pull some strings for me? You help your old man out?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: How dare you?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Did you send me?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You think I’m lying to you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Could I tell if you were?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You fucking bastard..</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: The Senate Intelligence Committee
published information that showed Joe Wilson had lied about how he came
to be sent to Niger. He denied that his wife had any role in it
whatsoever, but a memo Plame wrote on February 12, 2002 proves
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: The Senate Intelligence Committee let
some air � a lot of air - out of Joe Wilson’s overly inflated ego when
it issued its first report on prewar intelligence. While the committee
heaped most of its criticism on the Central Intelligence Agency for
getting almost everything wrong about Iraq and weapons of mass
destruction it pointedly rebuked the former ambassador and his infamous
mission to Niger.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr Wilson, do you still maintain the Vice
President’s office sent you Niger and not your wife?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: Mr Wilson was Niger just a free holiday?
A boondoggle?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: My wife did not send me. I didn’t
receive payment. It was not a holiday. It was a fact finding mission in
the run up to a war. But the fact is no one wanted facts.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Are you against our troops Mr Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Wilson is it true you donated money to
the Kerry campaign?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: People are saying your wife does not
actually work for the CIA.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Is it true she was just a secretary at
Langley?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: No comment.</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: The question still remains, who is Valerie
Plame? Was she really simply a glorified typist?</p>
<p><strong>rogers</strong>: Well, I think it’s really all about the
money. We’re talking about a third-rate CIA agent who had a government
salary, and she had sent her husband to Niger, and he had come back and
didn’t give the report to the CIA, but he turned it over in an op-ed to
The New York Times. So she was already in the hot seat with the CIA, and
so now she’s all about the money. Plus it’s come out that she was
considered kind of a mediocre agent at best.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: When we were at the “Farm”, training to be
field officers, they picked four or five of us and told us we’d stood
out.</p>
<p><strong>back to:</strong>: 100.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We were bound, hooded and thrown in
separate cells. They beat us. Deprived us of sleep. All you had to do
was give up the name of one of the others. Just one name. For a glass of
water. A sandwich. To avoid another punch.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Another hour in a stress position.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: They push you until they find it. Til they
find the point at which you break. Because they have to know. You have
to know. And one by one, everybody broke. Except me. I never broke. I’ve
been in situations, places where I was afraid. Where if you made a
mistake, one tiny mistake, at any moment.. But I never made a mistake.
And that made me feel special. I thought: I’m Different. Bullet- proof.
You can’t break me. I don’t have a breaking point. I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: OK. Say goodbye to your father.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Hey guys.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: We’re going on a mystery tour.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Why aren’t you coming daddy.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: I’ll see you both real soon OK?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: OK guys. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>valerie’s mom</strong>: Who wants to make toffee apples?</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Me! Me!</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: Well don’t just stand there.
Come take a look.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: It’s cherry. I thought it’d
work in your dining room. I can see the great and the good of Washington
eating off this thing for years to come. Just sanding her down then she
done.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>valerie’s mom</strong>: Sam. I keep telling you. They have a
table.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: Well come here.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: How’s your wife Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: She’s fine. She’s well. She uh..</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Hi. I’ll just have a strong coffee. I’m
not very hungry.</p>
<p>****: 103.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Can I help you? Excuse me. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>right wing reporter</strong>: I’m just telling these people
that you sir are a fraud.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: OK. This is a private lunch. Please leave us
alone.</p>
<p><strong>right wing reporter</strong>: This man is a liar and a
traitor. He is in the pay of left wing hate groups, he is a democrat
stooge, and he is an anti-war zealot. He has stabbed our troops the
back.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: OK. Leave now.</p>
<p><strong>businessman 2 right wing reporter</strong>: May we get the
check? You have blood on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: OK. Leave my fucking table. Now. How dare you
talk about my wife? You don’t know her. You don’t know me. Now leave my
table. Now.</p>
<p><strong>right wing reporter</strong>: Ladies and gentleman. Joe
Wilson.</p>
<p>****: 104.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I think we should leave.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: No. Please.</p>
<p><strong>businessman 2</strong>: No really we should.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: We’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Shame on you. You call yourself a
reporter. Shame on you. You’re a self publicising hack. Fuck you. Fuck
you.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Pallisades.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: You’re him. I see you on the TV. You’re
Joe Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Yes brother. I see you on the TV.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: That’s somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: No no. I know you. My name is Joe too.
I am from Sierra Leone. Freetown. You’ve been there, right. You like
Freetown?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Joe, we both know Freetown’s a shit-
hole.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: That’s the truth. That’s the truth
right there, brother. Yes indeed. Sierra Leone is dying. The people at
the top have too much power. WAY too much power. Over there we have no
truth. Just power. People can’t see that from here. Over here it’s a
different world.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: I wouldn’t be so sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: How can you say that? Land of the Free,
brother. Home of the Brave.</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: Can we pull over. I’m going to walk.
Look keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Do you pray, Joe Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>joe wilson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: I give you this. It is my church maybe
you come. And if you open a bible, look John Chapter eight.</p>
<p>****: 106.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: How’s is he?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh you know. Getting better. Shakin’
through.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: OK. See those birds. Those
guys. Those yellow fellas. See `em..</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Yeah I see `em.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: OK. Listen. You hear that?
Ain’t that beautiful. They suddenly showed up last year. They’re
called.. What are they called? I know their name. They’re called
something. Anyway. They were here last year. And the year before. God
they’re beautiful. Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Dad, I think my marriage is over.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: Well. I know my little girl
doesn’t say anything til she absolutely has to.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: I’m the same way. And I’ve
said that too. Those exact same words. July 1972. Your mother and I were
fighting all the time. I guess she was just plain tired of moving home.
Wasn’t `til I retired after 42 years in the Air Force, I realised we
never had a home. Germany, Singapore, Australia, England. Heck I can
remember the day you were born in a freezing cold airbase outside
Anchorage Alaska. You must have been to twenty schools. Twenty different
chances to introduce yourself. Be someone new. But you turned out OK.
Responsible. A little too serious. Always looking down the road.
Worrying where life was going to drag you next. But it made you tough.
Real tough. Maybe tougher than I, or your mother, or anyone knows.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: He wants me to go on the record. Speak out.
Like that would suddenly make this all go away. We can’t even speak to
each other. I can’t see how this comes round. I just can’t see it, pop.
Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: What they did was wrong
Valerie. Plain wrong. Never forget that.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: Say through some miracle you
even get through this.. you and Joe are always gonna fight. You’re
fighters. He’s a stubborn son of a bitch too. He don’t give up easy
either.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: One day this country is gonna
look back on these years, and it’s gonna hang its head. It’s gonna weep.
Then it’s gonna stand up straight and walk on.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame</strong>: I swear to God, she’s gonna
keep at that until she licks it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. colonel sam plame.</strong>: They’re tougher than we are.
They’ll piss you off from time to time, but they’re built to last.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Mister? We’re closing. You have to
leave.</p>

the fall. He gets pardoned. The deck’s stacked. I bet this doesn’t even
get to a trial.</p>

<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I don’t care how angry you get. I don’t

Benjamin Franklin left the Constitution Hall after the last drafting

been invited to testify under oath before the Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform on the critical issue…</p>
<p><strong>real valerie footage</strong>: …of safeguarding classified
information. I’m grateful for this opportunity to set the record
straight. I served the United States loyally and to the best of my
ability as a covert operations officer for the Central Intelligence
Agency. I worked on behalf of the national security of our country, on
behalf of the people of the United States until my name and true
affiliation were exposed in the national media on July 14th, 2003, after
a leak by administration officials. Today I can tell this committee even
more.</p>
