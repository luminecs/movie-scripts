<p><strong>extreme cu</strong>: PACMAN, from the old video game, just a
yellow ball with a mouth, fills the screen in all it’s lo-res glory. The
camera tracks along as it rolls along a tight corridor, gobbling
dots.</p>
<p><strong>extreme cu</strong>: A RED GHOST follows, in hot pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>extreme cu</strong>: PACMAN gives it the slip, cuts down and
gobbles a big dot.</p>
<p><strong>extreme cu</strong>: RED GHOST transforms into BLUE GHOST,
changes direction and runs. PACMAN chases … P.. but just before he
catches up the BLUE GHOST transforms back to RED and changes direction
again. PACMAN barely escapes.</p>

<p><strong>int chelios kitchen, continuous 4</strong>: … the kitchen,
with a black marble island and hanging copper.</p>
<p><strong>chelios</strong>: Whathufuck?</p>
<p><strong>5a 5a</strong>: It’s RICKY VERONA on the SCREEN, a young,
irritatingly slick EASTERN EURO … little to no accent - fast talking,
sarcastic, a complete dick …</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: What’s shaking, douchebag? Thought I’d give
you the heads up. You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: Yeah, that’s right, you little bitch … if
you’re watching this tape it means that I somehow resisted the urge to
dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal … opting
instead to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you heard me…</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: … I fucking poisoned you in your sleep. How
sick is that?… for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last
minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there’s nothing you
can do about it…</p>
<p><strong>5a 5a</strong>: … that’s right, you’re on candid camera, try
not to embarrass yourself…</p>
<p><strong>continued: verona</strong>: the shit I gave you is some
fucking high tech sci-fi Chinese synthetic shit that even I don’t know
exactly what the fuck it is. All I know is once it binds with your blood
cells, you’re fucked, baby… and believe me, it’s done binded. By now
you’ll be feeling your joints stiffen up… hard to breath…</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: … your heartbeat is slowing down like
there’s rust in your veins… you’re like the Tin Man in the Wizard of
freaking Oz…</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: “If he only had a brain.”</p>
<p><strong>erona</strong>: Scarecrow. Whatever. You get the point.
You’re fucked. You got maybe an hour, max, tough guy … baby … sexy …</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: Hey, it’s been real. Probably should’ve
thought twice before you whacked Don Kim. Experiencing a little 20/20
hindsight? I thought so. Have a nice death…</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: … asshole.</p>

leave me a message? Unless you’re trying to sell something, because I’m
absolutely not interested. But if you’re not …</p>

service, would you like me to have him paged?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Fine, yes, please let the doctor know that
Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can’t call me back within the hour… got
that? C</p>
<p><strong>hocolate</strong>: Can you spell that for me sir?</p>

<p><strong>hev</strong>: Yeah, yeah. You wanna know what I was
doing?</p>
<p><strong>kaylo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kaylo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hev</strong>: What? What? You heard me. That son of a bitch
Ricky Verona.</p>
<p><strong>aylo</strong>: Ricky Verona …</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Who would’ve thought that little bastard had
the stones to come whack me in my own crib… it’s inconceivable… and yet,
here we are.</p>
<p><strong>kaylo</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: I’m dead and you’re simple. Now listen: you
put the word out I’m looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call
me.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: I’m going to get that little son of a bitch if
it’s the last thing I do… it may actually be the last thing I do,
understand that? Copy me on that?</p>
<p><strong>kaylo</strong>: Ricky Verona?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Find him!</p>
<p><strong>int. black sabbath clubhouse, continuous</strong>: 20 20</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Where’s Verona!!</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: It’s cool it’s cool it’s cool!</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Talk!!</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: I’m talking! What are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Don’t fuck with me!!</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: OK, nobody’s fucking with you, just calm
down …</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: O-land-o! What’s up!</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: There’s a white man with a gun in here, I
would prefer that he not cap my ass, so please refrain from any sudden
ass bullshit! Now you see that? I’m trying to help you here.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Look, I got to find Ricky Verona …</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Why would I know where … ?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: … right, I know, you don’t know where he is,
but you’re going to tell me where he is, or I’m going to BLOW YOUR
BRAINS</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV’S heartbeat,
pumping.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Can we all just get along? Can we?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Now Chevy here has something he would like
to discuss. So we are going to discuss it. In a civilized manner. Chevy?
I believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Where’s Verona.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky
Verona.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: You pulled the Anselmo job together, don’t try
to bullshit me …</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Easy … easy … now things are beginning to
clarify … you see how that works? How discussion can lead to
clarity?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Clearly you are operating under a false
pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did not “pull the Anselmo job
together.” In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact,
Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: That’s not how I heard it.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: But that’s the way it is. That’s the way it
is. So you see, I don’t know where Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew
where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass
down.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady
hand, studying ORLANDO’S eyes, evaluating.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Thank you. That’s what I’m talking about.
That resembles civility.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Shit dude, what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona,
that little bitch …</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: I understand that. You’ve made that point
abundantly clear to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Now what can I do to help you?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Look, just give me some coke, OK? You got any
coke?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: OK, now you’re insulting me.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Come on, man, I know you got coke.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: You think every brother is carrying, is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Come on, I don’t have time for this, just give
me something … I’m really dying here …</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: No. You don’t understand, I’m really fucking
dying … if I don’t … May I just have some coke, please?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: So this is medicinal use coke, that’s what
you’re telling me.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hat?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: You got something for me, or what?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Chevy … come on, man…</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: OK, that’s good. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>rlando</strong>: Oh that’s good, right?</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: hy you looking for Verona anyway?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to
kill me…</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Ah, so this is about the Don Kim
situation.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: What do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: I know you pulled the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Of course I pulled the trigger! WHY</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: O…kay…</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Whoa, Chelios. You good, man?</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: his shit’s not working.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>hev</strong>: I think I know what I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Well, a man’s got to do what a man’s got to
do. Uhh… what exactly is it that you got to do?</p>
<p><strong>hev</strong>: Got to kick… some black… ass.</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rlando</strong>: There he goes again.</p>

you doing out there?</p>

me.</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: eah, whatever. Look, just thought you’d like
to know that I’m all about hooking up with that mystery girl you’ve been
banging as soon as your ass is underground … I forgot to say so on that
gay James Bond tape I left for you…</p>
<p><strong>23a 23a</strong>: Yeah, yeah, then you’re going to rape my
grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think
when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>23b</strong>: more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR
has pulled up behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to
“PULL OVER” out of its intercom.</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: arlito? That’s funny, I guess you didn’t
know… Carlito’s my boy now, we’re tight.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: You haven’t been tight since your brother
fucked you in 3rd grade.</p>
<p><strong>verona</strong>: lever. Snappy. Did you pretty good, didn’t
I, Chelios? Come on, you can admit it.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: We’ll see.</p>

Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc miles</strong>: Listen, Chev - you have to keep
moving.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: Explain.</p>
<p><strong>doc miles</strong>: If I’m right, they gave you the Beijing
Cocktail… very nasty … works on your adrenal gland, blocking your
receptors. The only way to slow it down is to keep the flow of
adrenaline constant.</p>

The shit they gave you is cutting off your adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>oc miles</strong>: xcitement, fear, danger … it causes your
body to manufacture a chemical called ephedrine … it binds with
receptors in your blood to keep you alive … what they’ve done is
introduce an inhibitor into your system … it blocks the receptors so
your body’s ephedrine can’t bind … and that’s what’s killing you.</p>

the level of ephedrine in your body … to force out the inhibitors …</p>

<p><strong>doc miles</strong>: You’ve got to get to an emergency room
and get yourself some epinephrine … it’s artificial adrenaline … it
comes in 10 milligram syringes … the shit’s potent so don’t overdo it …

the endorphins rushing into to your brain that you’re feeling.</p>

stunning. I’ve never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep
ticking. You should be in a fucking medical journal or something.</p>
<p><strong>chev</strong>: So… what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>doc miles</strong>: The solution I’m giving you is acting as
a competitive inhibitor… meaning it pushes the poison out of your
receptors and replaces it with a chemical… it’s a temporary fix…</p>

could maybe string you out for a few days, but at some point you’d

a GIFT… a warrior’s death… hell, you’d probably get off on it…</p>
