<p><strong>1 ext. beach house - montecito, california - day 1</strong>:
A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara coast line
frame this party of old friends. A trio plays Brazilian music as guests
carry drinks and nibble on dessert.</p>
<p><strong>2 close - on a foursome of friends 2</strong>: The Couple who
live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink champagne as they chat with
their closest friends, JANE AND</p>

<p><strong>jake</strong>: Exactly…. Happy… Anniversary. You two have led
an extraordinarily blessed life.</p>

<p><strong>sally</strong>: Aw, that’s it?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know, I hate it. Well… Congrats again… Great
party…</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, I have some – stuff I have to get done
tonight for work… I’ll see you two in New York.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Absolutely. Lookin’ forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Good. Well….</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: – Jane, what are you wearing to the
graduation?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, a suit or dress, probably a suit.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Fancy. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: See you there, Janey. Where are you staying
again?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: We’re at The Park Regent. You said you were at
The Four Seasons, right?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t know. Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: We’re at The Park Regent too.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh. Good. That’ll be convenient, actually.
Okay, so, see you soon..</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: – I’ll walk you out.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: So, Ted, do you think you can help us get
Pedro into El Montecito for kindergarten?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I thought it was sweet how well you and Jake
were getting along. Felt like old times.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, well, we know how to do this by now. It
has been ten years.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>3 twenty-three year old gabby 3</strong>: in jeans and a tank
top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is
Jane and Jake’s middle child. But unlike most middle children, this one
has never suffered from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as
your mother. We are:</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Gabby, stop…you’re never going to fit all
this in… you can come back for the rest tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: I can’t come back t—</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Oh, God…that’s all my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: he sees an SUV heading to</p>
<p>****: 6.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Gabby, you’re leaving now? I thought you were
going in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: I know but my friends are all there and they
wanted me to come tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: But honey, it’s gonna get dark soon. You can’t
see out the back window. It’s Saturday night. People will be on the road
drinking…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Mom, she’ll be there in a couple of hours,
she’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Okay, I’m leaving this stuff here. I’ll be
back for it in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Want me to drive it down in the morning? I
could be there by lunch. We could go to that big Bed, Bath, and Beyond,
buy kitchen stuff… Gabby, can you look up from that thing??</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: I got it covered, Ma. Hey gangsta, help me
carry these…</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Yep….</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the house
alone?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What are you….? No! – I’m not! One of you is
always moving out… But I am wondering who I’m gonna watch The Hills
with?</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Mamacita… I’m gonna miss you.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I’m doing this. Mom, you
don’t happen to know where Dad is, do you? I tried calling him to say
goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He was at Sally and Ted’s.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: He was? How was that? You and them at the
same – – not that it’s in any way, any of my… was just…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – It was…. – whatever. It was fine.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Was her lunatic child there?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not this time. Gabby, call me when you get
there. Do NOT forget.</p>
<p>****: 8.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: I will. I’ll call you!</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Knock `em dead, little one.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: And call us when you get there, too. And no
texting and driving.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: They grow up so friggin’ fast. I hate
it.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Maybe you should get a dog.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh my God. Goodbye you two. Love you.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: getting into the</p>
<p><strong>4 int. jane’s house - continuous 4</strong>: A Woman’s house.
Books and art collected over years. Interesting, unexpected pieces of
furniture. Jane kicks off her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep
breath!</p>
<p><strong>5 int. kitchen 5</strong>: Cramped, but clearly a cook’s
kitchen. The Kids have left a few glasses and plates on the island.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. the bakery - montecito - day 7</strong>: This is
Jane’s other home. A large, bright, bustling BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The
bakery counter could rival any in Paris. Last year, The New York Times
rated Jane’s pain au chocolat the best in the United States. A line
waits to get in.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Reynaldo…</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: Too much sugar.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Little bit.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Who wants coffee while they’re waiting?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Check on table five, will you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Peter!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jane, I can’t remember, have you ever met
Adam Schaeffer?</p>
<p><strong>jane adam</strong>: No. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well….</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look what we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Your plans.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So excited!</p>
<p><strong>8 int. jane’s small office - upstairs at the bakery
8</strong>: A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls,
posters for Jane’s two cookbooks, framed food photos and a few
reviews.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’ve been thinking about this addition for ten
years.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice….I like this wall
of windows, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That was Adam actually.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh. Love where you put the stairs. That’s so
good!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Adam’s idea…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally - I have a
real kitchen with four walls… It’s…oh, wow…you actually understood what
I wanted!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m happy you like it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You read all my e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: All 47 of them.</p>
<p><strong>office manager</strong>: Jane, it’s 10:15.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It is? Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30… dentist. Can
you leave these and I’ll make a few notes? Well, actually, I have one
tiny note now. In my bathroom…um…no his and her sinks.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay, sure. No his?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Just hers.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And you don’t think in the future you might
want a his?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, God, we’re talking code about my life,
right?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, no, didn’t mean to be.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: The truth is, in my current bathroom, I have
two sinks and sometimes the other sink makes me feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: One sink. Not a problem. Can we schedule a
meeting for next week? Does Tuesday work for you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Tuesday’s great. Eight-thirty too early? At
the house?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. doctor’s office - following 9</strong>: Way too chic
for a dentist’s office. Jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled,
well upholstered examination room. The door opens quickly and a
handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hi. I’m Dr. Moss.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted to start
with… and please don’t take this the wrong way but I’m the type of
person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moss</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You do? Good, because, you know, some women
can look a little fake and plasticky. And in my opinion – worse.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moss</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, that’s good, so, well, as against the
whole thing as I am, I do have a problem that’s been bugging me. My left
eyelid is really saggy. I find I’m sometimes holding it up when I’m
watching TV or reading and I was wondering if that’s something you could
fix.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moss</strong>: It’s resting on your eye lashes.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. moss</strong>: Actually you have the same amount of
excess skin on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I do? Well, I’m only interested in fixing one
eye.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moss</strong>: Jane, what you need to fix this is a brow
lift.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: A brow lift? Wh-what is that exactly?</p>
<p><strong>dr. moss</strong>: We surgically cut at your hair line.
Incision goes right across here. Then we just lift the skin up a little
tighter across the skull. We staple it back in place right above your
ears. Recovery isn’t all that bad but you could be fairly numb and
you’ll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6
months.</p>
<p><strong>10 int. elevator doors opening 10</strong>: Jane flies into
the elevator, out of breath and a little nauseous. She taps on the Lobby
button. The elevator moves down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks
into an empty hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility
Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Jane!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – Hey..</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hiii.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: – Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hold on Pedro, I’m talking to someone.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Pedro, up! Now!!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you doing in this building?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Dentist.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You don’t go to Sharon anymore?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Uh, no… changed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Honey, don’t do that..</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – See you in the Big Apple.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: with a kid on his head,</p>
<p><strong>12 int. jane’s kitchen/dining area - that night 12</strong>:
Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is flowing and
the women are laughing. TRISHA has happily never been married. JOANNE is
widowed and DIANE is divorced. They are all Jane’s age and have been
friends forever.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: That is beyond….</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – When the three of them got in the elevator…
between that and the staples and the headache for six months… it was the
most insane hour of my life.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: – Jake has lost his mind.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I know. First of all, he was a complete prick
for cheating on you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, can’t disagree with that.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: And then he marries her… a known lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: She has a big job.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: Why do you always say that?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Because she does. She runs the whole marketing
department at KY, whatever that station’s called so she’s not that big
of a lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Janey, come on, he cheats on you with her,
your 20 year marriage ends then six months later she leaves Jake for
some random guy, has a baby, leaves that guy, marries Jake and she’s not
nuts?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Jo, you’re so lucky Jerry’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Oh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No, I mean, you never have to bump into
him.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: Janey, you want to meet a guy I met on
Match.com that I didn’t like?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Gee, what a great offer. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: He wasn’t that awful.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oooo. Sounding better every minute.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: You know it’s not healthy not to have sex
for…however long it’s been…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Trust me… I’m not not doing it on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Okay. I don’t know if this is true, but I
read on line about this woman who hadn’t done it in so long her vagina
closed up.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What!!! Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I swear to God. It grew back together.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Wait. Was it ever one piece?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: All I know is, she had to have a
vaginaplasty.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: Ouch!!!!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh my Goddddddd.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: talks as if she’s in the</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: Bubbee, you want to fix your situation? Just
date someone. Seriously. Anyone.</p>
<p><strong>16 ext. the park regent hotel - nyc - day 16</strong>: CAMERA
BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and Harley, just out
of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their luggage as the Girls spot their
brother, LUKE, heading toward them.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Love when we’re all in the same time zone.</p>
<p><strong>a17 int. the park regent lobby - moments later a17</strong>:
They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: So, what’s up Luke? Did you decide to have
the party?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, yeah. Big time.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What party?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Are you guys gonna sleep over?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: If you give us your bed and change the
sheets.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You’re having a party? When? Hi. Adler. Two
rooms…hopefully next to each other.</p>
<p><strong>reception clerk</strong>: I have an Adler, J. in a Superior
Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I’m sorry, here it is. Adler J – two
Standard Doubles. Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, we’re not the ones in the Superior
Suite. Have the other Adlers checked in yet? Just wondering.</p>
<p><strong>reception clerk</strong>: No, they haven’t, ma’am. Not yet.
Now I just need a credit card and your signature.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: – Mom, is it okay if the girls come with me
now and help me set up?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: And by girls he means the three of us.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have
reservations for all of us for dinner. That’s not happening now?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t know. Me and my friends are having
this huge thing at our apartment and the girls said they’d help us set
up.. We’re going to be together all day tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: – Mom, it’s his last night before
graduation.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay, okay. Do you want me to help or…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: – Love your credit card….</p>
<p><strong>17 int. hotel elevator - moments later 17</strong>: Jane
rides the elevator carrying both girls’ jackets and carry ons as well as
her own. Just as the doors are about to close, a Good Looking Couple in
their early forties gets on. As they go up. The Guy has his hand around
the woman’s waist, his fingers fanning her butt. The Couple looks at
each other, smiling privately. Jane looks away.</p>
<p><strong>18 int. jane’s room - 20 minutes later 18</strong>: Two
double beds. Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully dressed, shoes
off, eyes wide open.</p>
<p><strong>20 int. hotel bar and restaurant - top floor - night
20</strong>: Jane ENTERS the hotel’s posh bar/restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi. Adler. One.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Hi. Your table’s almost ready Mrs. Adler.
Would you like to wait at the bar?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Sure. You don’t happen to have another Adler
coming in, do you? Adler for two?</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: No… You’re our only Adler this evening.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>angle - the bar</strong>: Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot
Younger Women.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Pinot Noir, please. No, you know what? I’ll
have a Tanqueray Martini very dry with a twist.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Where’s your….??</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Pedro got the stomach flu so I’m flying
solo.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Really? Didn’t know you knew how to be by
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Any chance you could just go easy on me? Just
a one night free pass. You look good, Janey.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You do. You always do. Your hair’s
shorter.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Longer.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Mrs. Adler, your table’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Want some company, Mrs. Adler?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – We both have to eat. When’s the last time we
ate a meal together?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Just the two of us? Alone? 1999.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So, come on. Once every ten years.</p>
<p><strong>21 a half hour later 21</strong>: New drinks arrive for Jane
and Jake. Physically, they’re sitting as close as they’ve been in a
decade.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So…how are things in the fertility world?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I can’t believe it took you this long to bring
that up.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Sperm issues?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Apparently. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: A baby?! Really Jake? So…the next time you go
to a graduation, you’ll be what? Fifty-eight plus…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – I think the number you’re looking for is
79.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay. So. Seriously, how is that good?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why are we talking about this? I thought we
were going to have fun.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Where’d you get that idea?</p>
<p><strong>22 a bottle of wine is opened 22</strong>: and poured. The
bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are sitting a little closer
together.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – Just tell me, how long were you seeing him
for?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, please, it was five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know but I always wondered so…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Little jealous?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: The man’s married now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t care. How long?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Eight months.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Long….</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not long.</p>
<p><strong>a23 later a23</strong>: The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake
are finally eating but still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story
and she can’t stop laughing.</p>
<p><strong>24 brandy time 24</strong>: A DJ spins for the after dinner
crowd. Couples dance on the dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the
song.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This song reminds me of your birthday party…
the one in our old house…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – Oh, yeah. That was such a fun night.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So fun. You wore that white halter dress….</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, yeahhhh….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Want to dance?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – No…!</p>
<p><strong>25 the dance floor - moments later 25</strong>: Jake and Jane
are dancing…it’s familiar yet with the blush of the new. Something’s
going on here. Jake starts singing. Jane joins in. This is by far, the
loosest we’ve seen her. Of course, it helps that she’s drunk. They dance
around one another without inhibition. A mating dance….</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You’re married to someone else…!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tell me about it!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hey…. I know you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And I know you….</p>
<p><strong>26 int. jake’s suite - later 26</strong>: They’re in bed and
they’ve done it. They’re not even entirely undressed. They’re spent,
sweaty, breathing heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane’s vagina, gives it
a solid pat and hold.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Home sweet home.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh……God………</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That was one crazy ride…thought we were going
to break the bed.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – I’m having an out of body experience.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Totally. You’re so great, Janey. I forgot how
great. Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Please shut up. I’m so dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And the pilates are payin’ off by the way.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Look the other way.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: `Cause I have to get up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jane…I know what you…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Look the other way Jake!!!</p>
<p><strong>27 int. bathroom 27</strong>: Jane sits on the floor, by the
toilet, looking wiped out. Jake gingerly steps into the bathroom, hair a
mess, wearing boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: WHAT is wrong with us?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean? This was amazing. We just
had a great time.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: A great time? This is the dumbest thing two
people have ever done.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Really? I don’t know…. I haven’t thought it
out, but off the top of my head I’d say it was smokin’ hot so something
about it wasn’t so dumb. And, FYI, I like that you stopped getting
bikini waxes. You’ve gone native. I was into it.</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. washington square park - nyu graduation day

<p><strong>lauren</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah. Totally.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I would like to propose a toast to your
Mother.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: To me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve done my part with you guys, but Jane… you
– very talented you…</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Gabby, I’m serious. Jane, you did a
magnificent job, as you always do…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: When I look at the three of you beautiful
kids…all grown up, I think of all the work your mother did, much of it
without my help…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Dude…pull it together.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – Janey, I take my hat off to you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay, Jake. Thank you. Out of nowhere, sudden
appreciation. But thank you. Really.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not totally out of nowhere, Jane…if you know
what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Which I don’t…but…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: What’s he…?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – Have no idea. Let’s move on, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: I’d like to say something too. For real. No
offense to the lovely Agness or her charming offspring…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – Not nice.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: I know. I’m sorry. But I just want to say I
really loved today, just being with the original five… – plus Harley,
but he’s like one of us. I don’t think we’ve ever done this before… Had
a meal together. And hung out like this…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: You mean other than the first 13 years of
your life.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I know what’s she saying. It’s been
awesome….just for a whole day to be just… us.</p>
<p><strong>31 int. the park regent lobby - later 31</strong>: The Adlers
are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next to each other, signing
their credit card receipts, the Kids chat behind them.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Something feels right in the universe again,
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So who’s coming home when? No one’s told me
the details.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey. How’s Pedro feeling?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Okay, we’re gonna help pack Luke up, the
three of us leave day after tomorrow and Luke’s home the end of the
week.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – I will. Call you when I land. Janey, what
flight are you on?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m on the uh, the four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ah, too bad. I’m on the five o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s nuts, why don’t you try to get on the
same flight?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, I could try.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It’s been…great, but let’s not … push it.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: He was just trying to be nice.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know. Okay, I’ve got to hit the road,
guys.</p>
<p>****: 32.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It was really fun.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It was.</p>
<p><strong>34 a tree lined montecito lane - moving shot - day
34</strong>: We are looking THROUGH A WINDSHIELD and listening to a
SELF</p>
<p><strong>male narrator</strong>: – Just follow a few basic rules to
make your divorce a less hurtful one by breaking the cycle of
conflict.</p>
<p><strong>male narrator</strong>: Accept your ex, for who she is.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: A very big ho.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And try to remember when you fell in love
and…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: – There she goes…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jane!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s Adam…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It’s 8:30 Tuesday morning!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Are we still okay?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes! Totally forgot! I’m so sorry! Can you
give me a lift back to the house?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sure…come on in.</p>
<p><strong>male narrator</strong>: – But perhaps the most important
lesson in going through your divorce is to learn to forgive. Forgiveness
is the key to–</p>
<p><strong>male narrator</strong>: In spite of your hurt feelings, prove
to her that you can be a mature–</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Just getting a divorce?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah. Two and a half years ago.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wooo.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s been a process.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Here’s the good news. In two more years you’ll
actually begin to feel normal again.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: In two more years I’ll begin to feel normal?
Why am I having trouble seeing that as good news?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Maybe that was just my experience.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh God, I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. house - later 35</strong>: Blue prints are spread on
a garden table. Adam is drawing as Jane watches.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: – So if we move this wall back a bit, that can
bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes, I’d love that.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thought so.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I have an idea… what if we move my bedroom
like six or eight feet so I can get more of the morning light?</p>
<p>****: 35.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: – Yes, but you’ll wake up in the morning, open
your bedroom door and fall 12 feet into your kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up there!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But I get where you’re headed. Let me see what
I can do… This property is so great… Have you lived here a long
time?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: About ten years. I bought this place right
after my divorce but it’s taken me until now to be able to finally do
this….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good morning! Am I interrupting…?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi. No, well, we were just about done. Adam,
this is my ex-husband, Jake. Jake, this is Adam Schaeffer, my
architect.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Can I take a look? Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Everything’s not 100% worked out yet…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Wow. You’re finally getting the kitchen you
always wanted…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Huge bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It’s not huge. Why don’t I show these to you
when we get a little closer.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So, I think next we should stake out the
addition… see how it all feels - size wise…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll e-mail you and we’ll set it up. We did
good work today. Jake, nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Got time for a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>36 int. jane’s kitchen - moments later 36</strong>: Jane
moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge, taking out
juice…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why haven’t you returned any of my calls or
e-mails?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Jake, come on. This is just too weird. We have
to just never do what we did - ever again. You’re an adulterer and I’m
an awful person, basically. I haven’t slept in days. What we did was
just so wrong on so many levels.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And it was so right on a couple of levels too.
Admit it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No! It wasn’t! On no levels was it right!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You can’t say we didn’t enjoy each other’s
company. Sitting at the bar, dancing…after dancing… Come on, you and I
haven’t had fun like that in a hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes! Because we’re not supposed to have fun
like that! We’re divorced! Are you like, what? Unhappy at home? Does she
not “understand” you? Did you just want to know what it would be like
with someone my age? What is this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’d be lying if I said I never think about
you, Janey. I think about you. A lot. And no, it’s not perfect at home.
Obviously. Look at me. I’ve got three grown kids and I’m going to
kindergarten interviews. I’m a walking cliche.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And I can’t, literally can’t stop thinking
about what happened in New York. Fate brought us together once, maybe it
happened again. And I know… you’ve moved on with your life, I get it,
but you can’t deny something real and honest happened that night. Can’t
we just go with it, see where it takes us. No one has to know. You were
so great. So loose and sexy. How often do you get to be like that? You
can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what
about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night…?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not high on my list these days.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But what if that someone is someone who’s
known you since you’re 23 and loved you for most of your life.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I forgot what a good lawyer you are.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Give this a shot, Janey…. Life is short and
it’s tough. Don’t discount what we have with each other. You know what
they say… people in nursing homes who have plants live longer than the
people without plants.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, so you’re saying you think this is a
healthy choice for me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Honey, I know it is.</p>
<p><strong>37 ext. jane’s garden - sprinklers going off 37</strong>: And
the plants get watered.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. jane’s bedroom - a little later 38</strong>: Jane and
Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and sober. They catch their
breath.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, God, it’s official. We’re having an
affair.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why do you need to label everything?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Because that’s what this is.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes, in its crassest form, maybe, if we were
two other people.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Just because we were married for 19 years does
not not make this an affair.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, but since we were together for so long,
it’s not really that wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Really? You want to run that logic by your
wife?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Do me a favor, you’re on my side. Can we
switch? I feel disoriented.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Since when is this your side?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Since ten years ago. Please…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Could I interest you in a little…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why do you think the sex is so much sexier
this time?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’ve gotta get to work.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Me too. Okay…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: See what happens when you’re not looking out
for me. She lets me eat everything.. pasta, cream cheese…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Can you hand me my robe?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why do I have to..?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – Because the last time you saw me standing up
naked I was in my forties. Things look different lying down. Just…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ve gotten a little nuts.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Jake, I think it would be really good for us
to not talk for a few days. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know what I think – just for the record? I
think we’re doing something kinda brilliant. All the things that tore us
apart aren’t issues anymore. I’d say our problems actually went
away.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What..?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Didn’t you always say you felt you weren’t
being heard? Wasn’t that our big issue – both of us always feeling
rejected and unappreciated. Look at us now. You’re so much more
together, you’re not exhausted all the time, you’re not catering every
weekend and busy all day with the kids and I’m calmer, less obsessed
about work. I’m a partner. I’m there. We grew into the people we wanted
each other to be! And I don’t know… I appreciate things about you I
couldn’t even see before.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>****: 42.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – Do you remember never having time for sex?
Now look at us. We’ve already done it two times this week and it’s only
Tuesday. I swear to God, if half the couples who got divorced, could get
back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved. I think
we’re on to something.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not sure I agree and…also, we’re not back
together.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And I know other divorced people think about
this…they wonder - what if…. I think this is very French of us.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: How is this French of us?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have a young wife but I’m having sex with my
old wife. Not old, you know. Ex! I didn’t mean old…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re doing that thing where you act like
you’re not listening… but think about what I’m saying, okay? Do you have
any of your homemade granola here? I haven’t had it in so long.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You miss it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So much.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the store.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, why give it away when you can… Kiss good
bye?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She wants to be courted! I can do that! And
honey, thanks for the…. – Coffee….</p>
<p><strong>40 int. jane’s house - night 40</strong>: Jane carries three
beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE LIVING ROOM where her Friends
are gathered. Platters of food and open bottles of wine are on the
coffee table.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: Oh my God, now what? Three pies?! This is a
feast!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on, I have so much
energy lately which I think is probably a result of… all the sex I’m
having. Yeah. I’m actually not kidding. I’m having an affair. With a
married man.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What? When did this happen? Where’d you meet
him?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, it… started in New York.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: In New York??? Last week?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, we did it once there and once here.
Maybe more than once there, I was drunk so…</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: You had drunken sex with a married man in
New York when you went for Luke’s graduation?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Turns out I’m a bit of a slut. Apple,
Blueberry or Plum?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on…. You’re not
saying!!!!</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: – What?</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: No! You’re not!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, God, but I am. I’m having an affair with
Agness Adler’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: That. Is. Genius!</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: But also sort of wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh, please. Not that wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know! I’m so happy to be able to tell
someone. This is the most out of control thing I’ve ever done.
Literally. You know me.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Yes we do. You don’t do anything wrong, or
bad. Ever. So you’re allowed this one. I’m sorry … I kinda love it.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: He was yours first.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: True. Not that I want him back by the way.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: Of course not. You can do better than
Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: I mean you’ve outgrown him. You’ve
blossomed, you feng shuied your whole life… Just please, don’t let him
talk you into saving him.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I won’t…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: There is something kinda perfect about this.
You don’t have to cook for him or clean up after him or actually even
sleep with him….</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: But, girls, what about the fact that I’m now
the other woman? I’m the one we hate.</p>
<p><strong>trisha</strong>: Oh, forget that. Agness is still the one we
hate. Even in this scenario.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch on this
one.</p>
<p><strong>41 int. bakery kitchen - day 41</strong>: Jane walks through
the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper. Her shirt is a little more
fitted. Her make up, a little prettier. She crosses to the head Baker
who’s just taking a tray of cookies out of the oven.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Reynaldo, I’m changing the breakfast menu,
want to give it a little more life… What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: – What’d you do? Something to your
hair?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: Something about you looks different.
Little more “caliente.”</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Caliente?</p>
<p><strong>reynaldo</strong>: You see it Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Whatever it is, it’s workin’.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hello. No! I didn’t do this again!</p>
<p><strong>42 ext. jane’s open field - late day 42</strong>: CAMERA
MOVES IN on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of the field. Jane’s
addition is staked out with orange tape.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Adam, I’m so sorry. My mind is just… Forgive
me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If I were your shrink I’d say maybe you don’t
really want to build this house.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That’s completely not true. I’m really sorry.
Oh! I like it already!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah, it’s feeling really good. So, this
becomes your office. We come down your new hallway, the windows are all
along here…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Great. Love it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And from here to there…wait, let me get the
door for you… Your kitchen. We’re in the eating area. How’s the size?
We’re at either end of the table.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Feels perfect.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I thought so too.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: This is heaven!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s gonna be cool. Want to go upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So if you were lying in bed, this would be
your view.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. bathroom - jake’s house - same time 44</strong>:
Water is running in the sink, even though no one’s at the sink. Jake is
in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting away his cell. He quietly
pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small
snap. Jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water. He checks his
watch when he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness
calling his name in anger. He leaps.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: What were you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Going to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: The toilet didn’t flush.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes it did.</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Why were you in the shower with your clothes
on?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: I heard the shower door close.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you have, x-ray ears?</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: What’s up Pedro?</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Jake took a shower with his clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Pedro! Darling…</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t speak Pedro. That’s your
department.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Don’t go in the kitchen, P, I broke
something. Yo. Can you help?</p>
<p><strong>45 two gorgeous croque-monsieurs - coming out of an oven
45</strong>: These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are
carried to Jane’s counter. We’re:</p>
<p><strong>int. jane’s kitchen - early evening</strong>: Jane very
professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two waiting plates, adds
some salad on the side. Adam stands nearby with a glass of wine, jacket
off.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That looks amazing.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It’s called a croque-monsieur. It’s one of the
first things I learned to make when I lived in Paris because the
ingredients are really really cheap.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: When did you live in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: In my early twenties. I went there to take a
six day pastry class and ended up staying a year working as an
apprentice in a bakery.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails and turning
them into something so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You are rapidly becoming one of the most
appreciative clients I’ve ever had…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, I’m not all that used to being able to
count on anyone…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>46 jake driving - same time 46</strong>: He squints, looking
ahead, SEES:</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know it’s none of my business but… I’m
trying to figure out why someone like you is divorced.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And what’d you come up with?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Something in the you’re too nice
department..?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, that and my wife fell in love with my
best friend. Ex-best friend.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We were all on a biking trip, he and his wife,
me and my wife…through Tuscany and on the last day of the trip they
announced they were in love.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah. Not a great plane ride home.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I can imagine, sitting there for eleven hours
with your wife who you know is – oh, that’s rough.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Actually they went on to Venice and I flew
back with Carol, his wife. You can’t imagine what it’s like to sit next
to someone who’s been crying for ten straight hours.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t blame her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was talking about me. Anyway, they’re
married now and it’s pretty much an ongoing awful thing. But, you and
your ex… When I saw him stop by for a cup of coffee the other morning, I
thought – Wow! That’s the way it’s supposed to be. You two seem to have
it all figured out.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: We’re not as figured out as you’d think.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. house - same time 48</strong>: Jake, in work-out
clothes, sprints across the front lawn, careful not to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>49 back to scene 49</strong>: Jane clears their dishes.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You know I hope you don’t feel I’ve been
interrogating you, but…</p>
<p>****: 53.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh, constantly actually.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Constantly?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Everyone I know or have ever known has fixed
me up. And then, sometimes I just meet women, I don’t know how that
happens, but…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – But no girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Just like to date…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Actually, I find it really stressful. You
know, the last time I was in the dating world was 1978. It’s a little
more complicated these days. I can’t tell you how nice it is to have a
conversation with a woman and have the pressure off. Not to mention, a
home cooked meal that no one else I know could possibly cook.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That was a compliment. So you don’t have a guy
in your life at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No…. No.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>ext. jane’s house - same time</strong>: Jake rises from the
bushes outside of Jane’s Kitchen Window. He PEEKS in the window,
balancing himself precariously on a stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane
telling Adam a story and both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further
to try to hear what Jane’s saying when the bricks slip under his feet,
he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>51 int. jane’s house - a bit later 51</strong>: Jane walks
Adam to the door. He holds rolled blueprints.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This was so nice and relaxing and the lavender
ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort I’ve ever had… like,
in my life.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Aw, thank you. I always make ice cream when I
can’t sleep, so I’m glad someone was here to eat it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Great getting to know you a little.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It was really fun.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Woops! Coming!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: O.M.G. I thought he’d never leave. Hello Jane,
you look very beautiful tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Mmmmm. Love when you smell like butter.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Missed you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It’s nine o’clock. Where does your wife think
you are?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: At yoga. Shall we do some downward facing
dog?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not tonight big guy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is it really necessary for you to always say
no before you say yes? I won’t think less of you, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Really, Jake, I’m a little tired, I was just
gonna take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good. So, we’ll just hang out. Ooooo, is that
Croque-Monsieur? Who’s plate is this? Yours or his?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh my God, just as I remember it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Don’t you ever eat at your house?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Pedro dictates all meals and he has a very
limited palate. What kind of ice cream is that?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Lavender Honey.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not at all. You?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Never slept better. And my digestion is
finally back on track. You’ve turned my world right side up, Jane. You
know what this means, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That I’ve never really known how to live
without you.</p>
<p><strong>52 int. jane’s bathroom 52</strong>: Jane takes a bubble
bath. Jake lies on the floor, leaning against the tub, his back to her,
eating a bowl of ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe we should be growing old together.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hate to tell you, big guy, but we already grew
old apart.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s with the `big guy’? Is that because you
think I’m fat or is it a term of endearment?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I have no idea why I keep saying that. I’m
sorry. I’ll stop.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thank you. I love how quiet it is in your
house. I have no quiet in my life. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, well, you live with a five year old.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes…and don’t forget Pedro.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So what does that mean exactly…? What’s going
on over there at your place?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: My marriage is… not turning out as I hoped.
That’s obvious…. Agness started out really looking up to me… We never
used to fight but now… with the kid….lately we’re all about where he’s
gonna go to school and now she says we need a bigger house, more help. I
was thinking of cutting back at work… now that’s never gonna happen. And
she wants another baby before Pedro gets too old which I get but since
we’re always fighting… oh, God, listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Isn’t a baby part of the deal when you marry a
woman that age?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is it? I guess so. She’s got me booked at the
fertility center every other day and she’s so amped up on hormone
injections I may need to find an exorcist if she doesn’t calm down. I
wish it was funny. Incredible ice cream. I’m turning around… Remember
when we used to smoke pot and eat your ice cream in the hot tub?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: The “hot tub”… That feels like a billion years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How long has it been since you…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Me? Since before Lauren was born.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: 27 years?!!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: At least.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Are you kidding me? Put that away! It’s been
too long…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m not going to….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, why don’t I leave this with you… Maybe
you’ll take a few hits…</p>
<p>****: 59.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Maybe….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So that nerdy architect likes you…you know
that, right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He’s not nerdy and he definitely doesn’t.
We’re working together.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was watching when you bent down to open the
oven, his eyes were glued to your ass.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hey, will you do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>53 int. foyer 53</strong>: Jake is on a small ladder,
changing a light bulb in the chandelier. Jane, in a robe, stands beneath
him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tell the truth, Janey is this a great affair,
or what?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t know. It’s my first.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We don’t even have to have sex and it’s fun. I
wish I could sleep over.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I gotta tell my shrink about this. This is a
lot to handle. I guess you should go … I’m sure yoga’s probably closed
by now.</p>
<p>****: 60.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wow, wow, wow…what’s happening, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I always get it. I have three kids. Hello.
Hiii… You still on the plane? How was Luke when you left? Oh, that
sounds like fun. Let me know what I can bring….. No! Don’t have any idea
where he is. Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow. Now I’m lying…… Lauren
and Harley are giving Luke a graduation party this weekend. Sweet,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hello stranger. Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – Just getting in my car. This weekend? Sounds
great. Let me know what I can bring…</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. santa barbara street - early morning 54</strong>:
Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from her bakery.
She’s clearly waiting for someone.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Dr. Allen!</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No, I just need to talk…and I was wondering if
there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session.
I’m sort of desperate for some advice. I brought you some of that coffee
cake you like. Not as a bribe or anything…</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: I only have twenty minutes until my first
patient.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That’s fine. I’ll talk fast.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. building corridor - upstairs - moments later
55</strong>: Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So, at this point, I just need some sound,
unbiased guidance. Is having an affair with you know who a good thing or
a bad thing? It’s a bad thing, right? How could it be good?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: It’s not good. It’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>56 int. office 56</strong>: Jane sits in a chair across from
an empty chair. Dr. Allen turns on a few lamps as his dog settles.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: You know, things happen in life and our
job is to find out why. What we have to do is take a real look at this.
Are you ready to do that?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I am. Definitely. I’ve made a list of what
this can possibly be about…at my end. Can I read it to you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself. Okay. Am I
still trying to figure out why the marriage failed? Do I want to get
back together? Do we have unfinished business? Is this about revenge? Am
I just… lonely? Or, is it my “caretaker” thing?</p>
<p>****: 63.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: And, listen, I get how therapy works, I do… We
look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what….? we’re
going on eight years, right?…. and I’m okay with that, I like it… but in
this case, I need to know what you really think. Like, I’d like you to
say… Don’t do this, it’s absolutely wrong or go ahead, you’ll be fine. I
actually want to be told what to do.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: What’s interesting is I’m already seeing
you open up more than I have in some time. I’m thinking, through this
affair, you may learn to view the world in a different way.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m sorry. I need more concrete. Are you
saying I should keep seeing him? Because, honestly, if the guilt and
fear could go away, maybe I could let go a little and figure this
out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: I wouldn’t resist looking at this.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay… and another way of saying that is….?</p>
<p><strong>dr. allen</strong>: Let go Jane. It can’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. santa barbara fertility center reception - day
57</strong>: Jake is in the Waiting Room with several other “Older” Men
all with their much younger Wives. A Nurse ENTERS, holding a chart.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Jacob Adler?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Have fun…</p>
<p><strong>58 int. fertility center offices 58</strong>: The Nurse shows
Jake into a windowless room with a sink, a pleather barcalounger, a TV
and a DVD player.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Okay, you know the drill. You can hang your
things in the closest, the remote is on top of the TV and the materials
are in the drawers. Please deposit your specimen in the cup and I’ll see
you when you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hey, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: At the office.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Want to grab some lunch?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Absolutely. When?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Can you do it now? I have about an hour.
Thought we could go to The Stanhope….get room service.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Be there in ten!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: See you there, Adler.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She’s comin’ back!</p>
<p><strong>60 int. the stanhope lobby/cafe - day 60</strong>: Harley and
Lauren are having lunch in the CAFE connected to the Lobby. Harley has a
clear view of the Lobby’s Reception Desk. Lauren has her back to it.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: – Luke’s so excited about his party. We can
fit forty people in our place, can’t we?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Sure, if nobody wants to sit down… – Hey,
there’s your…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: My what…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Harley!!!</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to spit on you. I
just needed to kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: While you were choking?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: It worked. I’m not choking anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Who did you just see?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: No one. Thought it was your cousin…but…</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Ohhhh my sweet Lord….</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Honey, I totally forgot I have a conference
call at 1:15, I gotta get back to the office. Waiter! Honey, stop
eating, get the waiter. Call the one over there.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Harley, we can’t leave, we’re meeting with
the Wedding Specialist.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Yeah, you know what? Today’s not a good idea
to do that. Oh my God…!!!</p>
<p><strong>61 int. jake and jane’s hotel room - upstairs - same time
61</strong>: The curtains are drawn, the lights are low. Jane, in a
hotel robe, slips a cd in the cd player and we hear a mellow song,
perfect for love in the afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS and Jake
EXITS, also in a hotel robe.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Jake!!!</p>
<p><strong>62 int. lobby cafe - same time 62</strong>: The Hotel’s
Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley’s table. She holds a
binder filled with photos. Harley is a mess, knowing what’s going on
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>wedding specialist</strong>: I adore October weddings. Let me
show you what we did last October.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Honey, I’m gonna make that phone call from
the…</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: – Okay. Good. You just keep doing that and
I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: What’s the room number?</p>
<p><strong>reception clerk</strong>: 408. Adler. His wife said he’s
conscious now…</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: On my way.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. jane and jake’s hotel room - moments later
63</strong>: Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure
cuff around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel Doc sits
on a chair next to Jake’s side of the bed.</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: Your blood pressure’s good.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: How’s his heart?</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: Do you have a heart condition,
Mr. Adler?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. And I just had a check up.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You did? Oh, that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: Deep breath. So, no chest pain?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: When you got dizzy, did you feel your
heart was beating funny?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes, but I was admiring my beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: – Well that’s nice to hear after all
these years… Did you forget to take any of your medications today?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Took `em all.</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: What all did you take?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh….Lipitor, baby aspirin.. Flomax.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Flomax?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a day.</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: How long have you been taking the
Flomax?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not that long. And I only take it
sporadically. I have to sneak it actually. It reduces semen and that’s
not good for my wife right now. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: Really..?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes, I prefer a lot of semen. Always have.
Okay, well, thank you so much for coming. Looks like he’s gonna live,
so…</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: Yeah, my guess is Flomax is probably the
culprit here. It can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure
so I suggest you stay off it for a few weeks, which apparently your wife
will appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah. Really good for me.</p>
<p><strong>hotel doc</strong>: And I suggest you rest quietly for the
rest of the afternoon. No hanky panky, Mrs. Adler.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No chance. I assure you.</p>
<p><strong>64 int. lobby 64</strong>: Harley sits on a bench with his
head between his legs. Lauren arrives, joins him on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Are you acting like this because of the
wedding? Tell me the truth?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Not at all. Swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Because I don’t want to be one of those
couples where the guy goes into a coma the whole time we plan the
wedding. It’s not worth it to me.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Okay! We’re back in business!</p>
<p><strong>65 oprah - close - on tv 65</strong>: In Jane and Jake’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: See. Just that move…you have no idea. Not
everyone’s like that…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Jake, I have a confession to make. Back when
we broke up… I knew it wasn’t all your fault.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You mean that? You’ve never said that to me
before.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know. Because when you cheated, I didn’t
have to. But I think in some way, I gave up on us and I’m not sure you
ever really did.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I still haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Are you and Agness… still having sex?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Only if she initiates it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m trying not to rock the boat at home until
you and I figure this out. This is a little trickier at my end than
yours.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Right. Yeah. Okay…. Now I know you’re gonna
think I’m leaving because of what you just said, but I’m not. I really
have to get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We got really close there for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hi, hope I’m not interrupting anything.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Adam! Oh! Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I just found out there’s a French Film
Festival in town and that made me think of you so I was wondering if
you’d like to go to the opening night tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, that sounds so fun… Let me think,
tomorrow’s what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – Say you’re busy. Agness has a dinner thing
tomorrow, I can come over. Please.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, um, you know, I’d really love to, but, my
son is coming home from college the next day and I have a bunch of
things I have to do to get ready… I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, don’t worry. No problem. Maybe we can see
something another night.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Absolutely. I would love that.</p>
<p><strong>67 adam hangs up 67</strong>: We see he is holding Two Movie
Tickets. He looks at them then crosses to the desk of a Female
Worker.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Melanie, how would you and your husband like
two tickets to the opening of the French Film Festival? Reserved
seats…VIP parking…</p>
<p><strong>female worker</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>68 int. hotel room - moments later 68</strong>: Jane and Jake
are finishing getting dressed, moving about, putting on shoes, blouses,
ties, jackets, belts…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ll make the whole thing? The roast
chicken, the—</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – mashed potatoes, sauteed string beans and
double fudge chocolate cake. I know your favorite dinner, Jakey.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You haven’t called me Jakey in 10 years. This
has been a great day for us. So, do we have a date?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: We have a date.</p>
<p><strong>69 ext. jane’s patio - late day - music over 69</strong>:
Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in her
courtyard. She’s singing along with the music.</p>
<p><strong>70 a perfect cake - music over 70</strong>: sits on the
Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the cake like the pro she is
then peeks into the oven, looks at her perfect roast chicken.</p>
<p><strong>71 omit 71</strong>: 75.</p>
<p><strong>72 int. jane’s bedroom - music over 72</strong>: Jane clips
the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off its hanger.</p>
<p><strong>73 a clock on a night stand 73</strong>: tells us it’s
8:45.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Why are you taking your cell to the
bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh. Didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Carry him to his bed, will you?</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: And hurry back. I’m ovulating.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Why do you think I cancelled my dinner?</p>
<p><strong>74 int. pedro’s room - continuous 74</strong>: Jake gently
lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro takes Jake’s hand,
holds it to his chest, looking up at him. Jake offers a comforting smile
and Pedro closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. jane’s patio - night 75</strong>: Candles are lit on
the table, but are now low. The table is set with flowers from the
garden. The wine has not been opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE
THE KITCHEN, still dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then
sighs very deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by
room, the house becomes dark.</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. jane’s house - the next day - 6 p.m. 76</strong>: The
Kids cars are in the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>77 int. jane’s kitchen - the same time 77</strong>: Jane,
Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking, setting the table,
opening wine, chatting.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: – Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to tell you
about our meeting at The Stanhope. We went there for lunch two days ago
and met with their Wedding Specialist….I think that could be the place,
Mom….</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Two days ago you went to The Stanhope…for
lunch?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Yes and guess what? We saw nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Who wants wine? Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Mom, you have an insane amount of food in
here, even for you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I knew you were all going to be here for the
weekend so I made a bunch of stuff last night.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Looks like Jake Adler’s favorite meal to
me.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Harley?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yay!!!!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Mom, this looks amazing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where should I put this…?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wherever.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That looks incredible.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Jake? Glass of wine?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh, sure. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Jane?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi Ag… Just got here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know. I’m sorry
guys, I gotta hit it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have to stop at the market. Agness is making
some pasta thing and she ran out of olive oil.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Hey, at least she’s finally cooking.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So…see everybody at the party tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Yeah. It’s gonna be so fun.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I told you I’m bringing someone, right?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: No. Who?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Adam. My architect.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re bringing your architect?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Like as a date?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: I like the idea.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Yeah, seems like it should round out
everything really nicely. Nobody wants wine but me?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Here, now you can stay another five minutes.
You have three bottles in there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Janey, can I talk to you privately? Just for a
sec.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: There you go…. Somebody’s talkin’ graduation
gift.</p>
<p><strong>78 int. courtyard 78</strong>: Jane and Jake stand in the
courtyard off of the Living Room.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What is it, Jake? What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t get not calling me back.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: `Cause I don’t care what your excuse is.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She didn’t go out, Jane. She cancelled her
plans and every time I tried to call or write, she caught me. I wanted
to be here.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You know what, Jake? You were worried about
rocking the boat at home? Well now you’re rocking my boat and I don’t
like it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Honey, don’t let one night…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You don’t understand. I’m not even blaming
you. I fully participated in this. But I don’t want to do it anymore.
The last thing in the world I should be right now is your mistress,
sitting around at nine at night wearing heels and perfume and blowing
out candles and wrapping everything in Saran Wrap because your wife
cancelled her plans. It was cliche and humiliating.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You lit candles?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, shut up. Look, I’ve had a pretty good life
these past 10 years. I figured it out and I moved on. I no longer feel
alone or divorced. I just feel normal. You know how long that took, just
to get my balance back?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: The point is, I’m going in the wrong direction
here. But the worst part is… It’s feeling like it used to feel. All the
little untruths that are hard to catch but add up…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: – Janey, c’mon, it was one mistake…</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: – Everything okay out here? The kids are
gettin’ hungry…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah. We’re done. We were just…</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: – None of my beeswax, Jane. And please never
tell me.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Nothin’, punky.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Yeah? So, we’re going to see you tomorrow
night, for sure, right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay…What did you see and what do you
know?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Nothing. Really.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Okay, he checked in, you arrived, you met in
the elevator, possible kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor came down,
thumbs up. That’s it. Have no idea what happened in between.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Have you told Lauren?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: No and I won’t –</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Mom. Dad’s leaving…</p>
<p><strong>int. house</strong>: Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard
just as Jake is about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table
which now has dinner on it. Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek
then joins the others who are about to sit down for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks for picking me up, Dad…</p>
<p><strong>ext. house</strong>: Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE
DINING ROOM, sees his family sitting around the table, talking,
laughing. He heads toward his car as…</p>
<p><strong>a80 ext. lauren and harley’s cottage - the next night
a80</strong>: Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns
across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a tray of food
and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks.</p>
<p><strong>81 in the bathroom 81</strong>: Jane sits at her dressing
table, dressed for the party. She puts on hoop earrings – likes the way
she looks. She opens a drawer to take out a lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hey….</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey. You look fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m feelin’ a little fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: that, ENTERS, handing her</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Really? Thank you! Come on in. Can you hold
this for a sec? Oh my God… – this could be the best cake I ever made.
You want a piece? It’s like… beyond…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I think I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I can’t believe you brought me a gift?! So
nice!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: An appointment book?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I sort of assumed you didn’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: –Because I never remember our… Awww….</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I took the liberty of filling in our next two
meetings. And marked them with post-its and wrote them in red and then
highlighted them in neon yellow.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not. Wow, that cake is good.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So, let me ask you something and please don’t
think I’m weird or out of line or anything… but do you by any chance
poke smot?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Do I…??</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I mean do you smoke pot?! I haven’t asked
anyone that question since I was twenty-two.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh. No, I don’t. But I have. But I don’t think
I’ve had any since my kids were born…so not in like 27 years.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh my God, we have kids the same age! And I
haven’t had any since my kids were born either!!! Except for tonight. I
had one hit off of this.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You might not want to hold that quite so…
Hello Officer.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: GASPS and DROPS THE JOINT, then TURNS to
Cop,</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jane?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Did you get this high from one hit?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes! I don’t know what they’ve done to pot
over the last 30 years but it rockkkkks!</p>
<p><strong>84 ext. lauren and harley’s cottage - night 84</strong>: From
OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room. Candles dot the
path up to the cottage door. Several Couples and College Kids are
walking toward the house.</p>
<p><strong>85 angle - behind nearby bushes 85</strong>: Jane and Adam
are sharing the joint. Jane takes a tiny, lady- like hit, passes it to
Adam.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Don’t take too much, it’s really strong.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I haven’t had fun in almost three years, Jane.
Bring. It. On.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Who’s got the reefer?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No one. Keep walking please.</p>
<p><strong>86 int. lauren and harley’s cottage - moments later
86</strong>: Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups, ENTER the
party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: How you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Totally fine.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi… love your dress. Hey Harls.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Harls…?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Adam, this is my oldest, Lauren and her
fiance, Harley. We’re on a date.</p>
<p><strong>87 at the bar - wide - moments later 87</strong>: Jane and
Adam chat with all the Kids. Looks like it’s going great – Adam is a big
hit.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: By the way – How great is this party? Let’s be
the last to leave.</p>
<p><strong>spots jake across the</strong>: ROOM, seriously eyeing</p>
<p>****: 89.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hello Jane…. Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Adam, this is Agness, Jake’s wife… Now that is
an odd sentence for me to say since that was me for most of my life.
Seriously. How weird is that? Both of us married to the same man!</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: You know… it’s… hey, what are you gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, why go there.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Because there, is…fascinating. I mean, when
you think about it, it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way,
doesn’t it, Agness? Of all the men on the planet, we both said “I do” to
this guy.</p>
<p><strong>agness</strong>: Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I know you’re
having like an “Ah-Ha’ moment, but I think I’m gonna get a refill. Adam,
good meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s got a really scary tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Janey, can I talk to you for a quick sec?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He always needs me for a quick sec. You
okay?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, I’m very okay!</p>
<p><strong>88 int. tiny bathroom - seconds later 88</strong>: Jane and
Jake are crammed into an extremely tight space.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s going on? You’re acting insane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m stoned.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What?! You smoked the joint I gave you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You told me to! It’s a-mazing!!!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But you weren’t supposed to smoke it with him,
you’re supposed to smoke it with me!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Somebody’s jealous….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes, of course. Why shouldn’t I be… you’re
my…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – What? What am I, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re my ex-wife, lover, oldest friend and
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay. You’re hilarious. And because of that,
even though I kind of hate you/love you, I’m going to let you have
some…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You love me? I mean, I heard “hate” had top
billing, but…</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Oh my God, you’re smoking weed in the guest
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes we are and we’d appreciate it if you
didn’t tell anyone about this.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: No. Never. Adding it to the list.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Care for a toke?</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I don’t really smoke marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Me either.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Okay, one hit.</p>
<p>****: 92.</p>
<p><strong>89 ext. backyard patio - moments later 89</strong>: A small
group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio. Adam and Agness are
dancing together. They’re totally into it. Jane makes her way to the
dance floor as the song ends and The Beach Boys “Wouldn’t It Be Nice”
begins. Jake follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning
Gabby on his way. Jake takes Jane’s hand…dances with her. Harley arrives
next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their parents.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: They must be hammered.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sweetest divorced couple in the world..!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hey..! Jake, I’m gonna….</p>
<p><strong>90 int. adam’s car - moving - night 90</strong>: Adam drives
Jane home. Clearly the end of a great night.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You know what’s great?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How much I like you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thank you… I really like you a lot too…. even
though…oh.. you didn’t say, “a lot”.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But I was thinking it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So… I’m not too old for you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How can you be too old for me when I’m older
than you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I just figured all these women you get fixed
up with are thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Your age is one of my favorite things about
you. Do you think you have any more of that chocolate cake at your
house?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Starved!</p>
<p><strong>91 a black screen - lights pop on 91</strong>: And we are IN
THE BAKERY at ONE A.M. Jane turns on a few more lights, but keeps it a
bit moody.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Officially now the best date of my life. Pre
or post divorce.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Get out… All right….so basically I can make
you anything on the menu or even not on the menu. Just name it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No? Really? Okay. What about a… warm chocolate
croissant?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: My speciality!</p>
<p><strong>int. bakery kitchen</strong>: JANE FLOURS AND ROLLS CROISSANT
DOUGH as Adam, now in an apron, watches, chatting with her. Jane then
places the dough in a machine called a Sheeter. The dough slides into
the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter.</p>
<p><strong>93 int. restaurant - later 93</strong>: Jane and Adam sit at
a table in the corner, a stack of croissants piled high between them.
Music plays as Adam takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh. Baby.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Mmmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s crazy how good this is.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, and I’m not even stoned anymore.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, then…merci, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Do you remember when I asked you the other
night, if you were dating anyone and you said no… It sounded to me like
you were maybe saying yes.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I was sort of seeing someone. But, it’s over
now. Honestly.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: `Cause I’m not strong enough to fall for
someone who’s with someone else. Wouldn’t be able to take that
again.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I understand. I wouldn’t say it was over if it
wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Cooking scar…. From a very hot batch of
caramel…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ooooo. What about that one?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That one’s from boiling sugar…I wasn’t very
skilled in the beginning. And that one is from a large French…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – Saute pan.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Would it be okay if I…?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was going to say, kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I figured.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If you feel this is in any way wrong because
we’re working together…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: … I don’t …</p>
<p><strong>94 omit 94</strong>: 97.</p>
<p><strong>int. jane’s kitchen - the next day</strong>: Quiet. Jane
enters from the garden, humming, “Wouldn’t It Be Nice.” Luke ENTERS,
still looking half asleep in his T Shirt and boxers.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hey sleepy! What time did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Have no idea. Lauren and Harley drove me
home.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: I’m surprised you remember that.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi. I didn’t know you slept here.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: We were playing Scattagories with Gabby and
Ollie then Harley fell asleep on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I got cold in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay, who wants what? Hi baby…</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: What’s Dad doing here?</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. front porch 96</strong>: Jane EXITS as Jake steps out
of his car. He looks like he’s had a rough night and has something on
his mind. Jane cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows
are all open.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I left Agness.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No, don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She saw it my eyes, Janey.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Saw what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That I’m still in love with you. I admitted
it, I told her about us and I’ve left her. For you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No, no, no…. What do you mean??? Jake, this is
crazy! Are you telling me the truth?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This feels so right Jane.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Nothing. Honey, set the table, I’ll be right
in.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Mom, you’re the only one who cares if the
table’s set.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay, then do it for me….just go in
please.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’s up, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Having some problems on the home front, just
wanted to talk to your Mom for a sec.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Problems on the home front? Is one of you
seeing someone else?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, it’s nothing like that. I just need to
find a hotel or something for a few days `til I get my head
together.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: It’s that serious?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Mom, can Dad stay here for a few days? He can
share my room.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t think that’s the best idea, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Daddy, are you crying?</p>
<p><strong>93 on jake - tears welling up 93</strong>: He turns away from
the kids. The tears could be for dramatic effect, could be real.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Mom……..</p>
<p><strong>97 ext. front porch dining area - a little later 97</strong>:
Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently
around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French Toast, bacon,
coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been lifted. His energy is in full
bloom.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Mommy’s the best cook in the world!</p>
<p><strong>98 ext. vegetable garden - later that day 98</strong>: Jane
is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her. She looks up, Jake
stands before her, a cute smile breaking across his face.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thank you for saving me Janey.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Jake, you knew the kids were all here.
Shouldn’t we have talked about this? Agreed this was the right thing to
do? This is so typical. Only thinking about works for you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry, I guess I should’ve called before
showing up.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – And I’m not sure you even left Agness. Maybe
she saw something last night and threw you out…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s the difference? I was drowning over
there. I’m not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure
myself out. Janey, let’s use these couple of days to see if we can make
this work.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: We can’t, Jake. I told you this the other
night. Please listen.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But you were all pissy because you thought I
stood you up. Things are different now. I’m a free man. Can we just hug?
I hate that you’re being so distant. It’s literally giving me a pain in
my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: See! Too much!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay! Good note.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Can I help with what you’re doing? Hold your
basket or…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m fine….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay… I’m going to go to the video store and
get us all a dvd to watch tonight. We’ll have movie night. Just like old
times. How’s that? I’ll make the popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Fine. Hello…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I love knowing I’m coming back here.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, hi… I slept great. How `bout you?</p>
<p><strong>99 int. family room - jane’s house - that night 99</strong>:
The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low. Jake, shoes
off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits in a club chair.
Harley’s on the floor and the Adler Kids are on one long sofa, all
covered in a blanket. Jake hands them popcorn then squeezes back in,
between the Girls.</p>
<p><strong>buck henery</strong>: Are you here for an affair, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dustin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buck henry</strong>: The Singleman party, sir?</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. jane’s house - later that night - est. 100</strong>:
103.</p>
<p><strong>101 int. house - same time 101</strong>: Jake, bare legged
and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to the KITCHEN where he finds
Luke and Gabby digging through the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Any leftovers?</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Any of that noodle thing left? Where’s Mom?
She disappeared so fast after the movie.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: She’s probably sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I think she’s on her computer.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Tonight was weird.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: So weird. Still is.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I loved tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Yeah. That’s why it was so weird. Just seeing
you in your robe in our kitchen. Remember when you weren’t even allowed
in. Mom used to go out to the car to talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You know, I don’t even really remember you and
Mom as a couple.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean… you were ten when we broke
up.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I was eight actually and I don’t know…it’s all
foggy to me now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You don’t remember us in Hawaii or all
sleeping in that tent in the backyard.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, of course, but I don’t remember like you
and Mom hugging or waking up together…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: – It’s okay. I’m not damaged or anything.
You’ve been good parents…</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Speak for yourself dude. I’m definitely
damaged from the divorce.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Hello troops.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why are you still here?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: I don’t know, you and Mom sleeping in the
same house. Harley thought we should stay.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: She exaggerates. I just thought perhaps you
might want to talk later, or … Is that the noodle thing?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I didn’t know anyone wanted any.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. jane’s bedroom - a little later 102</strong>: Jane,
sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her LAPTOP SCREEN, we
see Adam but he’s a bit of a BLUR.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wait, I can’t see that one. Can you back up a
little?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Very festive…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: O-kay. Thank you. Gift from my
ex-sister-in-law. Have no idea why I kept it. Into the pile. Hey, check
out the pile, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Nice! Hey, the pile’s moving….</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Murphy, get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What about this? I was in India and I had it
made.</p>
<p>****: 106.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: And kinda girly.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Not what I’m going for. Gray sweater. Very
old.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: But cute.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You sure? You don’t have to say you like it
just because you nixed the last 20 things.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Keep it. It’s cozy. Boy, you have a lot of
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh, not anymore. Okay, we’re almost done. You
are helping me so much by the way.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – Adam, I really have to pee.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in thirty….
Putting this on my desk….</p>
<p><strong>jane’s voice</strong>: I’m not in there…</p>
<p><strong>on adam’s side - an isight frame of an empty desk
chair.</strong>: 107.</p>
<p><strong>adam’s voice</strong>: Can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. jane’s bedroom - wide - same time 103</strong>: Jake
pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the room. He hears Jane
in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly, quickly squirms out of his boxers
and T-shirt, then, DROPS HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed,
completely NUDE – elbow up, palm supporting his head – a smile on his
face. He changes his smile to a smoulder.</p>
<p><strong>104 int. adam’s bedroom - same time 104</strong>: Adam
crosses through the room on his way to his laptop.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Mother of – Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What are you doing in here?!!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Get it off!!!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why are you naked!?!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: top shooting even more</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay, I’m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Not working! Big close up!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay! Good night!</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Everybody okay?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay. Let me explain. The reason I left Agness
wasn’t just because my marriage wasn’t working. I’ve also fallen in
love…back in love… with your mother. Or maybe I never stopped loving
her.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: Is this a joke?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know this is shocking, but I think this is
the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Your Mom and I have been
seeing each other, on the side… ever since New York.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Mom, is this true?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That part is, but..</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I found my way back home. I just hope she’ll
take me back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why’s everyone crying? Why isn’t this good
news?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Because we’re still getting over the
divorce.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Mom, are you and Dad getting back
together?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No… we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>106 ext. driveway - later - that night 106</strong>: The
Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the house. Jane
stands in the driveway, watching, never before feeling quite like this.
Jake EXITS THE HOUSE, holding his bag. He stops, looks at Jane. She has
nothing left to say. Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks
back inside.</p>
<p><strong>107 omit 107</strong>: 110.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. pool area/backyard - middle of the night
108</strong>: Jane lies on a pool chaise, wrapped in a blanket, tissues
in hand. She stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter shut, we
drift off of her…</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. jane’s pool/backyard - early morning 123</strong>:
CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS THE POOL TO JANE, asleep on the pool chaise, still
wrapped in a blanket. The sprinklers go off and wake Jane. She opens her
eyes, looks around, realizes she’s spent the night outside.</p>
<p><strong>124 a front door opens to reveal harley 124</strong>:
bed-headed and still in his pj’s. He approvingly looks at Jane, who
stands across from him, ready to right it all.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Glad you’re here, boss.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. cottage - continuous 125</strong>: Harley leads Jane
down the narrow hall to the Bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Now I know you don’t need my advice Jane,
but…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I got this one…</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: I know you do.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Knowing how to be divorced is next to
impossible… and sometimes over the years, I’ve thought that your Dad and
I weren’t quite finished. And, as it turns out, we weren’t. So I went
out of my comfort zone, which, I found out, if you’re really honest with
yourself, isn’t all that comforting. So, I experimented with a part of
myself. I wanted to find out if, after all these years there was still
something there between us.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: And was there?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: There kinda was.</p>
<p><strong>gabby</strong>: But Mom, you have to understand how bonkers
this sounds to us. For two people who for years couldn’t be in the same
room together…to then have an affair??? You and Dad…!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know…it was hard for me and I was doing it.
I hope you’ll forgive me for confusing you or betraying your trust, but
I did this for me and for him and I realized even though your Dad and I
once had something extraordinary… we no longer really fit together. But
he is a part of me and always will be.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: So it’s over now? You guys are back to being
divorced.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: For better or for worse.</p>
<p><strong>harley</strong>: Group hug?</p>
<p><strong>126 a moving pov - int. architecture office - day
126</strong>: REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam’s firm. She arrives
at:</p>
<p><strong>127 adam’s office 127</strong>: Adam is on a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah no problem…we can definitely do that… –
James, can I call you back, someone just… Thanks. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi. May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: – Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I didn’t call you last night because I wasn’t
sure you would take the call and then I thought that could go on for
months and…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: – I would have taken the call.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh. Well, anyway, it’s better to say these
things in person. Adam, the man I was seeing was…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I think I’m up to speed on that part.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I want you to know it didn’t last long and
you’re divorced, so maybe you understand, when marriages end, there’s
doubts and hurt, and you’ve got kids and sometimes you wonder if you did
the right thing and when the moment presented itself…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: – I get it. I could imagine it…I could…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I told him it wasn’t going to work between us
but I guess he didn’t believe me and unbeknownst to me, he showed up at
my house yesterday. He left Agness and…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: – Jane. I actually think I understand what
happened but…uh…you know I’m not as macho as I appear and I think it’s
probably best for us not to get any more… involved because your
relationship with Jake isn’t really done and I know you’re saying it is,
but he’s in love with you and for everyone’s sake, that should probably
get resolved.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wow. So that’s how grown ups talk.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Please tell me you’re not going to quit my job
and ask Peter to take over because then I’ll never get to see you
and…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was thinking of asking Peter to step back
in.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh… I hope you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>129 ext. road to jane’s house - late day 129</strong>: Jane
drives home, when she notices Jake’s Porsche in her driveway. She gets
out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the bench swing hanging from a
large oak in the front yard.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: How far back does that sorry go?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How far back do you need it to go?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Way back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Consider it an all inclusive apology. From not
being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last
night.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, what were you thinking with that
move?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That you’d find me irresistible.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Never considered the alternative.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Gotta love that about you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, man, can’t believe I got up to bat again
and blew it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You didn’t blow it. We blew it. We blew it the
first time around. This time… we just should’ve known better. Too much
has happened. Too much time has passed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And you don’t think we could make it
right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Does that mean you didn’t feel it was totally
right either?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Being with you Jane is the best I’m gonna
be.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: But do you agree that it wasn’t really…?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It was complicated.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Begging for an answer.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I thought it was good. I wanted it to be
good.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Guess that’s as close as I’m gonna get.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do you always have to be so hard on me?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t regret giving it another shot.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Probably would’ve been better if you hadn’t
been married.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It may never have happened if I wasn’t
married.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t regret it either.</p>
<p><strong>130 ext. jane’s house - many mornings later 130</strong>:
It’s raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber is being
taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Did you know it’s good luck to start building
in the rain?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes. It’s a well known, very good, really
lucky omen.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Good, I could use one. Would you all like to
have your meeting in the house…it’s dry and I’ve got hot coffee…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Jane, I need to ask you something…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Anything…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to have any of those
amazing chocolate croissants, would you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh…. you like those, huh?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I have incredibly fond memories of them.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t have any here, but we could go into
town and get some… right out of the oven.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah… love to.</p>
