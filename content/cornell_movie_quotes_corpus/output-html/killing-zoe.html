<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hotel Mondial.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Le Mondial. Tres bien.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un
moment. L’autoroute est ferme. A cause du 14 Juillet.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t speak French.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Ah. American?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: That’s good because I speak a little
English.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: I asked if you mind the radio. Music.
You know.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Super cool.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Time, time, time. I don’t know.
Daytime.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Are you in town for business?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: It’s a nice hotel. Your hotel. Very big
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Do you know Paris?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’ve been here once before. When I was
younger.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Those were the days.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Married?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Do you have a wife?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Well, if you need a wife for the night…
Une escorte. Pour vous faire visiter. For business. I give you my
number. Very nice girl. French. Like when you were young.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Speaks the language of love. Take you to
heaven and back. You just tell me and I set it up.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: What you laughing at? You let Moises set
it up. She treat you right. She treat you fine.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Your package…It arrived in the last night
of before last night.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Ah…telephone, for the room service.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: The toilet.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: To hang the clothes.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: From here you can operate the
television.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Merci.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh, wait.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Ah. Yes. Il est presque huit heures moins
dix.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Bonjour.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Bonjour.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Wow. Vous avez une belle chambre. Je ne suis
jamais venue dans cet hotel.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Ca sera 150 francs de l’heure. Toute la nuit
pour 700. D’avance. Et faudra porter un–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I…don’t speak French.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: It will be one thousand francs for all night.
In advance.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: We can do it now if you want.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, let me just dry up.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Okay, but it’s not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Zoe or Zoey. Which ever you like.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: My name’s Zed.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: That’s funny. We both have Z names.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: You can take those off. The pants.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’d rather watch you get undressed first.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Slower.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Alright Mister America. Zed.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Slow enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: C’etait formidable.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I’m cold.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Zed?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Moises told me you were in town for
business.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: What kind of business?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I don’t know. I’m just curious.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Do you ask all your clients questions?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: No. Just the ones I like.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: So you like me?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Because you’re…a good person. I run into some
real creeps. You know.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: How do you know I’m a good person?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Body language. We fit together.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: All men and women fit together. Hell, even some
men fit together.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: No, but you know, we clicked. You made me
orgasm. Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up
with?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Usually never. They’re almost always fat like
pigs.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: And you make me feel safe. That’s something
more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the
orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I never really thought of it like that.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Well, it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Turn off the television.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you
very much.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, I like you too Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Honest?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Why? For the same reason? Any man can orgasm.
Even with his own hand.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, I like your honesty. You’re open. Unlike
most prostitutes I’ve been with.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I am not a prostitute!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really? Can I have my francs back then?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I’m a student. And to pay for the classes I
became an escort. It’s my choice to sleep with you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: What? You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, I do.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Hey, it’s not easy.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I didn’t say it was.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I’m here because I want to.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, okay relax. What school do you go to?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: The Centre du Art, Paris.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That’s really interesting. What kind of art do
you study?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Not any of the old shit.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I have a day job too. Three times a week.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: But someday there will be only my art.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What kind of things do you paint?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I don’t paint. I make things. Objects. Not
like sculpture. Like life…but with no narrative. I want when someone
looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world.
Void of feeling, emotion…void of destiny. Those are left for me. They
belong only to me. If someone else can see into it…then it is no longer
mine. I have failed. And I would destroy it. I don’t care how much cash
they would offer me. It would be shit. I can’t tell you how many objects
of mine have been destroyed. They told too much about me. And if someone
wants to know something about me…I’ll tell them myself. The way I’m
telling you.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: What I do I do only for the objects.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’d like to see one of these.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: What? So you could see the work of a
whore?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Zoey. I’m sorry for calling you a prostitute. I
didn’t understand the difference.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: The difference is a prostitute would have lied
to you about her orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: If these things you make are as true as you
are…I’m sure they’re as indescribable. Perhaps, someday, you’ll make
one…about me.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: If I do…you’ll never know which one it is.
Because I’ll be the only one who understands. I’ll be the only one who
can look into it and see where in my life it came from.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I have no idea. Night time.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: I’m going to take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hey you madman!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Eric. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What happened to you? I thought you were going
to call.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh I see. You have been busy.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a wake up
call.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’s good, but now I am here. So let’s go.
We have a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What about the girl?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Is she your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fuck her.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: She’s a dishrag whore. Kick her out.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’ll let her stay here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t be silly. It’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Eric.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t worry about her.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: God damn it!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: God damn it. Look at my hand.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Jesus Eric.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Ouvres! Je veux mes habits!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh shit. Her clothes.</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: La ferme!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: So tell me, what have you been up to?</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Eric, I liked that girl.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh. Well, then why didn’t you stop me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Because you were on a rampage.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Look, your whole life you’ve done nothing but
fuck whores. A girl like that will give you AIDS. Why don’t you find a
nice girl in the suburbs?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Because when you need to get off you don’t want
to have to date for months to do it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Just use your hand like me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Sometimes you just need honesty…and
security.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t understand. Anyway, it’s too late. Get
dressed, let’s go out and meet the boys.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, let me take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No, in Paris it’s good to smell like you’ve
been fucking. It will make them respect you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m glad you came. How long has it been?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Years.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s amazing, you know? Here you are. One day
in America. Now here.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, to be honest there really wasn’t much
happening for me in the states.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job
for you, so you came. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: How could I resist your invitation?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You would have been stupid to.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: So what have you been doing here?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: After school I spent some time in Algeria
studying African philosophy. And then I bummed around. You know. For
fun. For a while I worked at Le Figaro. The newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And
lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like
terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The people next door are on holiday. We took
their phone. If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Is that cat dead?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t know. I think it’s asleep but it’s
been there for days.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I guess it is dead.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Okay. This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver,
and Claude. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: They all know who you are. Ne soyez pa
salauds. Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Zed, would you like a beer?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Don’t think of it.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Come. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Easy. Don’t scare him. He just wants to
claim you.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Let me introduce you properly. This is
Enrique.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we
don’t always get what we like…do we?</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Tais-toi! Do you like hash?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t sit next to that junkie.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my
Billy Holiday albums. Next time he’s out the door. Zed, come here.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Here you go mate.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t ask me where we got this.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But this one. BIP. The Banque Internationale
de Paris. And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain
closed next Bastille day. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We will go in and shut the bank down. Now,
look at this.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: As you can see, only one person can start the
alarm. The concierge, at this desk. We will take care of him. Then we
can close the bank. No one will know the difference since every other
bank will be closed.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Are you sure he won’t push the alarm?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ahhh! He’s right next to the door. We’d have
to be totally incompetent not to stop him. Don’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Here. This is where they keep the days reserve
cash. Okay fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There are many vaults downstairs, but this is
the vault we must get into. This is where the real prize is.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What kind of vault is that?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ah…Swiss made. A Caliber.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Caliber? It’ll take three hours.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No, that’s too long.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That’s how long it’ll take.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Well shit. It’s too long. We have to be in and
out. Like that. Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay…but
too long and…</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well hold on a second. What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Another vault.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No this.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t know…it connects the two vaults.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, what kind of vault is this other one?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why would those two vaults be connected?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Because I can get into this vault in half an
hour. Maybe less.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But this entry way is too small to get the
platen out. We have a lot of merchandise in there.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, don’t you see? We get in through this
secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault. From the
inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You could open it in five minutes?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: From the inside it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hot damn. That is our answer.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay. When is Bastille day?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Tomorrow!? We’re doing this tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But of course.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s not impossible. Everyone knows what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You don’t need to know shit. Just get into the
vault and we’ll do the rest.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I haven’t even seen the bank.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fuck the bank. Before we do a job we live
life. It’s better that way. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Good. Now we do heroin!</p>
<p><strong>extreme close on</strong>: Eric making heroin.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You have to look at the Starship Enterprise
as a metaphor for the human brain.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain,
all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly
emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer. He drifts between the two.
Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought
processes.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It’s really quite brilliant you know. That’s
why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Do you want heroin?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a
beer…and you’re just right.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: My vein is like a rock.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Try some. It’s called chasing the dragon. The
Chinese have been doing it for centuries.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh, but you must. It will make you feel as
though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you’re
rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There. That’s Notre Dame.</p>
<p><strong>ricardo</strong>: Do you like French cars?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ricardo</strong>: I like the Cadillac. Fifty-two to
seventy-five. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Is tomorrow really Bastille day?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in
French history. And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Watch it! Don’t crash my car.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Over here is where the male prostitutes sell
themselves. Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Fucking fags!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Suce ma bite?!</p>
<p><strong>ricardo</strong>: Perverts d’homosexuels!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: This is good to have you here. We could not do
this without you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Everyone has agreed to give you double shares.
That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You know I have AIDS. From the needle.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: So, how long have you known Eric?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, Eric’s mother is American.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Yeah, and his dad’s French.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: They’re divorced. And she and his father had
some kind of six month split plan set up. So every six months he would
come back to the states. We were best friends. Eventually he and his
mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It’s been…years.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Well, it’s good to have you here. Eric
speaks fairly highly of you. Say, he says you’re a big fan of Viking
films.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well…I suppose. I used to be, when I was
young.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oh they’re the best. Helmets with horns on
them. Shit. That’s fucking genius.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: How ’bout Toy Jazz? You like it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah…I guess.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I love it. It’s really good, you know? Like
real music. It has a heart and culture all it’s own. It’s, like, jazz
for dwarves…or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Hungry cannibals’d like it.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Here, you must drink some of this wine, it’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Non merci, c’est de la merde.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: La ferme. C’est du bon vin. The fucking
English.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Look at him. He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m glad you came. How long has it been?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Years.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s amazing, you know? Here you are. One day
in America. Now here.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, to be honest there really wasn’t much
happening for me in the states.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job
for you, so you came. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: How could I resist your invitation?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You would have been stupid to.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: So what have you been doing here?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: After school I spent some time in Algeria
studying African philosophy. And then I bummed around. You know. For
fun. For a while I worked at Le Figaro. The newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yes. With an assumed Masters degree. And
lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris. You know, like
terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The people next door are on holiday. We took
their phone. If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Is that cat dead?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t know. I think it’s asleep but it’s
been there for days.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I guess it is dead.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Okay. This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver,
and Claude. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: They all know who you are. Ne soyez pa
salauds. Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Zed, would you like a beer?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Don’t think of it.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Come. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Easy. Don’t scare him. He just wants to
claim you.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Let me introduce you properly. This is
Enrique.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we
don’t always get what we like…do we?</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Tais-toi! Do you like hash?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t sit next to that junkie.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my
Billy Holiday albums. Next time he’s out the door. Zed, come here.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Here you go mate.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t ask me where we got this.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But this one. BIP. The Banque Internationale
de Paris. And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain
closed next Bastille day. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We will go in and shut the bank down. Now,
look at this.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: As you can see, only one person can start the
alarm. The concierge, at this desk. We will take care of him. Then we
can close the bank. No one will know the difference since every other
bank will be closed.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Are you sure he won’t push the alarm?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ahhh! He’s right next to the door. We’d have
to be totally incompetent not to stop him. Don’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Here. This is where they keep the days reserve
cash. Okay fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There are many vaults downstairs, but this is
the vault we must get into. This is where the real prize is.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What kind of vault is that?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ah…Swiss made. A Caliber.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Caliber? It’ll take three hours.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No, that’s too long.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That’s how long it’ll take.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Well shit. It’s too long. We have to be in and
out. Like that. Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay…but
too long and…</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well hold on a second. What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Another vault.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No this.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t know…it connects the two vaults.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, what kind of vault is this other one?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why would those two vaults be connected?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Because I can get into this vault in half an
hour. Maybe less.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But this entry way is too small to get the
platen out. We have a lot of merchandise in there.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, don’t you see? We get in through this
secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault. From the
inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You could open it in five minutes?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: From the inside it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hot damn. That is our answer.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay. When is Bastille day?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Tomorrow!? We’re doing this tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But of course.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s not impossible. Everyone knows what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You don’t need to know shit. Just get into the
vault and we’ll do the rest.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I haven’t even seen the bank.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fuck the bank. Before we do a job we live
life. It’s better that way. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Good. Now we do heroin!</p>
<p><strong>extreme close on</strong>: Eric making heroin.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You have to look at the Starship Enterprise
as a metaphor for the human brain.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain,
all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly
emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer. He drifts between the two.
Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought
processes.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: It’s really quite brilliant you know. That’s
why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Do you want heroin?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: No. A little bit of heroin, some hash, a
beer…and you’re just right.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: My vein is like a rock.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Try some. It’s called chasing the dragon. The
Chinese have been doing it for centuries.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh, but you must. It will make you feel as
though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you’re
rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There. That’s Notre Dame.</p>
<p><strong>ricardo</strong>: Do you like French cars?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ricardo</strong>: I like the Cadillac. Fifty-two to
seventy-five. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Is tomorrow really Bastille day?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in
French history. And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Watch it! Don’t crash my car.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Over here is where the male prostitutes sell
themselves. Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Fucking fags!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Suce ma bite?!</p>
<p><strong>ricardo</strong>: Perverts d’homosexuels!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: This is good to have you here. We could not do
this without you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Everyone has agreed to give you double shares.
That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You know I have AIDS. From the needle.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: So, how long have you known Eric?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, Eric’s mother is American.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Yeah, and his dad’s French.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: They’re divorced. And she and his father had
some kind of six month split plan set up. So every six months he would
come back to the states. We were best friends. Eventually he and his
mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It’s been…years.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Well, it’s good to have you here. Eric
speaks fairly highly of you. Say, he says you’re a big fan of Viking
films.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well…I suppose. I used to be, when I was
young.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oh they’re the best. Helmets with horns on
them. Shit. That’s fucking genius.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: How ’bout Toy Jazz? You like it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah…I guess.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I love it. It’s really good, you know? Like
real music. It has a heart and culture all it’s own. It’s, like, jazz
for dwarves…or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Hungry cannibals’d like it.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Here, you must drink some of this wine, it’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Non merci, c’est de la merde.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: La ferme. C’est du bon vin. The fucking
English.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Look at him. He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>extreme close on</strong>: The door to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>sub lobby teller</strong>: Merde!</p>

<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fucking idiot.</p>
<p><strong>stodgy customer</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t you ever conflict with me during work
again! Do you hear!?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You didn’t have to shoot any of them!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you were in
charge now. Nobody told me. If he had opened the vault it would have
saved us a fucking hour.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Eric. It’s just that we’ve gone from being
thieves to murderers.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh fuck it doesn’t matter! Here you get the
death penalty just for robbing a federal bank.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I thought the death penalty was abolished in
1980?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ohhhh! That’s what they tell you! But who
cares? I need to take a piss.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Why don’t you open the vault?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>extreme close on</strong>: Zed’s drill bit. It burrows into
the steel wall of the safe spewing out spiral shavings.</p>

<p><strong>jean</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>:</p>

anyway! I can’t see a fucking think in this!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>male tourist</strong>: This is insane! I am a U.S. citizen!
You must let me go!</p>
<p><strong>male tourist</strong>: I’m an American! American! I’m just
here exchanging dollars. If it wasn’t for my country you’d all be
speaking German!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Eric</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Nothing. They were just scaring them.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, did you tell them to stay quiet?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yes. They’re assholes. Just having fun.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Fucked up my drill bit.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s okay. You can buy another one.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Cross your fingers.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Excellent. What next?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We find the fuse box. It’ll probably be
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll find it for you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No. I need to see it myself.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I think it would be better if I looked for
you. I could–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hold on. Here she is.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and then
back on when I call to you. Any other switch may set off the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t want to do that.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Got it?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Come on sweetie don’t fail me now.</p>

<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh my God it worked!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I can get through that lock in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Then do it. We don’t have all day.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Dime store brand. Three minutes max.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Merde!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Another security guard?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Must be.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I think I stained my pants.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: What is it?! I came down to see how things
were going and heard shots!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Some asshole in the vault.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: We’ve got guns. Why don’t we just storm in
and blast his fucking ass! It’s three against one! Let’s give it the
old–</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’m just trying to be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>eric</strong>: I beat you! I opened it in under three
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Go around and wait at the main vault door. When
I tell you, open it up.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Right. When you tell me, I’ll open it
up.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: I’ll be at the other vault waiting for you

<p><strong>eric</strong>: Look at it! We’re all rich!</p>

<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: This is unbelievable. Look at all of this.
It’s wonderful to touch.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Just help me steer this out.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Do you think we should get some cash
also?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Well, you never know.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Money is too easily traceable. You’d never be
able to spend it. And forget about exchanging it.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No sir. Your best bet is to get these bars
melted down in Tunisia or Korea.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Eric knows someone in Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Or Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Do we have a covering of some kind?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You know. Something to cover this with. It’ll
look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Oh, it won’t matter. The police know what
we’re up too.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Police?! What do you mean they know what we’re
up too?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You don’t know? We’ve been discovered. But
Eric has them under control.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No I didn’t know! How many police?</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: The building is surrounded.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Kill her! Kill her!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What the fuck are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend
that much? She’s really fucked with your mind.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Eric…what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Look at it. It’s all for us. The smoke. The
attention. They have no idea of who they’re dealing with. They have no
idea what kind of men we are.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What kind of men are we?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You can no longer be in our club. You forfeit
your cut of the pie.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What about our friendship?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shit Zed. I haven’t seen you in years. You
hardly know me.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Never let a girl come between two men.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Now let’s try to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Zoe…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: My Zed. They’ve hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You’re going to be okay. In many countries
scars on the face are a symbol of heroism. To proudly display a flaw
like a badge…is to wear a badge of truth.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Be serious Zoe…I can stick my tongue through my
cheek.</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: Oliver! Let’s get a hostage!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: This is the end!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Listen to me. We’re going to lock ourselves
into one of the air tight vaults…if any of them are still open.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Merde! The vault has been closed.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What about the others?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Listen…there’s no gunfire.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Motherfuckers!</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: You wanna fuck with me? You wanna fuck with
me? I’ll show you who you’re fucking with!</p>
<p><strong>zoey</strong>: C’mon, we’ll be safer in here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Zed.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What’s your girlfriends name?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Zed no. I’ll kill you. It means nothing to me,
our friendship.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Eric…there’s no fucking way out of here!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh but you’re wrong. This is my way out. This
dime store couge with her motor driven ass. You find your own.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Come Zed…I’m going to cut you like a
sausage.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Zoey, get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Did you see how she ran? Did you see how she
ran? She doesn’t care about you. Fucking pussy only cares about pussy.
Look out for number one. What do you say Zed?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I will kill you. And once I kill you Zed, I’ll
get out of here. I’ll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS…if
she doesn’t already have it. What do you say to that Zed?</p>
