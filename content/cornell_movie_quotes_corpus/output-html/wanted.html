<p><strong>fade in:</strong>: CLOSE ON the face of WESLEY GIBSON, 25,
STARING AT THE.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.
His wry smile gives way to… Black. And then…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It was Rochelle’s birthday, which meant
there was a certain amount of inter- office pressure to go to Appleby’s
and sit at a table of twenty-five with my boss Janice presiding at the
head even though she’s too tight to pick up the bill. Which meant, the
poor bastard waiting on us had to split the check twenty-four ways –
everyone contributing to Rochelle’s free meal – surf and turf, no less –
don’t do us any favors, Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of extreme
nachos and then polished off a bowlful of spinach dip pretty much
single- handedly… The CAMERA DISAPPEARS in the bowl of spinach dip and
we…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .so by the time I got back to my cubicle, my
eyelids were so damn heavy, I had to put my head down, even if it was
just for a wink.</p>
<p><strong>puja</strong>: I didn’t expect for you yourself to come. One
of the heads, in the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. x</strong>: You’re an important fence.</p>
<p><strong>puja</strong>: I’m flattered. She reaches over to an attach€
case and removes a file.</p>
<p><strong>puja</strong>: The name of the target is Henry Helms.
Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a few feet away
from Mr. X, who rises so that they are both standing. She really is
quite beautiful, exotic even,. with piercing eyes.</p>
<p><strong>puja</strong>: He’s a journalist who stumbled on to a story
exposing a lot of powerful people, people who don’t like having their
power threatened. MR. x Poor Helms.</p>
<p><strong>puja</strong>: There.have been five attempts on his life, but
he has been well protected… and well hidden. Turns out his wife’s family
has a lot of money. He’s in town to accept an award.</p>
<p><strong>mr. x</strong>: We’ll see to it that it never makes his
mantle.</p>
<p><strong>puja</strong>: And for that, my clients will pay handsomely.
Mr. X is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens… .he notices that
the red bindi on he r forehead tarts to move a little, like a second dot
is trying to emerge from it, like an amoeba splitting. It’s a sh
hooter’s laser! His eyes go wide as saucers. MR. x</p>
<p><strong>get down1!1</strong>: .but it’s too late as bullets rip into
her head. splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet
bar.</p>
<p><strong>roof of the next building:</strong>: …and rolls up quickly,
guns ready. His eyes spot FOUR MARKSMEN running and ducking for cover on
the neighboring rooftop.. .and on a dead sprint across the roof… . he
spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from around an
air-conditioning vent. He fiKes the his left band. The bullet flies
through the air and rockets into the flesh… which happens to be one of
the marksmen’s ears. The guy YELPS IN PAIN and falls back from the vent,
exposing himself. That’s all Mr. X needs, and another shot rings out
while he’s still on a dead run. THWAP! The bullet finds its mark in the
yelping man’s forehead, silencing him, just as… .Mr. X ducks behind a
stairwell door. He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of
this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r screen. It actually
shows the heat signatures of the three remaining marksmen, one of which
is directly in front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.
A second marksmen is just on the other side of the stairwell. The third
is on the far side of the rooftop. Mr. X takes another look at the heat
signature of the marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his
gun…</p>
<p>****: C’mon, c’mon, c’mon. He looks out at the stairwell door… and
all is quiet. Maybe Mr. X didn’t know he was there, maybe he left, maybe
the last marksman can sneak away after all.</p>
<p>****: Okay… okay… He finally decides… .and takes one step forward…
THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee. He falls, clutching the knee
in agony, as Mr. X walks toward him slowly until he stands right over
him like a hunter over his prey. Mr. X’s shoe comes down on the final
marksman’s wrist, pinning it away from his dropped weapon.</p>
<p>****: Who sent you?</p>
<p>****: We’re… we’re just the decoys, man. We were paid to get you out
here… The marksman points at a small VIDEO CAMERA sitting on the roof,
relaying their every move… Mr. X’s face falls as.those words register,
and just then… RA ROCKETS over thetreets of the city, block after block
in the blink of any eye… .until it reaches a rooftop, over a mile
away.</p>
<p><strong>on the new rooftop:</strong>: A man named CROSS is in a
crouch, holding a massive RIFLE pointed upward, at an angle… A small
SCREEN on Cross’ gun shows the scene from the roof, along with various
elemental measurements: wind speed, pressure, temperature, distance,
altitude… .. the information on __the reflects off of Cross’ eyeball as
he processes,,the shot… a quick adjustment to the gun and a slight pull
of the trigger…</p>
<p><strong>boom…</strong>: We follow the arcing bullet back over the
rooftops in an instant. Somehow it keeps it’s elevation and it’s path…
.to the resigned look on Mr. X’s face: an outsmarted man, a dead man.
The bullet hits him square in the chest, and he falls to his knees, then
slumps over, dead. Flies start to gather as he lies there. First one,
then two, then several as night TIME-DISSOLVES to day…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It was a set-up all the way? Sloan just nods.
He then stoops down, shoos some of the flies away with the back of his
hand and picks up the file that Puja gave Mr. X. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on
the back of Sloan’s hand as he reads the file. It, too, has the tattoo
pf the three- headed do q, in the same spot as Mr. X.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That’s two heads in two weeks. Which leaves
only one: you. Sloan nods.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: He wants out.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: And killing all three heads gets him that?
Sloan nods again.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well, I don’t know if we have anyone who can
stop him. Sloan squints back up at Fox.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: There’s one person who can.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Yeah? Who? And with that, we…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My name is Wesley Gibson. If you look at the
corner of my desk, you’ll see the billing reports I was supposed to hand
in to Janice an hour ago. The BILLING ORT is highlighted on the screen
for just a moment. .then the movie RESUMES normal speed and Janice
reaches Wesley’s cube in no time…</p>
<p><strong>boss janice</strong>: Oh my fucking god I hope that’s not my
billing report sitting on your fucking desk. Holy shit on an altar, it
isl A couple of the other OFFICE WORKERS look up at the fireworks and
smile… like they’re actually enjoying Janice’s histrionics.</p>
<p><strong>boss janice</strong>: why don’t you just take a dump in your
hands, fork it over to me and say, “this is the best effort I’m gonna
give to you, Janice. This is the best you’re ever gonna get out of me.”
Hell, Rochelle on her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than your lazy
ass and she’s already left for the day. Je-sus CHRIST! Wesley looks like
he’d rather be anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I meant to…</p>
<p><strong>boss janice</strong>: I meant to… I meant to… Well I meant to
be a size four but meaning to doesn’t pick no cotton.</p>
<p><strong>boss janice</strong>: Tell you what. I’ll just input the
four- ones myself.</p>
<p>****: Look everyone, I’m gonna do Wesley’s four- ones for him! I
don’t have enough to do with my own damn job so I’ll do Wesley’s too!
Wesley grabs the report back.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>boss janice</strong>: Minimum for the maximum. That’s all you
ever do. The minimum you can do to suck the maximum from this
company.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I said I’ll get it done. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>boss janice</strong>: No, you’re worthless. I’m the one who’s
sorry I hired you. She storms away, fuming. Wesley looks over and sees
some of the other workers still staring at him, amused. He sits back
down to the semi-privacy of his little cubicle.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My job title is Account Manager. I used to
be called an Account Service Representative, but a consultant told us we
needed to “manage” our clients and not ” service- them. Onemore “life
sucks then you die.”</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage
nor service.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Her name’s Cathy. She works at Banana
Republic. The guy she’s humping is my best friend, Barry. She’s giving
it her best. As her MOANS reach a crescendo, we…</p>
<p>****: Yes. Uh… Well the 602 deals with applications sent by
prospective clients and the 603 is when the client is… Everyone is still
just staring…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m sorry, Jesus… uh… what was the
question?</p>
<p><strong>consultant</strong>: I asked you about the effects of net
investment income with regards to underwriting cycles.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Well, that’s the thing.-</p>
<p><strong>consultant</strong>: What’s the thing?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide cycles
differ from our firm’s cycles so I think it’s amistake to apply…</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Good God a’mighty.</p>
<p><strong>consultant</strong>: Son… everyone knows that net investment
income is inversely related to both premium and loss reserves, making
firm cycles inherently dependent on industry cycles! Everyone
snickers.</p>
<p><strong>consultant</strong>: In fact, to prove my point, I’d like you
to spend some time this afternoon adding up the yearly differential
responses.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Get it to me by five.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Sure. Wesley jots down on his pad: “ACTION
ITEMS,” and underneath it: “Differential responses… then you die.” He
underlines it three times.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: There are people, everyday you meet them,
who you wish could see you in a different setting, a different place…
Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and starts fishing
through the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .instead of where you are, what you’ve
become. Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at his
table. Nicole turns and smiles at Wesley, starts to head his way,
when…</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth at other table</strong>: Nicole! Get your ass over
here and.tell us what the hell is going on with you and Whitcock the big
cock! He pulls a chair over from next to Wesley to make room for her at
his table. Wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: And you wish to god your eyeballs weren’t
being sucked out of their sockets by monitor fatigue. That you didn’t
spend five years in college to do goddamn differential responses. see
that he is actually i&gt;laying solitaire on the computer. He keeps
checking over his shoulder for Janice, but she is talking on the phone
in her office with the door shut. He looks up and watches the computer
clock turn from 4:59 to 5:00. He saves his solitaire game and then turns
off the computer, snatches up his jacket, waits for Janice to turn her
back to him as she is engrossed in her call, and then sneaks away.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: C’mon, c’mon. After an eternity, the doors
open.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But at least at the end. of the day… Wesley
steps in and turns around. Before the doors close, he sees his boss
Janice down the hall, looking at him. She checks her watch and looks
back at him, pissed…</p>
<p>****: .you know that tomorrow it’s going to start all over again.
..and then the doors close.</p>
<p><strong>in . wesley’s apartment - dusk</strong>: Wesley enters,
toting his bike, only to find Cathy and Barry laughing on the couch,
watching some crap on television. He’s two steps in the door when…</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Where’s the spaghetti?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: I specifically told you to get noodles on
your way home. God, Wesley, I already put the sauce on.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Sorry. I•didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: You didn’t listen is what you didn’t.- I
might as well talk to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’ll be right back. He turns around.</p>
<p>****: You want me to go with you, buddy? What a dick. Wesley doesn’t
turn around, defeated…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My parents both died when I was born. He
grits his teeth as we…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: The nutjobs I had as foster parents thought
any book that didn’t contain a red-letter edition was the spawn of the
devil…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: ..so I had to hide my stash like it was a
bag of many jane. Stuck in a hole is a copy of THE COUNT OF MONTE
CRISTO. He moves back around the corner and standing there is his FOSTER
MOTHER, pissed as hell…</p>
<p><strong>wesley ,</strong>: One time my foster mother found my copy of
CATCHER IN THE RYE… .she holds a copy of the book in,her hand, getting
ready, to strike..</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .and God told her to beat me with it. Young
Wesley takes a beating, WHAP, WHAP, WRAP! .his face screws up, taking
the blows…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .But despite them, I thought I was gonna be
something special.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: There is a remedy for all things but death. She
said it so fast he’s not sure he heard it right. He turns and sees
the-hottest zQZM ever to ace Kroger’s aisles: ox. She’s wearing barely
enough clothing to cover her tight body.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You apologize too much.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Sorry? She looks him in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Spina bifida babies have more backbone than
you. With that, she walks toward the end of the aisle, eyes scanning the
whole time. Stunned, all Wesley can do is watch her walk. on the sMll f
her back is a tatt It’ tattoo we saw in the be i n n : a thKee-head2d
dog. She gets to the end and catches him looking at her. Then she makes
a very subtle gesture with her head… as if to say “come here.” Wesley
still isn’t sure what the hell is going on. Sheepishly, he makes his way
to where she stands. She leans in close, her lips just inches from his
ear.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I knew your father. Whatever Wesley was
expecting_ it wasn’t that. He pulls back from her.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I think you got the wrong guy.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Can’t say that I agree with you, Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What is this? How d’you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your father…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My father died in a car wreck the week I was
born…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: ,Your father died two days ago on the rooftop.
of the Metropolitan Building. For a moment, just a moment, Wesley is
stunned, but Fox just keeps sizing him up.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: He’d be damn disappointed in what you’ve
become, too. Wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Lady…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ve been called a lot of things, but “lady”
ain’t one of ’em. Wesley starts to talk but Fox interrupts him…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Damn, Wesley, how d’you ever learn anything
when you won’t keep your mouth shut and your ears open? I’m trying to
tell you about your father. Wesley starts to open his mouth again, but
then closes it. He waits.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your father, Wesley, wits the great„ sit
assassin to ever live. Your father, Wesley, worked for the
Fraternity.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: The Fraternity?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your father, Wesley, was set up and gunned down
by a man he used to consider a friend. And your father, Wesley…
Suddenly, s raises her hands and-LS fist’ two blgck</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: .taught me everything I know. Wesley takes a
step back.</p>
<p>****: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: This is what you’ve dreamt about all your life.
Just then, Cross o s the corner to t e’ e also fisting a Da’r of alms.
Wesley’s eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing, BAM!</p>
<p><strong>bami bamz bami bam</strong>: forcing Cross to take cover on
the far side of the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Move! Now! She screams this, grabbing Wesley’s
wrist and jerking him forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a
killing machine. They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle
explodes in an avalanche of bullets! Glass bottles of spaghetti sauce
shatter, turning the aisle into a rainstorm of red droplets – we’re not
sure what is sauce and what is blood. Then… Cross springs on to a
display stand of tortillas and up to the top of the freezer section, so
he can have a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley. He
starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section, smashing over
styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely miss Fox and Wesley, but slam
into the freezers behind them, sending ice and glass exploding
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Drive!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What?!! But Fox just leaps into the
passenger seat, guns up and ready, as Wesley’s legs. somehow take over
and he hops behind the wheel. Just then, Cross’s ev ll Mound the corner,
practically going up on two tires. Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope
the clutch, and smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck
when it launches forward. He races through the gears and rips around a
corner and out into traffic.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Just drive! The Chevelle stays on his tail
behind them; Cross drives and fires his Glock at the same time. Bam!
Bam! Sam! Fox does her best to send bullets back his way, while Wesley
mans the wheel, breathing hard, still stunned at what is happening. He
spots a side-street…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Hold on! …whips the car into a
rubber-squealing turn…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Truck!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Go around it!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No! Shoot the tires! Fox looks at Wesley,
momentarily stunned by his idea, then spins and fires away at the
oncoming truck. The front tires on the truck explode and the truck veers
hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk.,,, hat sends it into a
violent roll. Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips
forward… right over their car!!! Wesley watches it fly over them, amazed
his idea worked… when finally it SMASHES down into the street between
them and Cross’s Chevellel Cross is forced to slam on his brakes and
slide out… but it’s too late… his Chevelle smashes into the 4 X 4 before
skidding to a stop, a tangled mess in the street. Wesley snaps back to
reality and rips the Ferrari off the one-way street and down a side
street.</p>
<p>****: There’s a lot of things you don’t know about yourself,
Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That… was the man who killed your father. And
now he’s trying to kill you. Wesley forces a laugh, but right now it’s
hard to paint any-thing as ludicrous.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No. I mean… I told you my father died when I
was a baby. She leans right into his face so that their noses are only
inches apart.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Have you ever believed that? Have you ever been
content with that answer? Wesley stops, not sure of anything right
now.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Today’s your new birthday, Wesley. Drive. He
settles back in his seat and pops the clutch again, this time, easing.a
little more respectably into traffic.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: The people I work with… we believe your father
passed his skills on genetically to you. You knew how to handle the car,
you knew to shoot at the truck.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It’s that confidence we’re gonna need to work
on. Wesley is still dazed.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Now I want you to look at me and tell me
something. And I want you to be honest with me.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Do you think I look fat in this outfit?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I thought so. Let’s go. She hops out. They walk
inside a…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Mr. Sloan. The Butcher looks up from his work
and lays down the knife, right next to where Mr. Sloan has a pair of
silver pistols and a magnifying glass resting on a rolling table.</p>
<p>****: This is Wesley Gibson. He needs his life changed. The Butcher
looks him over.</p>
<p><strong>the butcher</strong>: We all end up where we belong, don’t
we? The Butcher snickers. Sloan speaks up…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Fox told you about your father? Wesley looks
from Sloan to Fox to the Butcher and back to Sloan.</p>
<p>****: Like I told… um… the lady here… I think you might ha ve me
mixed up with someone else. I’m just an… um… account serv… uh..that is…
account manager… and… my father died… He hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: When? They look at him, imploringly, waiting
for an answer.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I… I guess I’m not sure. Sloan simply picks
up one of the pistols and sticks the gun in Wesley’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Shoot the wings off the flies.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What?!</p>
<p>****: Shoot… the wings… off the flies. For. the first time, Wesley
notices flies buzzing all around.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I don’t… In the blink of an eye, Sloan has
plucked the second gun off the rolling table and ’,s -pointing it at
Weslev’s temple. He begins to count…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You have three seconds. Three… two… Before he
can say one, Wesley reacts… blindly firing the pistol in his hand,
indiscriminately, B,AM! BAM! BAM! BAM! CLICK…CLICK…CLICK… until his
finger is just jamming on the trigger over and over. After a moment, he
looks up, unsure why he isn’t dead.</p>
<p><strong>through the magnifying glass:</strong>: Four flies lie on -
the floor. crawling o d… their wings actually separated from their
bodies!</p>
<p><strong>in the slaughterhouse:</strong>: Wesley jerks upright, trying
to process this.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Like I said, you got the skills.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: And after we fine tune those skills… His eyes
lock on to Wesley’s, holding them in a vice-like grip…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: .you’re going to hunt the man who killed Your
father. Wesley is as stunned as we’ve ever seen him… he blinks a couple
of times.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Walk with me. He drapes his arm around Wesley
and leads him out the door.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I know thin is hard for you to understand,
Wesley, but I want you to concentrate on what I’m saying. Your father
was a member of the Fraternity, a collection of the most powerful
assassins the world has ever known. They weave against the flow of
pedestrians out and about on the city streets. Instinctively, people
step out of their way.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But I’ve never heard of…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We don’t advertise Wesley. We blend into the
environment like moths against a tree.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We stay in the shadows. .. to the kitchen,
where a massive man with a three- headed dog tattoo on his hand, flips
burgers. THE CHEF.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We disappear into our surroundings. .until it
finds a man with a three-headed dog tattoo on his hand, trimming a
hedge. THE GARDENER.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Because the easiest place to hide is in plain
sight… .until it finds a GUN SALESMAN holding out a weapon to an Italian
customer. He also has the tattoo. He’s THE</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: ..until that time when we are called into
action.</p>
<p><strong>a,</strong>: he’s cutting a hole all the way through the
hedge. Then, he reaches down into his burlap sack and withdraws a long
range rifle with a scope. He pokes the rifle through the freshly-cut
hole, looks through the lens, starts to squeeze his trigger… The CAMERA
SHOOTS WAY UP to give us an aerial view of the neighborhood. We see that
we are in the hills over the city, and across the canyon, a Japanese man
is just pulling into his driveway, driving a black Audi, a mile away. He
brakes his car, opens his door, but THWAPI A bullet disintegrates his
head and he topples over, never knowing what hit him. Back at the hole
in the hedge, we see the Gardener’s eyeball looking through from the
other side… until it disappears and he is gone.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: And when the time comes that we are called,
death is as certain as the sun.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We have been active for centuries, Wesley…
outlasting rulers, governments, nations, kings. We recognize no borders;
the entire globe is our killing field. They are buzzed through by THE
PHARMACIST, and enter…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We are the baddest of the bad, the three-
headed dog that guards the gates of hell. We show no mercy, we destroy
the weak, we have absolute power.</p>
<p>****: But recently, a fallen angel, one of our own, has challenged
that power. The screens in the room come to life with the face of
Cross.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: This man left the Fraternity and decided to
strike down those who had befriended him, trained him, made him who he
is.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: ..a son whose mother died in childbirth… They
reach the baby’s bed and a pair of strong arms lift up the child. But
the CAMERA FINDS the face of the second man…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: ..he took the boy to an orphanage so his true
identity would never be discovered. .and now we see that the other man
is a YOUNG MR.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: And I helped him.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Why would you do that? Sloan puts a hand on
Wesley’s shoulder, gently. Paternally.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Your father was like a brother to me.</p>
<p>****: I will do anything to avenge his death.’ Sloan turns off the
monitors and pulls over a wooden chair from where it rests by a
wall.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: So Wesley… you have a choice. Would you like
to go back to your job, your girlfriend, your life, just as it was
before?</p>
<p>****: Or would you like to begin your training with an assassin’s
Fraternity that writes the world’s history in blood and bullets? Wesley
doesn’t know what to say. Sloan moves to a back door .</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: If the answer is the latter, then have a seat
in that chair.</p>
<p>****: If not, you’re welcome to head out this door here and we’ll
never see each other again. With that., Sloan leaves through that back
door. But…</p>
<p><strong>on the other side of the door:</strong>: He stops. He pulls
out a gun and waits for Wesley to make his decision, pointing his gun at
the door.</p>
<p><strong>back in the room:</strong>: Wesley is still standing there,
unaware of what is on the other side of the door, thinking, thinking,
thinking. He takes a step toward the door…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: His boss Janice, yelling at him, mocking him.
Wesley hesitates, looks at the chair, then the door again…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: His girlfriend on the couch, riding high on
Barry, loving every minute of it. Wesley stands frozen, staring hard at
the chair as THE CAMERA STARTS to swirl around him.</p>
<p><strong>flashes</strong>: The consultant haranguing, the other
employees laughing, eating.alone in the break room, riding his bike, all
the aspects of his shitty life… .. as the CAMERA CONTINUES to swirl
around him, his face going hard…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fuck consultants and fuck action items and
fuck differential responses. Fuck it all. He takes a seat in the chair,
which creaks when he sits in it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fuck it all.</p>
<p><strong>on the other side of the back door:</strong>: Sloan hears the
creak of the chair and lowers his gun. He smiles and walks off down an
alley.</p>
<p><strong>in the room:</strong>: Wesley waits in the chair for what
seems an eternity. starts to bite his thumbnail, nervously. In comes the
Pharmacist. The man is built like a mountain, with muscles rippling out
of his white smock. .He’s got a British accent and is extremely
polite.</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: ’Ah, made your choice, did ’ja, of
boy?</p>
<p>****: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: Very good, very good. He walks
behind Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: The weather’s been lovely the last
couple o’ days– would you mind putting your hands back here for me?
Wesley does, and the Pharmacist binds his hands with some rope.</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: There, that’s it. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Is this the beginning of my training?</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: Quite right. The Pharmacist cracks
his knuckles and then, WHAM!!! He hits Wesley so hard right in the cheek
that it almost knocks him out of the chair.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What the fuck are… WHANIlM 4!!!1 The
Pharmacist smashes him again. Wesley struggles against the ropes but
isn’t going anywhere. The Pharmacist rears back. and WHAM! WHAMMM!
WHAMQ! keeps hitting him over-and over again until Wesley’s eyes roll to
the back of his head.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You know how when you have a dream and wake
up unexpectedly…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: …and the dream is still. on the fringe of
your brain but you can’t quite remember the details? He looks up at his
ceiling fan, barely turning, a few blades missing…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But then you see that same old busted
ceiling fan over your bed and you are so damn glad it was just a dream?
He sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror. His face has
been pummeled; it looks like a piece of squashed fruit.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: This was nothing like that.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What happened to your face? Wesley turns in
his chair, surprised. Nicole stands there, looking as pretty as ever,
way out of -his league.</p>
<p>****: I… uh…I got hit by a man much bigger than me. Nicole smiles,
flirtatiously.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Was this over a girl?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I had no idea you had such a secret life
outside of here. She cocks her head and studies him.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Is there something different about you?
Besides the… face?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No. Not really. Same old Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I don’t think so. She puts her hand on top
of his; he can only stare at it… this kind of thing just doesn’t happen
to him.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You aren’t like these people Wesley. I’ve
always thought you were different.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Would you consider me to be an observant
person?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What’s that mean? Wesley’s about to say
something, when he spots Janice heading their way. Wesley nods at her
and Nicole frowns.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Uh-oh, here comes the wicked bitch of the
west… With that, she steps away, just as Janice walks up. Wesley stands
to face his boss, as Janice launches into him…</p>
<p><strong>boss janice</strong>: Jesus H. Fucking Popscile, you don’t
have time to get me the differential responses but you got time to
chitty-chatty with the intern? Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?
Well I know one thing, your review is coming up next week and I can’t
wait to start checking me off some boxes… attitude: poor, performance:
poor, management skills: poor, works well with others… Wesley just
focuses on that mouth. Fat lips over fat gums over yellow teeth. But now
all that’s coming out of it is JIBBERISH. ’ I Jibberish that goes
straight from her larynx to Wesley’s ears where it imbeds in the soft
flesh of his brain and BURNS… It’s so goddamn loudl if only… …if only it
would just…</p>
<p><strong>shut the fuck up11!!1111</strong>: It’s so unbelievably
stunning coming out of Wesley’s mouth that it hits Janice like a slap in
the face. Heads all over the office start to poke out of the tops of
their cubicles like gophers coming out of holes. Nicole watches,
pleasantly stunned, from a few feet away. Janice looks around, shocked.
Wesley likes the way that felt, so…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Just because you have one single iota of
tenuous power, you think you can push everyone around?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .I understand, Janice, that junior high must
have been particularly difficult being called Tubby all the time, but
that doesn’t give you the goddamn right to treat your workers like
horseshit. Sure we laugh at you behind your back and sure we know you
keep a stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk… Janice
looks down at her fingers, which still have a little grape jelly on
them…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .and sure everyone takes their lunch an hour
before you so we can get an extra hour away from you, and I know that
must sting sitting by yourself in the White Castle parking lot every day
gnawing on your third burger thinking up ways to humiliate us… Janice’s
eyes fall to her feet.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .you know, if you weren’t such a bitch, we
might actually feel sorry for you. As it is, I feel I can speak for the
rest of the office when I say… FUCK YOU!!! With that, he throws all the
papers off his desk, sending them flying! Empowered, Wesley marches
toward the elevators as everyone watches him go, admiration plastered on
their faces. The loudmouth from the break-room steps out…</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth</strong>: That was great dude! He holds up his hand
for a high-five, but Wesley just WALLOPS him with a right cross, not
breaking stride on his way to the elevators.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s up, new man?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You were watching?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Never stopped. How’d it feel, saying exactly
what you wanted to say?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Like I had a gun in my hands. Fox grins as
Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on the pedal. The Diablo’s tires
smoke as she launches it out of there.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You need to get used to the blood and the
muscle and the meat and the sinew and what a single blade of steel can
do to a chunk of flesh. The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of
tenderloin off of one of the hanging carcasses, then slaps it on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Take care of him, Butcher.</p>
<p><strong>the butcher</strong>: Will do, Fox. The Butcher measures
Wesley, then starts to talk in a steady, almost bored voice…</p>
<p><strong>the butcher</strong>: Remember, it’s the body we are killing.
Know it like a surgeon. Wesley nods, half disgusted, half
enthralled.</p>
<p><strong>the butcher</strong>: Okay, we’ll start at the beginning. To
cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-pick style and thrust down
behind the clavicle, cutting side to side. He jabs the blade into the
beef… and just as he does…</p>
<p><strong>flash - parking garage:</strong>: .we smash cut to a
BUSINESSMAN walking to his car just as the Butcher comes up behind him
and performs the exact same move he was just demonstrating. Just as
quickly, we…</p>
<p><strong>flash - back to the slaughterhouse:</strong>: .and the
Butcher performs the next move…</p>
<p><strong>the butcher -</strong>: To slice the diaphragm, first whip
your wrist into the target’s trachea to prevent screaming, then drive
the knife at a forty-five degree angle upward just below the rib cage.
Just as the knife hits the side of beef, we smash cut to…</p>
<p><strong>flash - luxury hotel suite:</strong>: . a DRUG KINGPIN coming
out of his hotel bathroom wearing a bathrobe. Suddenly the Butcher is on
him, performing what he just described on this poor bastard, who can no
longer scream because he’s missing his trachea, and just as quickly…</p>
<p><strong>flash - back to the slaughterhouse:</strong>: .we are right
back to the hanging side of beef as the Butcher performs the next
move…</p>
<p><strong>the butcher</strong>: If you want the jugular, pull your
enemy’s head to the left and jab your knife well into his sterno-cleio-
mastoideus muscle, here, then cut down and left. Just like before, we
smash cut to…</p>
<p><strong>flash - dirty alley:</strong>: …a MAN moseying down an alley,
carrying a briefcase, when suddenly, the Butcher comes out of nowhere,
pulls the enemy’s head to the left and then WHAM!, jabs the knife into
the neck, matching the move-he was just demonstrating.</p>
<p><strong>7 flash - hack to the slaughterhouse:</strong>: The butcher
continues to hack away at the hanging meat, describing more and more
ways to kill with a blade…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: They never show you this shit on the
McDonald’s commercials. .. as the CAMERA FINDS Wesley, who is completely
absorbed in the lesson. The Butcher hands him the knife, and Wesley
starts to make his first chops at it, wanting to please the Butcher,
wanting to get it right…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You haven’t quite figured out this whole
“blending in” thing, yet. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: This… She picks the lock and they step
inside…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: This is the Roach Motel, Wesley. Wesley looks
around, disgusted.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: All right, find us some skinny bitches. Wesley
uncovers the first body… it’s a. black male.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Nahh, let the brother rest. Find us some white
meat. And nothing too fat. Wesley covers the black male and moves over
to a second body. He unveils it to reveal… what looks like a dead
suburban housewife.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Perfect. Load up soccer mom.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Selecting your weapon and then disposing of
it is the most pivotal aspect of every assassination. An array of
firearms are on a shelf next to Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Pick one. Wesley eyes all the weaponry.
Finally, he settles on a short-barreled black handgun. Sloan takes it
from him and inspects it.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It holds
seventeen bullets in the clip and one in the chamber. It’s made of a
composite material unrecognizable by metal detectors.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: And the Imanishi’s bullets have microchips
that communicate with similar ones in the gun.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Computer chips?</p>
<p>****: Sometimes the closest distance between two points is not a
straight line. What if soccer mom here is between you and your
target?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I suppose you’re going to tell me to shoot
her first.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: How’d you do in Physics class?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Mostly B’s. Fox cocks her head at Wesley,
knows he’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Okay, I got a D.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I couldn’t remember all the rules –</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’s it. Rules. What if I told you there
weren’t any? He nods at Wesley, like he’s on to something.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: People live by the rules set before them. We
take them on faith that they are right. But how many times in your life
have you thought you had a better way, against-the rules that was simply
laughed at.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Every day.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Because you use your brain differently than
other people. All Fraternity members do.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Humans use neurons to think. But most people
can only handle a small percentage of those neurons firing at once
without suffering a seizure or an aneurism. Not us. And not you. We have
the ability to think differently than other people.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: So we set our own rules.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’s right. Sloan hands him back the
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Try it. Wesley aims the pistol at the target
in front of him. He</p>
<p><strong>fires…</strong>: ..and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Have you ever shot a gun before?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Just the flies.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: So you have no pre-conceived habits we need
to break. Shoot the target. Don’t hit mom.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You mean curve the bullet? How?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: This isn’t about “how.” It’s about “what.” If
you’d never been told a bullet flies straight and I handed you this and
said hit that target… what would you do? Allow your instincts to guide
you. Just like the flies.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The technology is only here to assist your
natural instinct. Wesley lifts the gun, his mind racing…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: It’s not ‘will’ that makes the physical react
how we wish, it’s ‘control.’ You are in control…</p>
<p><strong>bam bam bam!</strong>: The bullets blast out of the gun, like
they are on a track set up by Wesley’s brain. He flicks his wrists and…
.they arc qUickly, Just missing the body i e th2 center of the target!
Sloan smiles.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Rules are made to be broken, Wesley. No one
was better at that than your father. He had a pair of pearl-handled
revolvers with which he could conduct a symphony. L i Wesley nods
proudly, and squeezes off some more shots, all chasing through the same
hole in the target.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Oh my god, Wesley, where have you been? I’ve
been so worried! But Wesley just pushes past her and starts to throw
clothes out of drawers into a black duffel bag.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: What’re you doing? Are you leaving? You .owe
rent! But Wesley just keeps packing.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: You can’t leave! This is bullshit, Wesley.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Who the fuck are you? But Fox doesn’t even
acknowledge her presence, and just watches Wesley do his business.
Wesley walks out the door and Fox follows. Cathy chases them out on to
the landing…</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: You’re nothing, Wesley! And you will always
be nothing! You think you’re gonna be happy.with that skank… Uh-oh… Fox
stops and turns around – fisting her pistols. She unloads… BAM! BAM!
BAM! BAM! BAM! The CAMERA SWINGS OVER TO CATHY, who is about to pies
herself, standing in the door frame, with bullet holes placed expertly
around her head. Wesley and Fox keep moving, down the steps. Barry is
coming up the steps, but he takes one look at them, does a U-turn and
hurries out of their path.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You can take the couch until we find you
someplace better.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Okay. She moves toward a separate
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fox? She stops.</p>
<p><strong>c wesley</strong>: What was my father like? For a moment, she
thinks about it. Then…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your father lov ed you, Wesley. He talked about
you all the time.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Really? Wesley looks at her hopefully. She
smiles, thinking about the past.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That’s a fact. He knew he wasn’t supposed to,
but he couldn’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You worked with him?</p>
<p>****: He trained me. Made me what I am.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I remember one night he had me on my own .for
the first time, and I was tagging this target named Buster Burgess. But
I was green and clumsy and stupid. Buster marked me and disappeared into
this old tenement building.</p>
<p><strong>bam!</strong>: He nails Fox in the thigh, and she falls
helpless to the pavement.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Motherfucker shot mein the leg. Put a damn hole
in my favorite skirt. The figure re-aims, ready to take out the helpless
Fox.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Then you know what happened?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My father saved your life? Put a bullet in
Burgess? k,</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Naww. I ended up with four more slugs in me.
The figure unleashes four more shots.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What kind of training is that?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m here, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>inside the lobby:</strong>: Wesley weighs all this, puts it
together.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My father was Burgess, wasn’t he? Fox nods,
smiling. They step…</p>
<p><strong>inside an elevator:</strong>: .andstart riding it up.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: He didn’t hit me anywhere important, and he
used pin-shot bullets that didn’t do any real damage. But you can be
damn sure I don’t let any mark get the high ground on me again.
Shesmiles at another thought.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: And you know what we did instead of go to the
hospital to stitch me up?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We went driving.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: This is where your father was killed. Wesley’s
eyes narrow and he looks around, taking it all in.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’re not sure. The fence he was meeting was
shot in the head… which led him out to here… but it must’ve been a
set-up all along. All I know is it would take a hell of a trap to bring
your father down. Wesley crouches down by where his father’s body would
have been, running his fingers over the gravel rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My whole life I thought he was dead. I
shouldn’t feel any differently just because it happened 20 years
later.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But, I do. Like I missed my one chance.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well that’s why you’re here. To make up for
lost time. Wesley looks back at her.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Can I see his body?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We cremate our dead. I’d like to say it’s to
honor them, but it’s mainly to keep anyone from identifying them after
they’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: These are my father’s ashes?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Sloan said his heart stopped but there was
no entry wound?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Can I have a minute?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Sure. She leaves and Wesley approaches the urn
holding his father’s’remains. He runs his finger over it, and just when
we think he’s going to have an emotional moment…’ ..he smashes the urn
on to the stand, the ashes spilling out everywhere. Wesley runs his
fingers through the decay: what a mess… there are pieces of bone
intermingled in the cremains. But then hisfingegs find something in the
dust… a BULLET with a hole running down its center. He holds it up to
the light for a closer look. As he studies it, we start to hear… WHAM!
WHAMI…</p>
<p><strong>wham! wham! wham!</strong>: Wesley site with his hands tied
behind his back, taking another beating from The Pharmacist, who spouts
assassination techniques while he pummels Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on
one and find yourself the one, remember that each foe will likely move
at the same steady speed away from each other, allowing you to keep a
gun on each.</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: Now, if you find yourself one ’ on
three, that poses a real bit a’ ball ache…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: There are two kinds of pain. One is an
object. A living thing that crawls around the outside of your body.
Cuts, broken bones, bruises… all deliver the kind of pain you can learn
to ignore, and they soon disappear to nothing but the sound of a gnat in
your ear. Wesley’s eyes are starting to lose consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’ve lived with a different kind of pain all
my life… the kind that comes from two decades of being passed over,
pushed around, ignored. But you can’t hide from that kind of pain
either… Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: .because it finds you. He involuntarily
spite blood as his eyes roll back in his head.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Watch the eyes. Look for a slight swelling of
the pupil. You can train your body to stay a constant temperature, you
can control your heartbeat, but you can’t control the center of your
eyes. That’s how you know when someone is lying to you. Sloan looks
right at him. Wesley narrows his eyes, trying to fend off his stare.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Do you want to fuck Fox?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I know that’s a lie without even seeing your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fine. Try something else.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Okay. What are you hiding from me? Wesley
looks down, then focuses on Sloan.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Nothing. Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it’s
useless to try to keep something from this man. He reaches into his
pocket and pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center… places it
on the table.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You told me to hunt down my father’s killer.
That’s what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: The bullet that killed him. You said his
heart stopped but there was no entrance wound. This bullet has a hole
cut into its center…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You know how a mole buries into the earth by
pushing the dirt back around it? I think this bullet does what the mole
does… Splits the skin and pushes it back through its center, filling the
space it just passed through. Sloan looks at him, like he might have
been underestimating him until now.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fox was telling me that my father used
special bullets. It looks like Cross does too… which means these are
custom made. If we find who makes them, then we find someone who has
access to Cross.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You put this all together on your own? Wesley
taps his head.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Firing neurons.</p>
<p>****: Whatever happened to my father’s guns? The pearl handled
ones?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Don’t know. But whoever has them isn’t long
for this place. Sloan reaches down and picks up a binder which he drops
on the desk.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Cross. The details of his life. q Continue
your hunt.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No rules, right? This stops Sloan for a
second.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: No rules.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom:</strong>: Fox peers out the door and looks
at Wesley, watching him absorb more of Cross with every page.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We keep a record of every assassination
mission, going back to the Ides of March. Maps, diagrams, logistics,
complications, weapons of choice… it’s all there. Wesley nods,
impressed. Sloan just keeps leading him through a set of double doors,
into…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Where we plot our local hits. This city is
one of the Fraternity’s major headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: This room. The books. Seems low-tech.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Part of mastering technology is knowing when
to use it. Models can’t be hacked. Your father built this room himself.
Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst them are a few
vainted red. Some of the model street lamps are also red.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What’s with the red ones? Sloan just smiles…
.and THE CAMERA MOVES TO HIS FEET, then PUSHES’IN on one particular
street on the map, further in on one RED STREETLIGHT and we…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The Fraternity’s grasp reaches every facet of
the world’s major cities, including their construction. Look at this
streetlight. Wesley peers at it… there is a plaque affixed to the pole…
the standard thing you find on these things… “Municipal C. W. 63070.”
But then there is something different on this one… a tiny symbol on the
bottom of the plaque… the Cerberus instead of the seal of the cit Sloan
presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside, revealing a hollow space
behind it. He reaches his hand inside and pulls out a small handgun…
flips out the clip expertly, then racks the weapon. Wesley can’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You have stashes…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: .everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Sir… Sloan flashes his tattoo at
them.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Keep moving, fellas. They nod and do just
that.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: They let us do our jobs, we let them live.
THE CAMERA PUSHES IN on Wesley’s face as he realizes the full scope of
this organization and we…</p>
<p><strong>series of shots:</strong>: GUN RANGE. Wesley firing his
Imanishi 18 on the shooting range, steering the bullets wherever he
wants them to go.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Closer. Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the
corpse closer to the target, making the angle all that much tougher.
Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol starts FIRING
next to him. He looks over… Sloan is standing nr= &amp;o him, firing at
the target. Every shot bends around the body and hits right in the
forehead of the target. Wesley smiles, impressed. LIBRARY. Wesley thumbs
through an old Fraternity book, which has detailed sketches of an
assassination in 17th century Paris. MEAT LOCKER. Wesley working out on
a heavy bag, honing his punches, the Chef holding the bag for him,
muscles rippling. MAP ROOM. Wesley walks by himself amongst the
miniature city, trying to memorize where the red marks are.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Our job isn’t just about how fast or true you
shoot, Wesley. Physical agility will always lose to mental agility. It’s
warfare of the mind. FO ’S APART. Wesley looking at Fox through the
bedroom door. SLAUGHTERHOUSE. Wesley working with the Butcher on the art
of knife play. MAP ROOM. The Gardener and Fox show Wesley the rooftop of
a certain building on the model city, one corner of the roof painted
red. ROOFTOP. Fox and the Gardener now with Wesley on that actual
rooftop, pointing out firing angles, modes. of ascension, and escape
routes. The Gardener moves over to a cornerstone in the roof of the
building and then easily lifts it off, revealing a stash of assault
rifles. k SHOOTING G . Wesley looking at some ammunition while the
Gunsmith talks and demonstrates. He fires at one of the targets, which
EXPLODES in a splattered mess and we cut to…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Cross and my father were tight. But Cross
thought he should be one of the heads of the Fraternity so he left and
vowed to kill the three heads. Which means my father is dead because of
petty jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: More reason for Cross to die. Wesley flips to
the picture of cross.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But I don’t see jealousy in those eyes, do
you? Fox walks over and slams the binder shut.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Listen .to me, Wesley. In two weeks, we have to
kill Henry Helms. Do-you know who that is?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: The journalist who’s got a price-tag on his
head.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: A price-tag that we’re going to collect. Your
father was meeting with a fence about the job when Cross took him down.
So we can only assume Cross knows about the target too. We… you… have to
take Cross out before we prosecute this mission. We can’t have him out
there as a wildcard, wreaking havoc, do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’ve never defaulted on a job and this 1k one
won’t be the first.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: May have found your match, Sloan. Sloan smirks
and turns to instruct Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Pick the weapon, make the kill, destroy the
weapon. No other rules. Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Close the gap. Push the body closer to the
target..</p>
<p><strong>the gunsmith</strong>: It’s already at four feet.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Closer.</p>
<p><strong>the gunsmith</strong>: Here’s two. Your father couldn’t even
do that.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Closer.</p>
<p><strong>the gunsmith</strong>: Wesley, at some point –</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Closer. I’ll say when.</p>
<p><strong>wn</strong>: Gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the
body, until it’s actually touching the back of the dead business
man!</p>
<p><strong>the gunsmith</strong>: How you gonna – ?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Just run it out there. Let the kid work. The
Gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range. Wesley looks at
Sloan.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You wanna go first?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: There are limits to everything, Wesley. At
some point the body becomes a shield. Wesley pulls his gun and lets
loose five rounds, lightning fast. The Gunsmith brings the target back
to them… ..a the business man is riddled with es.</p>
<p><strong>the gunsmith</strong>: I guess not every rule can be
broken.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Check the target. The Gunsmith does and we
see that each of the five bullets has passed clean through the cadaver
and found it’s mark on the target.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You’ll find one entry below the shoulder,
missing the major blood vessels there, exiting the back. Second shot
went through the abdomen, clipped only the bowel and exited cleanly.
Third hit the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, which is partially
protected by the ribcage, and passed through the liver and probably part
of the gallbladder. Upper left abdomen is a good place, where number
four ruptured the spleen before continuing down main street. And
finally, what I like to call “the ,7FK.” Number five entered the mouth,
was redirected downward by the upper jawbone ON, and exited the back of
the neck. That’s the shot you’ll find in the middle of the target.
Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the
target.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fuck the rules. With that, he turns and
walks away, a look on his face that is his fiercest, a far cry from the
kid in the cubicle. That same expression is on his face as we…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: One! There is a look in Wesley’s eye we,
haven’t seen before, a burning, searing fire. As he continues to take
punches and count them out…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Two! Three! Four!</p>
<p><strong>five!!</strong>: ..he pulls his arms tight, and his muscles
start to twitch and bulge – muscles we didn’t know he had until. now –
and as he continues to take punches, WHAM!, WHAM!, WHAM!!, the rope
strains against the wooden chair, and we can HEAR the wooden legs start
to pop, until… CRACK!!! Wesley Jerks his arms ee and comes swillcrincr
with the broken of leg of the chair. SMASH! SMASH!! The Pharmacist goes
down hard and Wesley stands over him, out of control,. furious, SMASH!
SMASH!, beating him with that broken chair leg. The CAMERA PUSHES THOUGH
one of the walls…</p>
<p><strong>observation room:</strong>: .. to where Fox and Sloan are
watching Wesley pummel the pummeler through a one-way mirror.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: He’s ready. the los2k on Fox’s face becomes
more and more and sexual until…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Don’t you quit now, baby! Don’t you quit now!!
Wesley didn’t know it could be like this. After they finish, Fox gets up
and heads to the shower and he watches her go the whole way. In the
doorway, she turns around…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Sloan says you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Do you like being the only chick in the
Fraternity?</p>
<p>****: Who said I was the only sister? Maybe you just haven’t met any
others yet. Wesley laughs.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Maybe I have and I’m just not telling
you.</p>
<p>****: Hold still. He settles down.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: How did you end up here, Fox?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Same way you did, sugar. They found me.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What did you do before? Fox looks at him, a
wry smile on her face.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Sold perfume. At the mall.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No shit?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I can’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Get in line.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What made them come after you? I mean, I
know why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Fraternity members all have something in their
lineage that shows they’ll be good at this.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: And yours is?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: My great-great-great-grandfather on my mother’s
side. He was on a slave ship coming over from East Africa and as it was
pulling into Charleston, he killed every white man on the ship and swam
to shore. They caught him and hung him four days later.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: That’s terrible.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I Nah. Motherfucker deserved it. Be raped eight
women in those four days. One of them was my
great-great-great-grandmama. She pushes her chair back, done with her
work. The CAMERA PUSHES IN as Fox removes the device so we can take a
look: the three-headed dog has been tattooed into his hand.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Where’s the Diablo?</p>
<p>****: I got tired of the color. Wesley can’t help but smile, then Fox
stops. They’re standing right in front of a CAR SHOWROOM, displayed in
the window is a MIDNIGHT BLACK PORSCHE 911 convertible sitting in a
showroom window… ’us like the one Wesley’s father smashed in Fox’s
story.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Being a member of the Fraternity was like
winning the lottery…</p>
<p><strong>on the city streets:</strong>: Traffic lights mean nothing,
as Wesley mashes the accelerator to the mat, and the Porsche responds,
ripping up the road like a tiger on the prowl. Fox rises up in the
passenger seat, looking over the windshield, the wind whipping her
face…</p>
<p><strong>wesley.</strong>: This… this is what my dad’s life was like.
He was a fucking god. He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around
a corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler, which has to
slam on its brakes.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Where we headed?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Trial by fire, sugar. Hook a right. Wesley
whips the car around a corner…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Park it here, baby. He pulls the car to the
side of the street… .in front of a busy outdoor mall. It’s covered with
shops, eateries, movie theaters and people, people, people. Fox eyes the
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You need a new wardrobe or something?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: we’re here for a reason and it ain’t
clothes-shopping. Somewhere in that crowd is your first target.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: A test?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: The real thing.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Who’s the mark?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’ll know him when you see him.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What if I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Then you get shot. Fox hands him his Imanishi
pistol, which Wesley rolls over in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It’s graduation day, baby. I He nods and makes
his way toward…</p>
<p><strong>the outdoor mall:</strong>: .where he quickly mingles with
the crowd. He has his hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded-
sweatshirt, the pistol inside. People pass him on his left and right,
some make eye contact, some don’t… anybody could be the target..
Wesley’s eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying… the SECURITY GUARD by the
theater, the SWEATER-FOLDER at The Gap, the SCARY-LOOKING GUY shopping
at the sunglasses stand. And then Wesley’s eyes settle on someone he was
not expecting to see… Barry, his best friend that was shagging his
girlfriend… is thumbing through books outside the BARNES AND NOBLE…
seemingly. not paying attention to what’s around him. Wesley can’t
believe it. It can’t be him. Can it? Just then, Barry stops looking at
the books and starts walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down. Fuck,
this can’t really be happening…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Wesley… hey dude. Wesley can’t believe
itl</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Thanks for calling me. I wanted to say…
Wesley pulls out his gun and Barry throws up his hands…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Whoa, man!! But now we see Wesley is looking
past B_arry. over his shoulder…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Get down! .and he’s looking at a man we
recognize from his office… The Consultant. He’s approaching rapidly
behind Barry, fisting a ’pair of pistols! Just as Barry hits the deck,
Wesley pulls the trigger… .but it lust CLICKS, the chamber empty…</p>
<p><strong>the porsche:</strong>: Fox holds the clip to Wesley’s
Imanishi, tapping it in her hand. Holy shit, she gave him an empty
gun…</p>
<p><strong>the outdoor mall:</strong>: Wesley can’t believe his gun is
empty. In the split- second that it takes him to realize this, the
Consultant has his guns leveled, taking aim, but…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Pin shot bullets. Wesley looks down at the
gun.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Just like my father used on you. Fox nods,
as the Security Guards go to help the Consultant to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You were watching me in the office.</p>
<p>****: Protecting our assets. She hands the clip from the Imanishi
over to Wesley…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Time to do this for real.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: The mole bullet is made by a midget t
Filipino named Pek War. His fingers are so small that they can shape and
smooth the metal better than anyone.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You’ve known all along. You knew before I
ever broke the urn…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I had to let you figure it out for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Part of my training.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Part of your quest. To get to know your
father.</p>
<p>****: And his killer. Wesley nods, a grave expression on his face,
like he knows what he is going to do next.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Pek War charges exorbitant prices, as much as
ten-thousand dollars for a single round, but his craftsmanship is
unparalleled. He heads over to Wesley, hands him a slip of paper.</p>
<p><strong>’sloan</strong>: You can find him at this address.</p>
<p><strong>pex war</strong>: Andey? He gets no answer. He remains
perfectly still, listening.</p>
<p><strong>pek war</strong>: Andey?l Two louder THUMPS and a GUNSHOT
jerk his head around. Then he’s up out of the chair, faster than we
thought a little man could move. Breathing ragged, shimmying across his
work space, Pek War hurries over to a chest of drawers. He gets to it
and throws open the bottom drawer to reveal a stash of handguns. He
reaches for one… …but the muzzle off a pistol comes _ uE to the back of
his head and the hammer clicks as it is pulled back. Pek War throws his
hands up.</p>
<p><strong>pek war</strong>: Alam man lamangl Alam man lamangl Wesley
signals for him to turn around. After he does…</p>
<p><strong>per war</strong>: Alam man lamang! Wesley measures him with
eyes that have gone hard. Fox stands over Wesley’s shoulder, loving
every moment of this. Then…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: There are two things about you I’m sure of
right now, little man. One is that you can speak English… Pek War sees
that Wesley means business.</p>
<p><strong>per war</strong>: And what’s the other?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: That my nutsack is bigger than you. Fox
snickers.</p>
<p>****: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: A bullet you made killed his father. The bullet
maker looks as though he knew a day like this might eventually come. His
face falls and he looks.at his feet.</p>
<p><strong>per war</strong>: I only mold the ammunition… I cannot be
responsible for the way it is… Wesley SMASHES him in the face with the
butt of his gun, then grabs a long, metal STILETTO-type tool from the
work table.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Bullshit. You’re as responsible as if you
pulled the trigger yourself.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m only going to ask you one question and I
want you to think very hard how you want to answer. With that, Wesley
sticks the stiletto into Pek War’s side!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Relax. The blade is in only an inch or so.
The little man starts jabbering to God in some foreign language.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: See I’ve learned a thing or two about human
anatomy recently. In fact, this blade is stuck just beneath the coastal
cartilage of your tenth rib. Just a little push and it will deflate your
lung. That’s called a pneumothorax. V Helluva way to go, suffocating in
a’room full of fresh air. Plus the sound, the sound of all that oxygen
hissing out of your lung… pssssssh, like a balloon at a birthday party.
Enough to make a man beg for a second chance.</p>
<p>****: But you’re only going to have one. Pek War waits, trying not to
writhe from the pain…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: So my question is… how do I find Cross? Pek
War’s eyes go wide, pleading…</p>
<p>****: My clients use middlemen, I don’t meet them in person, I know
so little about them… Wesley twitches the handle just a bit.</p>
<p><strong>pek war</strong>: Okayl Okayl Dammitl God damiaitl I’ll tell
you!</p>
<p><strong>pek war</strong>: Prearranged meets. Fox snatches up a nearby
phone.</p>
<p><strong>wesley.</strong>: Start prearranging.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Wesley, you gotta know something. No matter
what kind of training you’ve done these last few weeks, killing your
first, well that’s gonna change you forever. Wesley drives for a while.
Then…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You know what my foster mother. told me when
I was six years old? Fox shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: She caught me eating some jello out of the
fridge after my bedtime. I knew I wasn’t supposed to but I was so damn
hungry, and it was just some fucking jello. Anyway, after she hit me so
hard I couldn’t bite down straight for a week, she told me… she told me
that God had killed my parents because I was such a wicked boy.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Jesus. Someone needs to find that bitch and set
her straight.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: So I grew up thinking I was the reason I
never knew my parents. But now, to find out, that no, my father didn’t
give me up because he had died… he gave me up because he was Protecting
me… well I guess I want to give him something back.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Not very discreet, are they? Fox smiles
knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley is talking about. On
various rooftops we-see FIGURES peering down. looking over the site.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: The others are only backup singers. This is
your show. Fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear, crouching
down. Just then, out the windshield, they see a MAN wearing a long black
overcoat approaching the corner near the newspaper building. Fox’s eyes
start to dance.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Remember: he’s good, baby. But you’re the best
I’ve ever seen. Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>in the street:</strong>: From a distance, Wesley approaches
Cross from the back. His steps become quicker, getting closer every
passing second. Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his gun… .and
that’s when Cross firesl Quick as lightning, Cross has guns out and lets
loose toward the roof of a nearby warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No! The minute Bellman exposes himself in
the open loading dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body
falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the dock. Wesley and
Fox join the other two on the dock as screaming WORKERS run from the
place.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: We need a way in there.</p>
<p><strong>electrician</strong>: Let’s find another door.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: He’ll be long gone by then.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: He’s got the high ground. Wesley sees an
unmanned forklift on the dock.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: On the pallet. They all jump on the pallet
held by the forks of the lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and
it backs into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching on the
pallet on the front.</p>
<p><strong>inside the newspaper building:</strong>: Once inside…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Separate. The lowest level is the loading
dock, where pallets of newspapers and massive unused paper rolls
await.</p>
<p><strong>with the electrician:</strong>: The Electrician hustles
between the pallets and boxes, eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to
a pallet of stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn’t
realize is that between each stack of papers is a space, just big enough
for a – THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits the
Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him around.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Cross’ gun. Another shot and we follow the
bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next space in the paper
stack – right where Electrician is now leaning… .the bullet buries in
his eye, sending him to the flog. Wesley sees Cross race for a set of
stairs. Just as Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden
beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The rolls tumble over
and Wesley has to dive out of the way, allowing Cross to escape up the
stairs. Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>on level two:</strong>: Giant printing machines are running
full speed, printing up the morning edition. A group of NEWSPAPER
EMPLOYEES see the guns the Fraternity members are toting and scramble
for safety. Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring
machines…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Stay here and cover us. There’s no angle for
him to hit you if you stay here. Wesley points at a scaffolding that
runs above the machines.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Don’t let him get up there. And stay clear
of the presses! He’ll use them however he can.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It’s what I’d do. With that, Wesley and Fox
disappear amongst the machinery. The Waiter takes a step back from the
press, where over a hundred pounds of paper spins through every second.
He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that scaffolding.
Everything looks clear, until… …shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o
Waiter’s head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans of spray
lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal, until Cross shoots one of
them out of the air, causing it to explode! The burning oil covers the
Waiter, who SCREAMS and stumbles nearer the printing press…</p>
<p><strong>bam bam bam!</strong>: More shots from Cross and one of the
RESTRAINING ARMS on the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in
half. The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a. saw, cuts
the Waiter in hplf ! With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the
presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes with Wesley…
..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep moving… He heads
up a second staircase, but not before he sends a stream of bullets back
at Fox, who athletically cartwheels away… .but one of Cross’s bullets
disintegrates a gear on the press near her, sending flying metal
everywhere. A piece of shXapnel b ies into Fox’s leg… making her break
out of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Fuuuucckkk! Cross races along the scaffolding
and disappears into a door.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Keep goin’, baby! Take him! Wesley races for
the stairs. He is the only one left to chase Cross to level three.</p>
<p><strong>on level three:</strong>: Wesley bursts through the door,
guns ready. The place is already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and
screaming and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he’s in the
business offices of the paper, and it looks surprisingly similar to his
old office. Lame-ass cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere. Wesley
jumps up on a desk.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Cross! Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk
on the other side of the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire
at Cross… who immediately returns fire… .and his bullets actually
collide with Cross’s by ets in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take
out a COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE. The two
assassins blast away, all while diving and moving over and in the
cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the Imanishis, and they each steer
their bullets at each other from sharp angles… Strangely,. the first
bullet collision was not blind luck, but the pattern for the battle.
They are fighting the same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle,
each man using the same techniques at the exact same time. Wesley needs
an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the words “Action Items” written
on it. He fires at it, and his bullets bounce off it at an angle where
one of them strikes Cross in the shoulder… THWAP!!! Cross can’t believe
he’s hit but he doesn’t have time to flinch… right as Wesley fires
again, he turns, barely avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a
nearby window, smashing the glass out,</p>
<p><strong>outside the window:</strong>: .we stay with Wesley as he
falls from the third floor, firing his guns the whole time… .until he
lands top of an “L” train moving at ll speed.</p>
<p><strong>the warehouse district:</strong>: Fox limps out of the
newspaper building and hurries to the Porsche. She ignores her wounds
and rips the car out of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L
train.</p>
<p><strong>on the l train:</strong>: Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on
the top of the train. He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at
Wesley… .but they both have to duck as the L train whips under an
overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere inches. Cross takes
the opportunity to swing down between cars and enter one of the L
cars.</p>
<p><strong>behind him:</strong>: Wesley hurries across the top of the
train, spying the trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his
wound. Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also swings
down between the cars and enters…</p>
<p><strong>the first l car:</strong>: .where he sees the trail of blood
leading all the way down the center of the empty car and out the back
door. Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready. He takes a
step forward to follow the blood trail, and immediately, he is decked
from the side by an ambushing Cross. They tumble over the first row of
seats, both losing their guns.</p>
<p><strong>on the train:</strong>: COMMUTERS ride along in blissful
ignorance, reading their papers, holding on to the handrails… completely
unaware of the gunfight raging outside the train. A bullet whizzes
through an open window, pierces a BUSINESSMAN’S paper, and exits a
window on the opposite side of the car. The man sticks his finger
through the hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>in the alley:</strong>: On opposite sides of the train,
Wesley and Cross are both sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end
of the last train, while dodging each other’s bullets… .as the last car
passes, they each jump on the tracks, ending u with guns tucked under
each other’s chin!</p>
<p><strong>cross</strong>: Wesley! This takes Wesley aback…</p>
<p><strong>cross</strong>: Look into my eyes! Wesley’s finger is
starting to squeeze his trigger… as is Cross’s.</p>
<p><strong>cross</strong>: Look into my eyes, goddammit!</p>
<p>****: Everything they told you was a lie, Wesley. With that… Cross
falls down. His black jacket spills open to show a gun shot wound not
just to his shoulder, but to hig n too. one of Wesley’s bullets through
the train must have found its mark. Cross is bleeding profusely. He
gasps a couple of times… then, with his last bit of energy…</p>
<p><strong>cross</strong>: Find the missing piece. And… don’t… let them…
dispose of the weapon… With that, the life goes out of Cross’s eyes.
Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some meaning there. But
Cross just stares blankly back at him, just as Fox comes limping up.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You did it, baby! Son of a bitch, you did it.
You put down motherfucking Cross! Wesley looks down and sees some of
Cross’s blood on his hands from their clench. There is also some on the
gun he is holding. ar –h d ed crun. Wesley reaches down and takes the
other pearl-handled gun from where it dropped and looks over them
both.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’d he say to you? Wesley looks up, sees
some sort of anticipation in Fox’s eyes. He looks back down at Cross’s
body..</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: He said… he said ‘pies on the Fraternity…’
Fox measures him, like she’s not sure if he’s telling the whole story.
Finally, she nods…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well… damn, I couldn’t be more proud of you,
baby! Let’s go lay this on Sloan!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I think I need.a minute to myself.</p>
<p>****: Sure. It’s your first kill. I’ll wait for you…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Naah, that’s all right. You need to get
stitched up. I’ll meet you at that Korean place.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You sure? But he’s already walking off. She
watches him go, thinking…</p>
<p><strong>on the bike:</strong>: Wesley sits and looks at one
particular house. He climbs off’and heads to the side of the house,
still carrying his book.</p>
<p><strong>side of the house:</strong>: He ducks through a broken
chain-link fence and moves down the side of the house… .until he finds a
familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar because we’ve seen this place before:
it’s where he lived when he was a foster kid. He removes the board, then
reaches into the hole. His hand seizes on something. From the hole, he
withdraws a KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North
Highbury St. Wesley’s eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the
key, and back to the book. Finally, he lowers his hands… revealing a
little eight- year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back
yard.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You live here? The kid.nods .</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Foster home? 4014 The kid nods again.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Read this. He tosses the kid the book and
heads off.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Come in, Wesley. He stares at her, trying to
figure this out. He steps…</p>
<p><strong>inside the house:</strong>: .and finds that the place is
nicely decorated; an attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced
bunker. Anna is now trying to hold back tears, but can’t.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’s dead, isn’t he? There’s no point lying to
this woman…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yes, ma’am. She nods knowingly, sadly.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He told me if he didn’t come back… it would be
you who pulled the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: ✓ He killed my father…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I think you need to meet someone… she leads
Wesley into another room, where a five-year-old boy, plays the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wesley. This is your brother… Andrew. Wesley’s
not sure what to make of this.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My brother?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Half-brother. But both of you, you are both
100 percent your.father’s boys. I’ve seen that from the beginning.
Andrew is busy playing with a couple of BLACK TOY BUILDINGS on the
floor. Wesley studies the little guy, still confused.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Your father… he was with you the whole time.
Wesley looks up and sees what she’s referring to. The walls are filled
with pictures of Andrew, Anna, and… remarkably… …photoaraths of Wesley
at various ages w hgn he was- growing u !</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This was his favorite. She hands him a picture
of Wesley at about age 12, sitting with his back to a tree, reading
COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. The picture has been taken through a windshield,
across the street. Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against
one of the walls…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery
store. But now we see that Fox positioned Wesley between herself and the
shooter. He wasn’t trying to hit Wesley, he was trying to separate him
from her.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Wesley studying Cross’s face in the file,
seeing that there isn’t jealousy in those eyes. Wesley still slumped
against the wall, surrounded by pictures of himself…</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Wesley reflected in Cross’s pupils. Holy
shitl!! Cross was his father!!! Wesley looks up at Anna’s kind face…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When your father and I found each other, when
we had Andrew, he said he could no longer live the way he had been
living. He said he wouldn’t give us up, the way he had given up his
first eon. Wesley stares at the picture… he can’t believe he was being
watched back when he felt so alone.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It was his greatest regret. She leaves him in
the room, alone, with his brother. Wesley watches the kid, trying to
process it all. For the first time, emotions overcome him, and he breaks
down… .but he’s too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob down in his
throat and blinks back the tears. Goddamn, he has a brother.</p>
<p><strong>in the kitchen of the safehouse - night - later</strong>: He
walks up behind Anna, who is sipping some coffee at a kitchen table, red
eyed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: would you like some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m okay. Wesley sets the key down on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Do you know what this opens?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I guess it’s not much of an inheritance.</p>
<p>****: He left me more than this. Wesley takes the coat and folds it
over his arm.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I want you to know that he forgave you before
you ever pulled the trigger. He tried to keep you out of it for so
long…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Why didn’t he just tell me?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: once they had you… he couldn’t risk it unless
you were alone. He knew his one shot at telling you might be his last.
Her eyes harden a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You have to finish what he was doing, Wesley.
It’s the only way any of us will ever be free. Especially your brother.
They won’t stop hunting us… your father knew that. Wesley nods.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’ll be back as soon as this is over.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You have family here. Wesley nods, these words
meaning so much to him.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Jesus. She squints, the setting sunlight nearly
blinding her as all she can see is a silhouette…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: For a second there I thought you looked just
like Cross. Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table as
Fox lights up a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Skipped the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: He picked me clean and I don’t care much for
needles. She blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises toward
the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Sloan’s on his way. One of the waiters waves to
her to put out her smoke and she just stares him down. The man backs
off, nodding and smiling.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You want something to eat, baby?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: They got some good shit. Ostrich, chicken…
won’t fill you up too much if you’re watching your calories.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Naah.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well, the big man should be here any
minute…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>****: Listen, can I ask you a :question?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Baby, you can ask me anything you want. He
focuses on her eyes, zeroing in on the pupils.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Did you know Cross was my father?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Did you know? Closer, closer… tight on those
pupils…</p>
<p><strong>o aw</strong>: What’re you talking about Wesley? Cross killed
your father.</p>
<p><strong>extreme close-up:</strong>: We see her pupil swell, just a
tiny bit.</p>
<p><strong>korean bar-b-que:</strong>: He saw it… exactly what Sloan
told him to look for when someone is lying. And from the look on Fox’s
face, she knows he saw it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Goddammit, Wesley… She stabs out her cigarette,
crushing it on the hot grill so that it SIZZLES.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Why’d you have to ask me that? With that, she
kicks back from the table, holding a huge black Smith and Wesson
revolver.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Arrrh!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You shoulda known better, baby… But he rolls
over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven- is burning into her back.
With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips herself
backwards off the table. With another kick, she sends the hot table
flying at him. It rips free from its wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas
out into the restaurant… SSSSSSSSS… Wesley knocks the flying table out
of the way, but not before it burns his arm as he blocks it. Spotting
his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a hailstorm of bullets.
But he’s too damn fast, and he dives across the floor Pete Rose style,
sliding to a stop at the precise moment where his hands come u holSling
his weapons. In.one fluid motion, he flips back over and EAM! BAM!</p>
<p>****: Aaaaahhhh! She’s firing both muzzles and her bullets find the
marks this time, knocking Wesley’s guns out of his hands from where he
lies flat on the floor. She’s disarmed him, and now he’s defenseless…
.and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face bleeding, both gun
barrels pointed right at Wesley’s face…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I gotta admit, baby… She starts to squeeze both
the triggers…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I thought we might have a future… But, Wesley
drives a fist into her wounded leg and she reels… In the same motion, he
grabs her wrists and pulls her toward him… taking her guns right out of
her hands like a quick-change artist. Flipping them over, Fox’s face
full of surprise is the last expression she’ll ever have because…</p>
<p><strong>fade out:</strong>: For several moments, there is nothing but
darkness and a silence as permanent as death. Finally…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: There’s a town in Germany called Leverkusen
that had a bear hunter named Hans Koblenz.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: 60 During his life, he was said to have
killed over four hundred bears and was the pride of this small community
on the Rhine. You want to know how he died? A pair of black bears
singled out his house from the entire village, mauled his wife, killed
his twin daughters, and then lied in wait for him to get back from the
woods.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: When the hunter opened the door, they ripped
his throat out before he could scream.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: The two bears then curled up on the rug LW
in the middle of the floor – the rug that had once been their father –
and proceeded to bite. each other till they bled to death. Sloan reaches
down and picks up the paper, and sees beneath it that pearl-handled
revolver. The one with the blood on the handle.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: That’s a true story. He unfolds it, to read
printed in black ink on the paper:</p>
<p><strong>7’he gates of t.t are open</strong>: Sloan folds the paper
back up and looks at the blood on the gun.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: He knows.</p>
<p><strong>map room:</strong>: .where the entire model city has been
destroyed, like a Giant has trampled it beneath its feet. Wesley stoops
over and pulls one smashed building out of the mess, looking at it,
thinking, thinking… .and then he’s up and moving quickly.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: My father… he was working on a plan,
right?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know. There was so much he wanted to
keep away from us… Wesley moves into Andrew’s roan… where the boy is
still playing with the black model buildings. Wesley moves over and
crouches down next to Andrew.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Can I see that for a second? The boy hands
him the building in his hand. It is painted jet black, except for one
corner of the first floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at
Anna.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Do you know where he got this?</p>
<p><strong>/’” anna</strong>: I-” Does this mean anything to you?</p>
<p>****: My God, he’s been planning it from the beginning.</p>
<p>****: This is a Fraternity hit. Cross… my fathar… set up Henry Helms
as bait, knowing Sloan would use his best men for the job. He was going
to take them all out. Wesley looks at it some more.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Only he didn’t know where on the route they
would try and hit Helms. That’s the missing piece he was t rying to
figure out.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do you know the answer to that? Wesley looks
up at her, resolve on his face.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No. But I know who does.</p>
<p><strong>knock knock knock.</strong>: A lump in a bed stirs.</p>
<p><strong>knock knock knock.</strong>: The lump stirs a little
more…</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: NICOLE, the hot girl from Wesley’s office,
moves to her peephole and looks out, but there’s no one there. She opens
the door and gives a quick look down the hall, then shuts it and hurries
to her kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Jesus… Wesley? Is that you? He looks bruised
and battered, but there is a hardness to his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It’s me, Nicole.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What happened to you? Wesley wipes his
eyebrow with his thumb, like he’s considering what he wants to say
next.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I asked you once if you thought I was an
observant person. She doesn’t understand… but suddenly we…</p>
<p>****: Who said I was the only sister? Maybe you just haven’t met any
others yet..</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Maybe I have and I’m just not telling you.
.and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley meant what he
said, and we…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Sloan didn’t just have one person in my
office watching me, he had two.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What name do you go by? The Intern? He
points at her tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Because I know you have the mark. Nicole’s
face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a switch. Like lightning,
she grabs for a butcher’s knife but Wesley is faster. He pins her wrist
back, twisting until she drops the knife. She lunges again, but a pistol
comes up right below her chin.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Where’s the Henry Helms hit going down?
Where’s Sloan?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Sloan’s not your biggest problem,
fuckface.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yeah? Why’s that? She reaches over, slowly,
so he knows she’s not going to go for a knife… and she turns on a small
TELEVISION sitting on the kitchen counter. The screen comes to life,
showing an inf mercial for the F ob’e. Nicole shakes her head and. flips
up the channels… and now we see what she wanted to show him…</p>
<p><strong>on the news:</strong>: Wesley’s EMPLOYEE PHOTO fills the
screen above a reporter’s head while the REPORTER babbles in a serious
voice…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: .responsible for several recent shootings,
including one tonight at this Korean restaurant downtown and another at
an outdoor mall. Details are sketchy, but we repeat, if you see this
man, please contact…</p>
<p><strong>in nicole’s kitchen:</strong>: She starts cycling through the
news channels… …and each one shows. different REPORTERS standing outside
the smoking bar-b-que, or talking about Wesley, or speaking with police.
One is even interviewing Wesley’s old boss, Janice, who is very happy
for the forum…</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: He was aggressive toward me and other
employees… a very negative person, extremely negative. I can’t even
repeat the words that came out of his mouth the day we let him go…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Motherfucker. Dispose of the weapon…</p>
<p>****: Me.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: That’s right. And the cops were told to
watch this place too. You have nowhere to go. He’s smarter than you.
He’ll feed the cops evidence singling you out for every hit the
Fraternity has pulled in the last ten years.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m only going to ask you one more time.
Where can I find him?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You won’t get to him. You can’t. The cops
will be here any second! Wesley reaches over- -and cranks up a gas
burner, the menacing flame on high.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Then this is going to get painful quickly.
She stares at that blue flame, fear in her eyes for the first time. He
starts pushing her head toward it, closer and closer…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Henry Helms. Where is it going down? The
first SCREAM from Nicole is lost in…</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Open up! Police! The door to
Nicole’s apartment smashes open and four cops burst through the door,
guns ready.</p>
<p><strong>police officer 2</strong>: Oh, Christ.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground:</strong>: One COP looks up and sees a figure
on the roof, long jacket blowing in the breeze. Surprisingly
conspicuous.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: What is it? The first cop points up toward
Wesley on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Air Support can you get a beam on the
four-story southeast of our position?</p>
<p><strong>on the rooftop:</strong>: Quickly, a spotlight lights up the
spot where Wesley was standing, but now we see it’s iust an
air-conditioning vent with soave loose streamers flapping off of it.
Damn, it looked just like Wesley a moment ago… was it?</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: Negative, roof is clean.</p>
<p><strong>dissolves to:</strong>: Morning…</p>
<p><strong>sarah helms</strong>: The car is here.</p>
<p><strong>henry helms</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>lead bodyguard</strong>: We’re not taking any chances. He
shuts the door for them before climbing behind the steering wheel. The
limo starts to make its way down the drive, flanked in front and in back
by dark SUBURBANS and the motorcycle cops.</p>
<p><strong>the gunsmith</strong>: Nothing yet, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Hold until I give the word. He clicks off the
radio and looks into his palm, where- e’s holding that pearl handled
aun, fingering the dried blood.</p>
<p><strong>on a city street:</strong>: The suburbans and cops flank the
limo as it rolls through the concrete jungle.</p>
<p><strong>in the limo:</strong>: The bodyguards peer up at the
buildings ready for anything. Henry Helms reaches over and grabs his
wife’s hand, a reassuring gesture. But his white knuckles betray his
trepidation. The driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the
east side of the river.</p>
<p><strong>on the road:</strong>: They make a turn along the river and
haul ass toward the bridge. Traffic is sparse and they look like they
have an easy clear passing.</p>
<p><strong>on the hospital rooftop:</strong>: The Gunsmith sits, waiting
patiently…</p>
<p><strong>on another rooftop:</strong>: Sloan watches the Limo starting
to approach the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Here comes the car. Any minute now. Take your
positions. Sloan leans out over the edge of his building, gun ready.</p>
<p><strong>quick shots:</strong>: On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith
puts down his binoculars and picks up a rifle. The Pharmacist leans over
the edge of a building and looks down, high-powered rifle in his hand.
On another building, the Chef does the same. And on still another
building, the Gardener also gets ready. Each killer is in a different
spot and has a gun, pointed and ready, just waiting for the signal…</p>
<p><strong>on the road:</strong>: The limo is about halfway up the
incline now, a sitting duck, hellfire about to rain down upon it.</p>
<p><strong>on the hospital rooftop:</strong>: The Gunsmith waits, waits,
waits… .and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of him, a
knife is held to his neck from behind. The Gunsmith doesn’t even so much
as swallow, as the blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a
drop of blood.</p>
<p>****: Wesley? The CAMERA MOVES TO THE SIDE to show Wesley crouched
right behind him, a look of icy determination on his face as he holds
the knife in place.</p>
<p>****: The name is Cross. In the distance, the Helms limo moves on,
safely.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Looks like you missed your chance. Now where
is Sloan? The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>gunsmith</strong>: You don’t understand, man. This ain’t
about Helms. The Intern told you right where to go… He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>gunsmith</strong>: .I’m just the decoy. THE CAMERA WHIPS
around behind Wesley… to show that three laser sights are lighting up
his back in a perfect pattern. And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up
to get Wesley in the open. The three surrounding rooftops, slightly more
elevated, hold each of the three assassins crouched-in sniper positions,
zeroed in on Wesley’s back. But instead of surprise, Wesley just leans
in closer to the Gunsmith’s ear.</p>
<p>****: She told me that, too. And with that, he rolls the o0 over of ,
just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash a hail of
bullets. BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The Gunsmith takes a dozen shots, all
in the chest, but none of the bullets make it through the Gunsmith’s
body.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Should’ve studied your anatomy, fellas.
Wesley FIRES BACK indiscriminately at the neighboring rooftops, lying on
his back, using the.dead assassin’s body as a shield.</p>
<p><strong>on the rooftops:</strong>: The assassinB-all disappear from
their positions and head to the street.</p>
<p><strong>sam bam! ding ding!</strong>: The Butcher deflects them with
the knives in his hands: Wesley goes to fire again but his firing
chambers recoil, showing that he is out of ammo. The Butcher’s eyes go
wide…</p>
<p><strong>the butcher</strong>: Like I told you… the blade will always
live on.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I remember some dumb shit like that coming
out of your mouth. Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls
out the kniZ2 in his shoulder. They charge each other, the blades
whizzing and clanging off each other as each tries to gain an edge. The
fight spills out the front door, and into…</p>
<p><strong>the street:</strong>: .the two men slashing, ducking, and
moving in the middle of the street. - Wesley strikes three auick swipes
acrosiLthe Butcher’s face And forehead, filling his eyes with blood. The
Butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming on to his hands. He
tries to wipe the blood from his eyes, but it’s just getting worse.</p>
<p><strong>the butcher</strong>: I can’t see!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But you can hear. So hear this: To cut the
subclavian artery, hold the knife ice- pick style… Wesley lunges and the
Butcher is defenseless to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: …and thrust down behind the clavicle,
cutting side to side. He does just as he describes and the big guy
topples over as his gore spills out into the street. But before he can
gloat, Wesley realizes his new predicament… He’s standing in the middle
of the street, and at one end is the chef, and at the other is the
Gardener. To make things worse, directly across the street from Wesley
is the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: Three on one, mate. You’re out of
ammo. And you’re in a part of the map with no Fraternity stashes.</p>
<p>****: That’s what I’d call a real ball ache. For a moment, Wesley
stands there, sizing up the situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener
to the Chef to the Pharmacist. Just then, the buildings ound all of them
go black., just like in cross’s model! Wesley’s eyes fall on the on the
red corner of the nearest building, a cement block making up a
decorative support column in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m working off of a different map. With
that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and he races for the
building, jumping up onto and over a Lexus parked at the curb. The three
assassins fire relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car,
smashing it to bits… as… . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a
slide just as he reaches that cement block… affixed to it is a small
SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross and the cement block
mechanically opens, revealing: a new pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I As
his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the guns, spins, splits
both hands apart and we…</p>
<p><strong>splitscreen:</strong>: …to follow both of his bullets in
flight.</p>
<p><strong>on the left side of the screen:</strong>: .THE BULLET from
the left gun heads for the Chef. He tries to drop down, but the bullet
curves downward, it pierces his body… and…</p>
<p><strong>inside his body:</strong>: We see the bullet ricochet off of
one of his ribs-exit his side and head for the Pharmacist, while…</p>
<p><strong>on the right side of the screen:</strong>: …the bullet from
the right gun heads for the Gardener, who moves fast to fire his own
gun, but the bullet catches him in the wrist, knocking his gun out of
his hand, and…</p>
<p><strong>inside the wrist:</strong>: . it hits the Gardener’s scaphoid
bone, ricocheting out, also, right at the Pharmacist…</p>
<p><strong>the screen returns to normal:</strong>: .just as the two
bullets come together…</p>
<p><strong>the pharmacist</strong>: Bugger.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>the gardener</strong>: Where it started.. BAN! Wesley ends it
for the Gardener.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Can’t say I don’t have a sense of irony. The
place I first decided to bring you in. Wesley is clutching his wounded
shoulder with his wounded hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big
red drops.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You once asked why I helped hide you as an
infant… It gave me power, Wesley’. Power to become a head of the
Fraternity. Power over your father. And ultimately it gave me you: the
perfect weapon to kill your father.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But now you have to dispose of the
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: In some ways it pains me to do so. You 460
are like the son I never had.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fuck you. Sloan’s eyes narrow.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Fine. Keep your worthless dignity. You’re
still just the same loser we plucked off the street six weeks ago.
Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs derisively.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: You can’t win, Wesley. The Fraternity is
everywhere. Even if you kill me others will come from other cities to
take my place. You’ll be hunted your whole life.</p>
<p>****: But that’s not gonna happen. Like I told you before, when we
are called, death is as certain as the sun. Wesley stands as straight as
he can muster. The two men face each other like two gunmen on Main
Street in Dodge city… an old newspaper even blows through like a
tumbleweed. And we are close on Wesley’s face. act it i the same shot
from the opening of the movie.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.
We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his bleeding arm,
reaching into his sleeve…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But not today. With that, he nulls out the
matching pearl-handled gun, the twin-brother of the one Sloan is
holding, and they both open fire… .Wesley shoots Sloan’s bullets out of
the air and Sloan does the same. Just like he did with h’ father. .But
Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it’s mark, hitting Wesley
sSMarely in the same arm that took the knife.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Uhhh! He can’t raise his arm, it’s useless,
but he’s come too damn far to stop now… he flips his gun from his good
hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING! Then Wesley does
something unexpected… he starts sprinting straight at Sloan, still
knocking his bullets out of the air… He closes the gap… ten feet… five
feet… ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on Sloan’s
face,.like what is this kid doing? But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots
the gun out of Sloan’s hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his
feet! They go flying right over the edge of the building. Wesley’s able
to grab on to a railing cable and stop himself… ..but Sloan is going to
go over. At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something. anything. and
grabs one-handed the barrel of Wesley’s gun… For a moment, they dangle
there in this precarious position, looking each other in the face. Sloan
can’t believe he’s been bested by this kid.</p>
<p>****: Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like you did your old man.
Wesley’s finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then he smiles…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m done with this life. Just like my
father. And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h</p>
<p><strong>from two hundred feet below:</strong>: We watch Sloan’s body
fall through the sky…</p>
<p><strong>on the rooftop:</strong>: Wesley rolls over on to his back,
looking up at the darkening sky.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It’s true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary
and-pathetic. Just like you. He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But I’ve learned something in that time.
I’ve learned about the man who made me.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’ve learned about the man I am.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’ve learned that all of us are unique, even
though sometimes we’re too fucking blind to see it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: And I learned, the easiest place to hide is
in plain sight. .it comes back DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, until it finds…</p>
<p><strong>associates</strong>: Setting the Bar Highl” Office workers
mill about in their drab suits and ties, wishing they were anywhere
else. A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You’re the new guy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Just started last week.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Where’d you move here from?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: All over the place, really. Nothing too
exciting.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Well, welcome to the team. Just watch
out for Brokaw. He’ll stab you in the back first chance he gets. Just
then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up.</p>
<p><strong>brokaw</strong>: Jesus, Connie, don’t you have some faxes to
get to? The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does.</p>
<p><strong>brokaw</strong>: Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun
bags, I’ll give her that.</p>
<p><strong>brokaw</strong>: Jim, right?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brokaw</strong>: Listen, Jim, I don’t want to get started off
on the wrong foot here, but we.have numbers to make and if we don’t make
those numbers, it’s my ass on the line. And if my ass gets chewed out by
regional, I can guarantee.that your ass is gonna be Purina doggy chow.
Now I’m not sure how they ran things… Wesley stares at that mouth
zeroing in further and– further, until the words become gibberish, just
like they did with Janice. Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it,
just in time to hear…</p>
<p><strong>brokaw</strong>: .so do we understand each other?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>brokaw</strong>: Good boy. With that, he hurries away, his
pants riding so high up his ass that they look like they may burst at
any second. Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads
11:15. He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the receptionist’s
desk. She looks up, bites her lower lip…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You want to take a break with me?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Sure! She stands and they move toward
the elevators, waiting for the doors to open.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You know, we don’t usually get
breaks.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Well, you’ll find there’s nothing “usual”
about me. They climb in. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on
Wesley’s face…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: This life is ours, to make of it what we
can. .until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot of Wesley we
started with. And then a sly smile spreads across his mug…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I think I’ll give it a shot. .and as the
doors close, we officially…</p>
