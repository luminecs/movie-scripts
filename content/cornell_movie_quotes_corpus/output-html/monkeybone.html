<h1 id="monkeybone">monkeybone</h1>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It was third grade. The teacher was Miss
Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she smelled funny - but she was
kind.</p>
<p><strong>class!</strong>: How many times have I told you? In this
class we do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley’s head!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know how some teachers have those, kind
of, flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp flab that like,
dangle?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It sounds weird…but for some reason, as I
watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to feel…well…oddly…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: …aroused. And then the horror began.</p>
<p><strong>miss hudlapp</strong>: Young man. What’s that in your
lap?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap
on the Washington Monument. And then…all at once …there he was.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Monkeybone!!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How about it, Doc? Can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: Not overnight. These imaginary monkey cases
take time. I vould estimate…roughly…</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: Twelve years and three months ought to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: One question, doc - what did you mean when
you said “imaginary”?</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: All in good time, my boy. All in good
time.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: Vot a crackpot! Monkey on ze back - HAH!!
ROLL</p>
<p><strong>voice in backpack</strong>: Imaginary, huh? You quack.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I’ll never
find a good shrink.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Those guys are a waste of money! I’ll
show you how to stop sucking your thumb…</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Thank you…that’s our pilot…the good news is,
Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an order for six new
episodes!</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Now, let’s give it up for the guy who started
it all. Creator of America’s most disturbed comic strip…the man behind
the monkey…Mister Stu Miley!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t actually draw all the animation, no. We
have sweatshop workers who couldn’t get jobs at Nike doing that.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful fan</strong>: Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone
on my belly? As a guide?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Guide…?</p>
<p><strong>beautiful fan</strong>: For my tattoo artist?</p>
<p><strong>beautiful fan</strong>: Wait! You have to draw the rest of
him -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor.
DO-</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, Doc. Come here. There’s something really
cool I want to show you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out
…they close…you can’t get back in!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You want to leave? But Stu - you’re a big
hit! Everyone loves you!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They don’t love me. They love Monkeybone.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It was you who got the standing O. It was you
drawing on the belly over there…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I
don’t want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want
to be us. Home. Alone! I have something I have to give you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Can’t you give it to me later?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got
here sooner, it would be…better.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Sorry, Julie - won’t be a minute. Now Stu - I
know you don’t like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys
-</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Julie and I - we were just gonna go…</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Go? There’s a potload of money here, pal. You
got three major toy companies…you got the guys from Burger God over
here…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in
the french fries?</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Never proven. They’re ready to pop for a pre-
emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Herb, it’s too much. It’s all out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Do you know what kind of opportunity you have
here? You gotta strike. I’m talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne
for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t want to be rich. It’s just a trap!</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie
perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Herb. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I got the ring. Tonight’s the night, Herb.
Tonight’s the night.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Oh my God…you’re proposing?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she…
fixed it. She made me happy. Which I’d never been. She loves me the way
I am - right now.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: …In some weird way I respect that.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Okay then. If I get you out of here - you pop
the question - tonight. Or else. Get me?</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: They’re just prototypes…take ’em home and look
at ’em before you say no… If you could just hold on a minute or two,
we’re expecting a couple more trucks.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Okay, okay! You’re a beautiful couple. Go.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Look at this! He won’t let us leave!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The monkey!! He’s everywhere! He’ll take over
both our lives if we let him.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck. You
thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he’s probably going to make
you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m trying. It’s weird, that’s all. I never had
any good luck, until I met you…what if it’s all just another bad
dream?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s the “bad” part?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I might wake up.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I am happy. It just so happens this is the
happiest night of my life.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Sunday Nights This Fall</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That damn monkey is everywh–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Did we just - hit something?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Are you okay??</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey! Are you guys all right in there?</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: We’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my
windshield - it practically killed us all! God, Julie, if anything had
happened to you -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m fine, baby. We’re all okay. We were
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’d better go report this…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Dad’s car?</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: What was that? Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Operator? I want to report an accident.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu? I’m here, baby. It’s me. It’s Julie. I
love you. You’re gonna be okay, baby, I promise -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m here, baby. I won’t leave you…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Cigars, mister? Genuine Coobans!</p>
<p><strong>rabbit</strong>: Wanna meet my sister?</p>
<p><strong>singing sphinxes</strong>: Weeee…welcome you to Dark Town And
while you’re in your coma This odd amusement park-town Will be your Home
Sweet Homa -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Help me. Please. There’s animals. They -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Pony ride, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>joe camel</strong>: Hey, Mister. Mister! Got a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>live! nightmares! live!</strong>: First-Run - Continuous
Performances - Popular Prices</p>
<p><strong>head #1</strong>: Hey, aren’t you Stu Miley?</p>
<p><strong>head #2</strong>: We’re big fans.</p>
<p><strong>head #3</strong>: Could we have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Chasing me - animals - horrible -</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Animals? What kind of animals?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right?
That’s what everybody says - although personally, I don’t see the
resemblance. What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Uhh - martini?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Olive or eyeball?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Olive. - Where exactly am I?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I’m Bull.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Stu Miley.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Yeah, I’ve seen a few of your dreams. You’re
quite a celebrity down here.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: I told you, it’s the land of nightmares. Same
on every channel…all the stuff people dream, after they have the extra
anchovies.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night
cable.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Sad commentary, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I was, uh, just getting ready to leave…</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of
ventriloquist here.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Just kiddin’, folks! Drinks for
everybody -</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Just a spike, ma’am. It happens. It’s
perfectly natural with coma patients.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m a doctor too. I know this man’s brain
-</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Go home, Doctor. Rest. Come back when you
can do us some good.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Julie?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Now don’t pick a fight. I’m staying over.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, poor Buster. He hasn’t been fed in a day
and a half. Let me get some food…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Special occasion?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know. I guess it was…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Don’t get all poignant. We’re keeping this
bottle on ice. When he comes around you’re going to need it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Who did this?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu. That was right about the time we
met.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: When he first came in to the sleep lab?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah…before your time.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Jesus, honey…he always joked about you curing
him, but I never realized what you cured him from.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He hadn’t gotten a good night’s sleep in
years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he’d start right in
painting…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: How do you get from here - to there?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Switch hands.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m serious. It was bicameral disjunction -
right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made
him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what’d come out.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Monkeybone?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Left-handed, he was funny. He’d been doing
all this scary, intense work…then he found out he could draw this stuff,
and make me laugh, and he liked that. And then the nightmares
just…stopped.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one
did you fall in love with?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ve put a ton of work into that boy, Alice.
I am not going to let him get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Kimmy…?</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Oh, Julie…my poor Stu…my poor baby
brother…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: When’d you get in?</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: An hour ago. I tried to prepare myself, but I
didn’t know he would be like, like this. I can’t even bear to look at
him… How about you? You’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m fine, Kimmy. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: I had so much I always wanted to say to him.
At least he had a chance to give you the ring.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The ring…</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Grandmama’s ring. The engagement ring. He
asked me to send it to him -</p>
<p><strong>voice from behind</strong>: Mrs. Brewster? Julie? I’m
Dr. Edelstein.</p>
<p><strong>dr. edelstein</strong>: Vital signs have stabilized. That’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Can you give us a realistic sense of my
brother’s chances?</p>
<p><strong>dr. edelstein</strong>: He’s held on this far. We can’t do
much but wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: But these…machines are what’s keeping him
alive, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. edelstein</strong>: At the moment, yes.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Can you give me a realistic idea…of how long
this is going to last?</p>
<p><strong>dr. edelstein</strong>: Comas are unpredictable. He could
wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now…</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is,
Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors - hospitals
- needles - all of it -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Kimmy, he doesn’t know what’s going on. He
doesn’t even know he’s in a -</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our
father took a long time to die. A long time. It just about killed us
all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn’t let
it drag out.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s too soon even to - talk about that!</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: Give me a date, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. edelstein</strong>: Three months.</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We
can certainly give it…three months.</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: And now the last of our five finalists…Miss
Michigan…GEORGE T. WILLOUGHBY!</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: And now George will give us his analysis of
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle as it pertains to third-world
economics!!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m gonna wash that man right outta my
hair!</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good
humiliation nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three
months since the accident - and I’m no closer to going home than I was
then.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: Aw, buck up. Have another ’tini.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m sick of martinis. I’m sick of the waiting,
and the carnival rides, and watching people’s nightmares. And of course,
I need not add -</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Thank you, thank you for that very
modest</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: We’ve got a special dedication tonight.
This one’s from my ever-lovin’ boss, Mr. Stu Mopey - I mean Miley - and
we’re sendin’ it up to a very special lady in the land of the living.
Yes, I do mean Julie - the beautiful Miss Julie - who, if she has a
brain in her head, is shacked up right now with some good-lookin’ doc
she met in the E.R.! JUST KIDDING, BUDDY! Because if we know anything
about Miss Julie, we know she is faithful, loyal, and true. Even if her
boyfriend is an eggplant. Which is why we’re dedicating…this very
special tune…to her. Jumbo?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH! MAH
baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You have humiliated me in public for the
last</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I doubt that. Besides, I can’t help
myself. I’m just a figment of your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Then you can learn to act normally. I had
to!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Aw, come on. You know you love me.
You’re a masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I am not. And I don’t gotta.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: You are too! Mooning over Julie when we
could both be gettin’ some o’ this fine local action. It’s not like
she’s gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don’t
count.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sorry. The women here aren’t my type. Most of
them aren’t even my species.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Hellooooooooo, Kitty.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Hiya, Stu. Refill on that martini?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I’d like something with an umbrella in
it and a really smutty name. Like a…Sex Behind the Sofa with Your
Parents in the Same Room Watching “The Brady Bunch.”</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Nothing for him! He’s being repressed.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so
tense.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Aaah, it’s the same as always…poor
mope’s just wishin’ he was me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve been trying to get through to the head guy
- the nightmare god - what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Hypnos?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But
I wait, and I wait, and…I’m starting to think I’ll never see her
again.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I shoulda proposed, Kitty. That way at least
she’d know how I feel. That way she’d…wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is.
Guys like you don’t come along that often. Believe me, I know.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let
us boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I mean it, Stu. You’re one in a million.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not so special. I’m just - kind of -</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Come on, pal! It was a compliment!
You’da done the same if you had the equipment!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I’m reportin’ this to my union!!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What union?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: The sidekicks’ union! Me, Tonto, and
Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your ass!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I left my phone number in your undies.
Try not to lose it in traffic.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sorry, Kitty! I’ll be right back after I choke
my monkey.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Him. Whew. About time!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Can’t hear you, young fellow. Speak up!</p>
<p><strong>reaper</strong>: EARL BIEGLER, I’VE COME TO GIVE YOU - aw,
hell. Here.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: An E-Ticket!</p>
<p><strong>patron</strong>: He got a reprieve.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Good for him! He’s gonna wake up!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. No. Not him.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: So long, suckers! See you in the funny
papers!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He’s ninety. He’s practically dead already. How
come he goes back and I stay here?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Maybe he wanted to pick out his own
casket?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He got an E-ticket. Where’s mine? When do I
get</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Stu? Stu? Let’s not disturb the nice
Reaper.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve been stuck down here for months. Somebody
had better start paying attention, or I’m gonna - I’m gonna kick
ass!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Let’s not kick the nice Reaper’s
ass.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Stu? Stu? Let’s calm down, talk things
over. How about some comedy relief? Okay. Brontosaurus walks into a gay
bar…</p>
<p><strong>stu/monkeybone</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Stu? Stu? I think weve got this
backwards. Your behavior…is disturbing me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s right. Run! And don’t come back unless
you’ve got my e-ticket!!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who am I kidding? I’m never gonna get out of
here. I’ll never see her again.</p>
<p><strong>messenger boy</strong>: Miley? Stu Miley?</p>
<p><strong>pajama party</strong>: at HYPNOS’ HIDEAWAY</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what
this means, Monkeybone? He’s finally going to hear my case. I’m going
home!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I think we can go another day without
shaving. Long as you don’t look like you’re growing one of those stupid
little goatees.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hey, there’s an article about the Monkeybone
show. They’ve run that one episode about eight times now. Herb says it
gets higher ratings every time…they’re hoping you’ll give ’em some new
material soon… Wanna hear another joke?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay…let me see…here we go. A plane full of
explorers crashlands in New Guinea; they are captured by a cannibal
tribe and taken to the chief’s hut, where…wait a minute. I know this
one…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay. Let’s try again. Why did the pervert
cross the road?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Kimmy! What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: This is hard for me, Julie…very hard…but it’s
been three months now, and… I gave the order.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Now this…is livin’.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Y’call that art? Why, my three-year-old
can paint better than that.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Like you’d know. You started out on the back of
a napkin, you little…doodle.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Hey! Like the do. So tell me, are you a,
uhh… natural snakehead?</p>
<p><strong>gorgon</strong>: Only fifty dollars to find out.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Fifty dollars?! Bite me!</p>
<p><strong>gorgon</strong>: You got it, big boy.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Say, have you seen Mr. Hypnos?</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: Hyp? He was here a while ago. Aren’t you
Stu Miley? The nightmare guy?</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: I heard you were going to be here
tonight. This is so cool!</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: You fat slob! Watch what you’re
doing!</p>
<p><strong>jumbo</strong>: Why don’t you slap me? Go on, slap me!</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: Come on, Stu. Let’s go where the real
fun is.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wow. Live feed, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: You bet. Hyp gets all the best stuff
before it goes out to the theatres.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: Shh! There’s a new one just
starting.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That - that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: Nice shirt, dude!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What is this? Who’s dreaming this?? Julie??</p>
<p><strong>yeti</strong>: Hey, keep it down!</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: Stu!! What are you doing? Chill
out!!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. No. STU!</p>
<p><strong>cyclops</strong>: HEY! Watch it, you stinkin’ gringo -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu? STU…?</p>
<p><strong>jumbo</strong>: Who invited this schmuck, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>hand woman</strong>: Oh, it’s my fault. I thought he was
cooler than that.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Listen. Please. It’s my girlfriend. I’ve gotta
get a message to her…</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I knew I left it in there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Haw! I like a monkey with vision!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: You said it, partner!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How’d you get in there?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Stu… It’s a party.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you
-</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and
girls …Mr. Stu Miley, in the house!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was
having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was
watching me die.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Uh huh. And?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to
let her know I’m okay. Until I can get out of here…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: …which is actually what I wanted to talk to you
about. See, I’ve been here three months -</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Kid - didn’t they tell you about this
party?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: It’s a special kind of party. A farewell
party. Do you…get what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Farewell? You mean - you mean I’m -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I think I…I’m about to… Am I mistaken, or don’t
I get to… Is there some…</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Y’see, Stu, as I understand it, you made
this pact with your sister…no life support?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Well - yeah - but that doesn’t…apply. It was
different then. I was depressed. My life is great now. I’m in love!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Pull the plug! Pull the plug! Take my
organs! I don’t need ’em! I don’t need no! Life support! I’m an idiot!
Pull the pl–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Besides, Julie wouldn’t…she’d never…</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Actually, Stu, Julie doesn’t get to decide.
That’s why she was having the nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Nine AM! But that’s - twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I’m so dumb! I deserve to die -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I’m begging
you. There’s gotta be something I can do.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Stu, I like you personally, I admire your
work, but I’m just the God of Sleep. This is Death’s bailiwick.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Maybe you could talk to Death!</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it
will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to
that piece of -</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Now Death is not what you would call a
people person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should know. I’m his
little brother.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re Death’s brother?</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass,
My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity,
you get pretty damned tired of that schtick.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: The penthouse is pretty swank,
though.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Thank you. I decorated it myself.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Guys, I don’t mean to be rude, but I only have
eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to…</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Oh, right. Cheating Death. There’s one thing
you might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled it off. Well,
actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who…well, very few
people have done it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hyp, I’ll do anything.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Me too. And I mean anything. Ask the
chicks in the back room.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: You’ve seen those E-tickets, right? Well,
what you gotta do…is go into the Land of Death… and steal an E-ticket
right out from under Death’s nose.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Land of Death. How do I get there?</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Kid, listen: that’s all I’m saying. And you
didn’t hear it from me.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: You’ve heard of a fate worse than Death?
That’s what’s waiting for you if you screw up.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Fate worse than death! Well, it’s been
real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum�. ANYBODY</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Fine! Don’t put yourself out. I’ll go to the
land of Death alone.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Stu, you have my absolute confidence. �-
DEAD</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve got one chance to get back to Julie, and
I’m gonna take it - with or without you.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Hey. Aren’t you gonna talk me into
it?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: You gotta talk me into it. You’ll screw
up on your own. I mean, a guy’s gotta have a sidekick. For moral
support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - It’s the land of Death, Stu, the
Land of Death! Don’t go in there without your comedy relief!!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: All right. You can come.</p>
<p><strong>oh, thank you! thank you! th–</strong>: Something went very,
very wrong here.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Now we just gotta figure out how to get
there.</p>
<p><strong>lulu</strong>: Shay, you’re kinda cute.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Say there. How ’bout one for the road?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hold this for me, pally.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ooopsy daisy.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Is that what they call “death with
dignity”?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Two words for you, my friend: club
soda.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He’s taking her to the land of Death, right? So
all we’ve gotta do is…hitch a ride! Stop shaking! I’ll protect you.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Oh, sure. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn’t
I be Arnold Schwarzenegger’s figment?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Where’d he go??</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Six hours. That’s when they pull the plug.
That’s how long we’ve got to wake him up.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: …they show incredibly intense nightmare
activity. The chart below is his new chart…</p>
<p><strong>hutch</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.
Anybody here know what Oneirix is?</p>
<p><strong>clarissa</strong>: Sure - it’s an enzyme. The brain secretes
it during violent dream activity…</p>
<p><strong>hutch</strong>: It’s nightmare juice. Julie and I were on the
team that learned to synthesize it. If those charts are right, Stu’s
swimming in the stuff. Are you thinking we can decrease the levels?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No. I want to give him more. I want to give
him a massive dose.</p>
<p><strong>hutch</strong>: That’s not going to stop his nightmare -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I
want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to
scare him awake.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: All right! We have a plan. Let’s move!</p>
<p><strong>hutch</strong>: You know, Julie, even if this works - which
it probably won’t - that stuff is tricky. You don’t know what it’ll do
to his brain.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’ll it do if they pull the plug?</p>
<p><strong>reaper</strong>: Batch of souls - just back from
Processing.</p>
<p><strong>death’s assistant</strong>: Put them over there with the
others.</p>
<p><strong>death’s assistant</strong>: Your Grimness? We have a new
shipment -</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Last Days of Pompeii…now there was a Great
Moment in Death.</p>
<p><strong>death’s assistant</strong>: If I may point out…it is
12:05…</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I can’t believe - oh, man, I - SINATRA!! Do
you know how long I’ve been waiting for this?</p>
<p><strong>death’s assistant</strong>: Make that 12:07, your
bleakness…the dispatch team is waiting…</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Okay, okay, send ’em in. Jeez.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Chakasandra Singh, New Delhi.
Snakebite.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Mulrooney, Lavinia P., Dearborn,
Michigan. Head crushed in a pants press.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: You’re the customer, okay? You’re about to
die. It’s a big occasion. A formal occasion. And as you shuffle off this
mortal coil, the last thing your eyes behold is a Grim Reaper covered
with… What the hell is that??</p>
<p><strong>stu monkeybone</strong>: Cranberry Margarita. Sex on the
Beach.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: …What??</p>
<p><strong>stu monkeybone</strong>: Salty Dog. Sufferin’ Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Well - whatever it is - you get that shroud
to the dry cleaner ASAP! Now where were we?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Clarke P. Devereaux, San Francisco.
Complications resulting from coma…</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Oh, wait. Says here he’s supposed to
recover.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Take this to Dark Town. Sad to say, he’s
gonna live another forty years. Sorry. Nobody said this job would be
easy.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Say, Death, just out of curiosity, could
we maybe swap jobs with that other guy? See, we’ve been meaning to drop
in on Dark Town - I mean I’ve been meaning to…</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: …I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: I got relatives there. I…EEP!!</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Now what were you saying?</p>
<p><strong>stu/monkeybone</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I’d like to have a word with you in
private.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: HYPNOS! That little twerp! He’s the one who
put you up to this!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Yowie.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Head. HEAD!!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Stu…Stu…</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: There’s a thing here! There’s a
switch!</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Stu…LOOK!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Isn’t that Lulu?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Now we’ve got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Weren’t we just here?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: What’d I tell you? You go to the Land of
Death, wear a jockstrap!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s the maximum safe dose?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Most we’ve ever used is half a CC.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Five CC’s.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: This ain’t my nightmare!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would’ve
made it without you.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Move it. We got exactly five minutes
left.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s just…now that I’m leaving, I feel like
there’s lots of things I haven’t said. Who’s gonna look out for you? Are
you gonna be okay when I’m gone?</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Oh, don’t you worry. I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’ve been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure
wish I could take you home with me.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are
you? Well, there’s a new twist.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Don’t joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I
really do love y–</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Love you too. Boss.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Stop! Monkeybone! Please!!</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Sorry, Stu. It’s all part of the deal. We’ve
got big plans for that body of yours!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oooie! That smarts!!!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Julie?… Hey, you are a looker.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It’s a miracle. It’s a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Two more ticks of the clock…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thank you. Thank you for coming back to
me.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Boy, I don’t know about you guys, but I’m
starving.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who are y– WHAT DO YOU WANT??</p>
<p><strong>genghis khan</strong>: Dinner.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Alfred Hitchcock??</p>
<p><strong>edgar allan poe</strong>: A fat bastard, but damn quick on
his feet.</p>
<p><strong>typhoid mary</strong>: That’s how he keeps his girlish
figure.</p>
<p><strong>stephen king</strong>: Gotta move fast in this crowd, or
you’ll starve. Here you go, pal. Have some popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What is this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>stephen king</strong>: They feed us the slops from the
Morpheum Theatre. You hope for Jujubes, settle for goobers. - I’m Steve.
Steve King.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Stephen King? What are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>jack the ripper</strong>: I’m Jack the Ripper.</p>
<p><strong>typhoid mary</strong>: Typhoid Mary.</p>
<p><strong>atilla the hun</strong>: Atilla the Hun. Trade you a Twizzler
for a box of Raisinets!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Atilla the - ! What in hell is this place?</p>
<p><strong>rat guard</strong>: All hail the most glorious! Most eminent!
Most esteemed all-powerful God of Sleep…his Royal Lassitude -</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Enough, enough, I’m hung over.</p>
<p><strong>typhoid mary</strong>: Hyp! Did you bring me the cough
medicine?</p>
<p><strong>stephen king</strong>: Did you remember the night light I
asked for?</p>
<p><strong>edgar allan poe</strong>: King, you pussy.</p>
<p><strong>stephen king</strong>: Bite me, Poe! I hate waking up in the
dark.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how’s our
new guest settling in - ?</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you.
It ain’t easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last
guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why’d you do it? What’d I ever do to you?!?</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: It’s simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots
of ’em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the
flow…a nightmare maker! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin…we’ve been doing
this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: But why me? Why’d you pick on me??</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: The monkey, of course. It was his idea.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Monkeybone…!?</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one
day he comes to us - he’s got a proposition. We help him get your
body…in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re nuts! I’m a comic strip artist! What’s
he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons??</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Oh, no, no, no. Y’see, Stu, as it happens,
that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams.
And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Oh, we’re predicting a record box-office.
It’s like I always say…nightmares are your best entertainment!</p>
<p><strong>kimmy</strong>: I just couldn’t stand the thought of you
suffering. I love you so, I would never have… forgive me, Stu. Please
forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Kimmy. Chill. We’ve still got a pact. If
anything ever happens to you, I’ll be right there to return the favor.
So drive carefully! From now on.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, baby, I can’t believe you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was
expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake
in, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Meaning me, of course. I’m referring to
myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative
franchise…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Baby? Why don’t you just…rest on the sofa for
a minute. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Here’s to a bottle…we should have opened…
three months ago.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Bitchin’ good cake.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu, are you…feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Sure. Why?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re acting kind of…odd.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Buster! Look who’s here!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Oh shit, the cake!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Mine. Get back! MINE!!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What are you watching?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Ohhh, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You sure this is…medically advisable?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Got a doctor on duty.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well. As long as it’s okay with Monkeybone
-</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, God!! Baby! Are you -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How was it? I don’t recall.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It was great, baby. Let’s get you to the
ER.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not like the rest of you. I’m just a
regular guy! I’m not a “nightmare maker.”</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Neither are we. We got our bodies hijacked
just like you. The guys who replaced us are the nightmare makers!</p>
<p><strong>attila</strong>: Like me. I was a mess sergeant in the Mongol
Horde. I never wanted to be the Scourge of Asia. I just wanted a new
recipe for yak!</p>
<p><strong>jack the ripper</strong>: I was Jack the Haberdasher.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments?
…Monkeys??</p>
<p><strong>stephen king</strong>: Hey, I got screwed over by my own dog.
Go through hell to get that E-ticket, and who winds up in my body? That
darn Cujo.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: He’s sure got a thing for those icy
blondes.</p>
<p><strong>rat guard</strong>: Miley. You got a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: …Kitty?!?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I’m so sorry, Stu. I wanted to tell you what
was going on. I really, really liked you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Kitty…my situation is really not important. The
thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a
demented monkey.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: You’re such a beautiful man. Look at you -
stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her
what Monkeybone is up to??</p>
<p><strong>rat guard</strong>: Time’s up! Break it up, you two.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: No! Give me a moment. Just to look at him.
Oh, Stu. Oh, my sweet, sweet Stu.</p>
<p><strong>rat guard</strong>: Feeding time!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just
kills me!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m heading in to work, baby. Are you sure
you’ll be okay?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Oh yeah. There’s just one thing I don’t
get. “Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma” that’s a big story! That’s
front page news! But I can’t find a word of coverage in this stinkin’
rag! Hey. Don’t I have a TV show?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: They only made the one episode. They’ve shown
it about nineteen times.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: I need a new PR guy.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Yes, being in a coma taught Stu Miley a
thing or two about life. Buckle your seat belts, for one. But seriously,
Stu Miley is a different man today. I’m much homier.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: And speaking of which, here’s the light of
my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I had to park two blocks away. Is something
-</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I took the liberty of calling a little press
conference. We’re on TV, so don’t say “shit.” Shit! I said it. Shit! I
said it again!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Stu, what is it about Monkeybone that
makes him so popular?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Well, it’s partly that he punctures all
the phony pretensions of our modern society…and it’s partly that he’s a
breathtakin’, heartbreakin’, rump-shakin’ sex machine! Ask these
gentlemen here. They’re an important cog in my media machine. They’ll be
doing six new episodes of the Monkeybone show under my personal
supervision.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: It’s all synergy. The show synergizes the
strip, which synergizes the merchandising, which synergizes the
religion, which synergizes the Barbara Walters special; and then, baby,
we are all in the United Empire of Monkeybonia.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: I tell you, he’s ready to merchandise. We’ve
gotta move quickly. Get the toy guys, the burger guys, the lunchbox guys
-</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Herb…what in God’s name -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s this about merchandising? You always
hated merchandising!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from
another angle…there’s a potload of money here.</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: You two-bit simian stooge. WHAT THE HELL IS
THIS? We didn’t send you up here to shake your booty and chase broads.
We sent you up to make nightmares!!</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Now find that nightmare juice and get to
work. ’Cause you may be a free man during the day… but when you dream,
your monkey ass is mine!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Eep!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Friggin’ Hypnos. I’ll show him…</p>
<p><strong>female baboon</strong>: Hey, handsome.</p>
<p><strong>female baboon</strong>: Yeah, you. Come here, good-looking.
Why don’t you let me out of this cage?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Hey, I’d love to, baby, but…it’d put me in
hot water.</p>
<p><strong>female baboon</strong>: I know how to be very, very
grateful.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Tell you what, angel. When you get out,
give me a call…</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Gettin’ jiggy wit’ it - gettin’ jiggy wit’
it…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu? Is that you? Where did you go?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Baby, don’t lie. I know you went out.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Not me. Nope. You must’ve been
dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re wearing a topcoat, Stu. - Where are
your pants?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Well, Miss Smarty, if I didn’t go out, I
wouldn’t need any pants. Now would I?</p>
<p><strong>burger god rep</strong>: As you know, Burger God has 1700
outlets nationwide…we’re prepared to back a major TV buy to launch our
Mega Monkey Meal. Go ahead. Try a bite.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: I think it’s a pig hair. How much is
McDonald’s offering?</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Less.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Oh, here’s something. The city zoo is kicking
off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you’d be willing to appear
at a benefit.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Well, nothing. It’s a benefit. But we could
probably get People and Entertainment Tonight to cover it.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: I get it. We could give the public the
impression that we were doing something… charitable. Brilliant!!</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: And last…you remember Bill here, from the
Bazoom Toy Company? He’s got a little something I think you’ll like.</p>
<p><strong>bazoom toy rep</strong>: It’s a prototype. Code name “Little
Jack Horner.” Go on - pull out his thumb.</p>
<p><strong>bazoom toy rep</strong>: You know kids - they love anything
gross…</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Kids? Kids?! This is a work of genius.
This is art. This is the answer to all my prayers!</p>
<p><strong>bazoom exec</strong>: Well - I guess…</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Aww righhhhht!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: So here’s my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo
benefit. We get a big pi�ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls -
hundreds of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: A pi�ata. That’s a great idea!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: You guys don’t know it, but you just saved
my ass!</p>
<p><strong>burger god exec</strong>: Interesting fellow.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Head trauma.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: This’ll get him off my back!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: It’s his world - we just live in it.
Monkeybone! Back with six all-new episodes, starting -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The thing is, I’m responsible for the way
he’s acting. It’s the nightmare juice. It’s got to be.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Julie, that stuff probably saved his
life.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I can’t explain this, Alice, but I’m not so
sure it did. It’s as if…he’s not Stu any more. The Stu I love is
gone!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Yeah, baby! Nightmare-in-a-butt!
Okay…guinea pig, guinea pig…</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: C’mere, boy…c’mere, ole buddy…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Listen. Let’s bring him in for some tests. I
guarantee you’re overreacting.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Actually, no, I don’t think I’m
overreacting.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Sweet dreams, you little bastard!</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Dog dreams!! That stinkin’ monkey. I can’t
believe it. We give him a body, and he sends us …dogs.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Let’s not think about dogs. Let’s think about
pussycats. Meeowwwwwwrrrr….</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Shh! You’ll need it when you’re
traveling.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Don’t ask where I got it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You can’t do this! You’ll get in trouble!</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: You’re the only true-hearted man I ever met.
You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How am I gonna get past the guards?</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: I’ll worry about the guards.</p>
<p><strong>kitty</strong>: Go. Just go.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Thanks, Kitty, I’ll never forget you for
th–</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ll really…never…forget you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: “4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation,
prefers to hold eating utensils…with feet. Successfully carves turkey
roll holding eating utensils…with feet.”</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins.
Wires got crossed between hands and feet.</p>
<p><strong>clarissa</strong>: Great lead. I’ll try and find it on the
net.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: “4/18: Subject climbs backyard tree…to
perform elimination. When confronted with product… blames it on family
dog.”</p>
<p><strong>hutch</strong>: Seems perfectly obvious. He’s been possessed
by a monkey!</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: You’re really gonna pop the question?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Got the ring. Got the airline tickets.
Soon as they break that pi�ata, we’ll grab a cab - and it’s off to the
land of palm trees and coconuts.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: I can’t believe you. You used to hate being
the center of attention. Now you’re proposing, in public, at a
benefit.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Yeah, I was thinking…I mean, I’m a
celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand,
if you’re married, they can’t testify against you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hello? Oh, Hutch - what?</p>
<p><strong>hutch</strong>: The Nightmare Juice! It’s gone! Somebody
switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Kool-Aid!? But who’d would want to -</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay. Call the police. I’ll be right
over.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The technical name is Oneirix. It’s an
enzyme. It’s present in the brains of -</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Yeah, yeah…Nightmare juice.</p>
<p><strong>detective ii</strong>: And there’s been no sign of a
break-in?</p>
<p><strong>hutch</strong>: Holy shit…the pants. The janitor found a pair
of torn-up pants. It was the same night the monkey tipped her cage over.
Remember that, Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah…I remember it vividly.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Now, if I may ask - what kind of idiot sneaks
into the Land of Death twice?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re mad at me. Great. You have every right
to be. But we’re both mad at Dark Town. We’re both mad at Hypnos.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Oh, sure. Now you’re gonna tell me it was all
his idea. You were completely innocent -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not going to tell you that. I wanted that
E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I’d stare you right in the face to get it
- and I’d do the same again.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Why??</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I have a girl up there. And I never - I
should’ve - I just want to tell her I love her.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I’m a simple man. I’m just doing my job. I
enjoy</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Death, I’m trying to make things right. Take my
soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Well - you’d need a body.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: If it wasn’t for that comic strip of yours, I
wouldn’t be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by.
That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I
thought I would die.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Coming from you, that’s quite a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: De nada. Now, come here…bend over…before I
change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Bend over?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Okay…detaching the left kidney…</p>
<p><strong>organ donor</strong>: What the - who the hell am I??</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: You’re an organ donor!</p>
<p><strong>organ donor</strong>: Am I dead?!?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: The chute didn’t open. We kind of assumed
-</p>
<p><strong>organ donor</strong>: I need this body. Just for a few
minutes. I’ll bring it back, okay?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Might have someone take a look at that.</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: Oh. Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lead surgeon</strong>: I think it can still be saved. Put it
on ice.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Whatever he’s done, I’m responsible for
it.</p>
<p><strong>clarissa</strong>: That’s not true, Julie. It’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: This is not about your guilt, Julie. There
could be innocent people in danger.</p>
<p><strong>clarissa</strong>: He’s not the same guy. He’s not your Stu.
I didn’t want to tell you this, but the other day he pinched me on the
butt.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I didn’t want to tell you this, but the other
day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you have to tell the
police.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Tell them what? I don’t know anything
concrete. All I have is a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>clarissa</strong>: Oh my God, we’ve got a flasher.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That…that’s Herb!</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They’re working
together. All of them. Shirts…pants…</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Did you see a corpse running this way?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: As emcee I want to thank you all for
joining us at this swingin’ bash…it’s a special night for the birds, and
the lions, and the monkeys, but it’s also a special night for - - this
monkey. And it’s special because of a very special lady. Her name is -
Julie McElroy. Just kiddin’, Julie. Stand up.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: And to make this special night
extra-special, I’d like to do a special number…especially for you.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: I am just a Monkey Man! I’m glad you are a
monkey…woman…too.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: We’ll hop a plane tonight. An island
ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It looks so…new.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: It is new. Why wouldn’t it be new?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother’s
ring…</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Heirloom? Huh? You want a used ring -
?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Ju-leeee… Operators are standing by… Offer
expires at midnight, December 31…</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What’d that
creep call you - ?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He called me “Doc.”</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: That’s me, folks! Monkeybone! Let’s
party!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Please. Where did you take that man…?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Who are you? Why did you say those
things?</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: Oh, Doc, it’s all a mixup. We were in the
land of death. He stole my e-ticket. That’s how he got my body, see? All
they had left for me was this corpse!</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: Don’t walk away, Doc! He’s only here to
give people nightmares!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stu…how?</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: I had to come back, Julie. I had to give
you this.</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: I meant to give it to you before. The
night we crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I…try to remember me like that,
okay? Not like this.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: I’m crying too. I just don’t have any
tears. I’m all dried up.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Detective, please let this man out of the
van.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Okay, folks, it’s pi�ata time - you know
the rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it’s all for the benefit of
our friends the animals! Oooooh! This one’s on me!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Choke up, baby. That’s right. Choke
up!</p>
<p><strong>organizer</strong>: I don’t understand, officer. This is a
benefit. Surely this can wait until -</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Sorry, ma’am…we need to question Mr. Miley on a
most urgent matter.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been
tampered with. They’re toxic!</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: I mean it this time. Back in the pack.</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Stu…I can explain…I was sick of being a
figment, see? It’s awful being a figment. It’s degrading! And I never
really wanted to give people nightmares. I just told ’em that so they’d
help me get a body.</p>
<p><strong>o.d. stu</strong>: Yeah - my body. Back in the pack, you
simian shitbird!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Ma’am, can you give me some idea of what’s
going on here?</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Laugh, damn you…laugh at the sidekick…the
happy little monkey. He doesn’t have any feelings. He’s just a figment
of your immagination!</p>
<p><strong>stu-bone</strong>: Let…go…you…dingleberry…</p>
<p><strong>head surgeon</strong>: Put it on ice. I think it can still be
saved!</p>
<p><strong>head surgeon</strong>: Put it on ice. I think it can still be
saved.</p>
<p><strong>head surgeon</strong>: Put him on ice. I think he can still
be saved!</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Not again. THAT STINKING MONKEY!!!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I think I can bring ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I dress up when I want to make an impression.
- So how’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye,
everything’s gonna be okay. I guess I’m yours now.</p>
<p><strong>monkeybone</strong>: Death, I’d like to point out that none
of this was my fault. The roots of this tragedy go back to a callous,
uncaring society that -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey. Where’s Monkeybone?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Back in your head, where he belongs. No
offense, Stu, but on your own you’re kinda vanilla. I didn’t want to
send you back without him.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Back? You’re sending me back?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: It’s irregular, but…I just love that strip of
yours. I figure I’ll take the “Family Circus” guy instead.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Death! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Thank me next time you see me.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Ohhhh, Hypnos??</p>
<p><strong>hypnos</strong>: Death! So nice to see you. I can explain
-</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know what happened. All I know is…he
was in a coma…and then he came back…and now he’s gone again.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Excuse me. We lost a corpse - we saw him
heading this way…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I got a couple of fresh ones in the back.
Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: I’ll be. It’s him all right. Still
dead…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Is it you? Is it really you this time?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, Stu. Tell me I’m not dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Baby…you’re asking the wrong guy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: My tail itches.</p>
