<p><strong>girl</strong>: Now that the war’s over, our soldiers get to
come home, yes?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Some of them. Some will be stationed on the
rim planets as Peace Enforcers.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I don’t understand. Why were the Independents
even fighting us? Why wouldn’t they look to be more civilized?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: That’s a good question. Does anybody want
to open on that?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I hear they’re cannibals.</p>
<p><strong>another boy</strong>: That’s only Reavers.</p>
<p><strong>another girl</strong>: Reavers aren’t real.</p>
<p><strong>another boy</strong>: Full well they are. They attack
settlers from space, they kill them and wear their skins and rape them
for hours and hours –</p>
<p>****: It’s true that there are… dangers on the outer planets. So
let’s follow up on Borodin’s question. With all the social and medical
advancements we can bring to the Independents, why would they fight so
hard against us?</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: We meddle.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: River? RIVER is a dark, intense little
girl, writing with one hand and “typing” with the other. long wooden
stylus and tapping either end down different She is a good two years
younger than the other kids.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: People don’t like to be meddled with. We tell
them what to do, what to think, don’t run don’t walk we’re in their
homes and in their heads and we haven’t the right. We’re meddlesome.</p>
<p>****: River, we’re not telling people what to think. We’re just
trying to show them how. She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the
girl’s forehead</p>
<p><strong>2nd technician</strong>: She’s dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>first technician</strong>: Nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>2nd technician</strong>: Off the charts. Scary monsters.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Let’s amp it up. Delcium, eight-
drop. DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable – nor gradually, for that
matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied with himself.</p>
<p>****: See, most of our best work is done when they’re asleep. We can
monitor and direct their subconscious, implant suggestions… River starts
convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector starts forward, slowly.</p>
<p>****: It’s a little startling to see, but the results are
spectacular. Especially in this case. River Tam is our star pupil. The
Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold, staring at the girl
with no emotion at all. His name, as we will very soon learn, is
SIMON.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ve heard that.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: She’s a genius. Her mental capacity
is extraordinary, even with the side-effects.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Tell me about them.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Well, obviously, she’s unstable… the
neural stripping gives them heightened cognitive reception, but it also
destabilizes their own reality matrix. It manifests as borderline
schizophrenia… which at this point is the price for being truly
psychic.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What use do we have for a psychic if she’s
insane?</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: I don’t have to tell you the
security potential of someone who can read minds. And she has lucid
periods – we hope to improve upon the… I’m sorry, Sir, I have to ask if
there’s some reason for this inspection.</p>
<p>****: Am I making you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject. I was told their support for the
project was unanimous. The demonstration of her power –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: How is she physically?</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Like nothing we’ve seen. All our
subjects are conditioned for combat, but River… she’s a creature of
extraordinary grace.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes. She always did love to dance. He drops
to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>angle: the baton</strong>: As the top pops off like a
bouncing betty , flying up over Simon and River’s heads and then
bursting forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
flowing through the staff’s heads and knocking them out. Simon rushes to
River, gently removes the probes from her head and swabs her,
whispering:</p>
<p>****: River. Wake up. Please, it’s Simon. River. It’s your brother.
Wake up… She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly’s tunic beneath.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Simon. A beat, as they face each other, Simon
fighting emotion.</p>
<p>****: They know you’ve come.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We can’t make it to the surface from inside.
Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at them from
the other side of the doors. 4wo SIMON</p>
<p>****: Find a – But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds herself in a
perfect split, feet against the walls and outstretched hand holding the
sprinkler for support. The doors burst open and two doctors pass by,
hardly noticing the lone orderly. Passing right under River.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of
rolling hills, the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well
hidden. A gurney-sized section of the ship’s belly detaches and drops
down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It comes to Simon
and River and stops suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Get on! He is standing by the window – and
the Security Agent is right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his
might. Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as the
Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up in the gurney,
River on her knees, Simon standing beside her holding one of the cables
–</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Stop. The action freezes.</p>
<p>****: Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack. The action REVERSES, taking us back
to the moment of Simon and River on the gurney just before it rises. f t
o</p>
<p>****: Stop. There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch,
and he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event. The
Government’s man. We’ll just call him THE OPERATIVE. He is thoughtful, a
little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a suit too nondescript to be a
uniform, too neat to be casual wear. He is in:</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Biograph. Simon Tam.</p>
<p>****: Remarkable children. Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men
and a nervous young female intern following. Mathias looks greyer and
more gaunt than when we saw him last.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Excuse me! No one is allowed in the
records room without my express permission.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Enter the doctor. Forgive me. I
prefer to see the event alone, without bias. Mathias looks at the
hologram – realizes which one it is.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: I need to see your clearance.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: You’re right to insist. I know you’ve
had security issues here. He places his hand on a screen as he says it.
Mathias looks at the readout, and drops the bluster.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Apologies. An Operative of the
Parliament will of course have full cooperation. I’m not sure what… I
see no listing of rank, or name.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I have neither. Like this facility, I
don’t exist. The Parliament calls me in when… when they wish they didn’t
have to. Let’s talk about the Tams.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: I assume you’ve scanned the status
logs…</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: River was your greatest success. A
prodigy – A phenomenon. Until her brother walked in eight months ago and
took her from you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: It’s not quite so simple.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I’m very aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: He came in with full creds. He beat
the ap-scan, the retinal… There was no way I could –</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: No, no. Of course. The boy spent his
fortune developing the contacts to infiltrate this place.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Gave up a brilliant future in.
medicine as well, you’ve probably read. Turned his back on his whole
life. Madness.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Madness, no. Something a good deal
more dangerous. Have you looked at this scan carefully? At his face?
Mathias looks uncertain.</p>
<p>****: It’s love, in point of fact. He loved his sister and he knew
she was in pain. So he took her somewhere safe.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I’m here because the situation is
even less simple than you think. Do you know what your sin is,
Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: I. I would be very careful about
what you –</p>
<p>****: It’s pride. He touches the computer screen and the hologramic
image jumps to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Key members of Parliament have
personally observed this subject. I was told their support –</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Key members of Parliament. Key. The
minds behind every diplomatic, military and covert operation in the
galaxy, and you put them in a room with a psychic.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: She was… she read cards, nothing
more.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: It’s come to our attention that River
became much more unstable, more… disturbed, after you showed her off to
Parliament. Did she see something very terrible in those cards?</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Whatever… secrets she might have
accidentally gleaned… it’s probable she doesn’t even know she knows
them. That they’re buried beneath –</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: But they are in her. Her mind is
unquiet. It’s the will of the Parliament that I kill her. And the
brother. Because of your sin.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: You know, in certain older civilized
cultures, when men failed as entirely as you have, they would throw
themselves on their swords.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: Well, unfortunately I forgot to
bring a sword to – The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his
sword.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: The Parliament has no further
interest in psychics. They represent a threat to the harmony and
stability of our Alliance.</p>
<p><strong>doctor mathias</strong>: I would put that down right now if I
were you.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Would you be killed in your sleep,
like an ailing pet? Whatever your failings, I believe you deserve better
than that. The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
with true grace, thrusting at the second as he’s pulling out his gun and
pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent reflexively squeezes the
trigger, shooting his own arm. The Operative pulls out the sword and the
agent falls as quietly as the first. Mathias bolts but the Operative
pins him to the wall. He bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the
Doctor’s spine. Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile. The
Operative steps back, observes the Doctor’s rigid grimace for a moment.
Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and holds the blade out to
one side, hilt to the floor and point tilted toward the doctor. The
Doctor stares at it in horror as his paralyzed body begins to tip over
toward it. The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the
door.</p>
<p>****: Young miss, I’ll need all the logs- on behavioral modification
triggers. We’ll have to reach out to River Tam, and help her to come
back to us. No matter how far out Simon has taken her, we can – He’s
almost startled when the Doctor’s body drops into frame, slowed suddenly
by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the Doctor unable to cry out,
as the Operative whispers to him:</p>
<p>****: This is a good death. There’s no shame in this, in a man’s
death. A man who’s done fine works. We’re making a better world. All of
them, better worlds. Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out
as the body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:</p>
<p>****: Young miss, I need you to get to work now. I think I may have a
long way to travel.</p>
<p>****: Where are you hiding,,little girl? The noise is sucked suddenly
out of the room as we black out.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What was that? He’s addressing the pilot, WASH.
Flight gear and a hawaiian shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station –
no old soldier, but just as startled.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Whoah! Did you see that – The ship bucks –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Was that the primary buffer panel?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: It did seem to resemble –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Did the Primary Buffer Panel just fall off my
gorramn ship for no apparent reason? Another buck –</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Looks like.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I thought Kaylee checked our entry couplings! I
have a very clear memory of it –</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Yeah well if she doesn’t give us some extra
flow from the engine room to offset the burnthrough this landing is
gonna get pretty interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Define “Interesting”.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: “Oh god, oh god, we’re all gonna die?”</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: This is the Captain. There’s a little problem
with our entry sequence; we may experience slight turbulence and then
explode. Can you shave the vector –</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I’m doing it! It’s not enough. Kaylee!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Just get us on the ground!</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: That part’ll happen, pretty definitely.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: we’re gonna explode? I don’t wanna
explode.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing?
You only got the two arms…</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: I just get excitable as to choice, like to
have my options open.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I don’t plan on any shooting taking place
during this job.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Well, what you plan and what takes place
ain’t ever exactly been similar.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: No grenades. No grenades. First Mate ZOE enters
from the lower level. Her mode of dress and military deference mark her
as a war buddy of Mal’s.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Are we crashing again?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Good to go, sir. Just loading her up. Are those
grenades?</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Cap’n doesn’t want ’em.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We’re robbing the place. We’re not occupying
it. All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Kaylee! He enters:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you
playing at? The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine
room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks and smoke
is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes Mal with a slightly
impatient smile as he stands in the doorway, raising his voice above the
din.</p>
<p>****: We got the Primary Buffer</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Everything’s shiny, Cap’n. Not to fret.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You told me –</p>
<p>****: You told me the entry couplings would hold for another
week!</p>
<p>****: That was six months ago, cap’n.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: My ship don’t crash. If she crashes, you
crashed her.</p>
<p>****: Doctor. Guess I need to get innocked ’fore we hit planetside.
Simon nods, the ship jolting again.</p>
<p>****: Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m not worried.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: This isn’t fear. This is anger.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>: Well, it’s kinda hard to tell the one from
t’other, face like yours.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be
wider.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I’ll look for that next time.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You’re not taking her.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: No no, that’s not a thing I’m interested in
talking over with –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: She’s not going with you. That’s final.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I hear the words “that’s final” come out of
your mouth ever again, they truly will be. This is my boat. Y’all are
guests on it. He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down
to:</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Guests? I earn my passage, Captain –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: And it’s time your little sister learned from
your fine example.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ve earned my passage treating bullet holes,
knife wounds, laser burns…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Some of our jobs are trickier than others –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And you want to put my sister in the middle
of that.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Didn’t say ‘want’. Said ‘will’. It’s one job,
Doc. She’ll be fine. The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most
of the ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: She’s a seventeen year old girl. A mentally
traumatized sevente–</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: She’s a reader. Sees into the truth of things;
might see trouble before it’s coming. Which is of use to me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And that’s your guiding star, isn’t it?
What’s of use.</p>
<p>****: Honestly, doctor, I think we may really crash this time anyway.
Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do you understand what I’ve gone through to
keep River away from the Alliance?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I do, and it’s a fact me and mine have been
courteous enough to keep to our own selves.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Are you threatening to –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I got one purpose here: keep this boat in the
air. I take the jobs I get – which is less and less, case you ain’t been
keeping track. He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.</p>
<p>****: Every year since the war the Alliance pushes just a little
further out towards the rim. Makes it a chore for naughty men like us to
slip about – and keeping you two on board means working twice as hard to
avoid the law. Means turning down a score of honest jobs.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don’t push
me and I won’t push you. Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to
him:</p>
<p>****: Things get gritty I will keep her from the fray, but she’s
coming. Best you get her ready. As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the
Mule, a four-man hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne
and Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.</p>
<p>****: Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this boat out before we get
flattened?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody flies like my
mister. The camera picks up Simon’s feet as they enter foreground on the
catwalk, and track with them to find:</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: River… She’s lying on her side, looking
straight at us. A loose summer dress draped over her small frame.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I know. We’re going for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Now, River, you stay behind the others. If
there’s fighting you drop to the floor or run away. It’s okay to leave
them to die. River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her
brother.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I’m the brains of the operation.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We should hit town right during Sunday worship.
Won’t be any crowds.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll,
this could look to be a sunny day for us.</p>
<p>****: Captain, I’ll ask you one last time…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Doctor, I’m taking your sister under my
protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to
you I will get very choked up. Honestly. There could be tears. He peels
out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him…</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Don’t mind the Captain none, Simon. I know
he’ll look out for her.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s amazing. I bring River all the way out
to the raggedy edge of the ’verse so she can hide from the Alliance by
robbing banks.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: It’s just a little Trading Station. They’ll
be back ’fore you can spit. Not that you spit…</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: What are we hoping to find here that equals
the worth of a turd?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Alliance payroll. There’s peace enforcing
squads stationed all about this quadrant. Can’t use credits out here –
they got to pay their boys in cashy money. Which once a month rests
here.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Something about stealing from the Alliance just
warms a body like whiskey in winter.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Shiny. Let’s be badguys. Mal turns back to
River.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You ready to go to work, darlin’?</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: There’s no pattern to the pebbles here,
they’re completely random. I tried to count them but you drove too fast.
Hummingbird.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Right. Great. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Hands and knees and heads bowed down!
Everybody, now! Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the
others. Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
Mal’s gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very much new in
design. The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside-down –
and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! – bounces his head right off
the floor, knocking him out cold.</p>
<p>****: Y’all wanna be looking very intently at your own belly buttons.
I see a head start to rise, violence is gonna ensue. The guy who rushed
Mal complies along with everyone else. Jayne dumps his catch on the
floor and rips open his dirty shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance
uniform.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Looks like this is the place. He looks up at
Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front door. She does, and River
steps in.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: RIVER’S BARE FEET – walking slowly among the
hunched- over customers as Mal addresses them.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You’ve probably guessed we mean to be thieving
here, but what we are after is not yours. So let’s have no undue
fussing. As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
finding the small vault locked.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: She’s locked up. River suddenly looks around,
perturbed.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: a young tough. River looks up at Zoe,
alarmed, and silently points to the young man. He is slowly reaching for
the weapon in his belt. He finds Zoe’s sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You know what the definition of a hero is? It’s
someone who gets other people killed. You can look it up later. He drops
his weapon, slides it across the floor. Mal moves to the Trade Agent.
Hauls him up, tosses him toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.</p>
<p><strong>trade agent</strong>: This is just a crop moon, don’t think
you’ll find what you –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: 140 The old man punches in the code. What opens
is a tiny wall safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin.
Unimpressive. Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: At last. We can retire and give up this life of
crime. Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming metal and
blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal addresses the Trade
Agent.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Is there a fed down there? Be truthful.</p>
<p>****: Y’all are Browncoats, hey? Fought for independence?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: War’s long done. We’re all just folk now.
Listen up! We are coming down to empty that vault! The voice of a young
Alliance GUARD comes up from below.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You have to give me your authorization
password! Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
the hole. A beat…</p>
<p>****: Okay… Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Repeater.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Did sound summat like gunblast… Maybe you
aught run tell Lawman… She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a
man. Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self-
mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His clothes are
rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness. A blade blurs through
frame…</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: What the hell is up? You all right? What’s
goin’ on? He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Reavers.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Leg’s good, it’ll bleed plenty and we avoid any
necessary organs…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I was thinking more of a graze..</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Well you don’t want it to look like you just
gave up…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Every heist, he’s gotta start yelling my name
–</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Mal! Reavers! The girl’s pitchin’ a fit.
They’re here or they’re comin’ soon. He is already loading up with bags
as Mal thinks quickly.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Get on the mule. pointing to the</p>
<p>****: Does that open from the inside?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Whah -ah- yes…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You get everyone upstairs in there and you seal
it. Long as you got air you don’t open up, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I – Buh I – Mal is in his face, dark and
huge:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Zoe take the wheel –</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: You see ’em? Anybody see ’em? 1J – and jump
on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands River up to Jayne’s
care. As the craft powers up, slowly moving, the young man Zoe kept from
trying to pull his weapon bursts out of the station, grabbing the back
of the mule.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Take me with you!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Get in the vault with the others –</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I can’t stay here! Please!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It’s too many. Drive, Zoe. A Reaver craft ROARS
over their heads. It’s nearly the size of Serenity. Torn apart, belching
smoke – a welded conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war.
Predator, pure. It disappears over the rooftops.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Drive! Zoe’s face is set with unhappy
determination as she floors it, shooting out and leaving the young man
in the dust. As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun. He nudges a
lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back. Mal fires twice. The
young man takes both bullets in the chest, slumps down dead.</p>
<p><strong>angle: the edge of town</strong>: As the mule shoots past the
last building, we see a skiff shoot out from behind the buildings of the
adjacent street, right abreast of our gang.</p>
<p><strong>angle: the center of town</strong>: We see the church as the
first ship and an even larger one come to hover over it, Reavers
dropping down on cable lines to swarm into it.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: How come they ain’t blowing us out of the
air?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: They wanna run us down. The up- close kill.
River is squashed down on her back, being very small.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: They want us alive when they eat us.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Boy, sure would be nice if we had some
grenades, don’tchya think? Mal says nothing, keeps firing.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Wash, baby can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: We’re moments from air. You got somebody
behind you? We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Reavers.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We’re not gonna reach you in time.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Just keep moving, honey. We’re coming to
you.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Grab on! Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling,
pulled out between the two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his
pistol.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: I won’t get et! You shoot me if they take me!
Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne –</p>
<p>****: Well don’t shoot me first!</p>
<p><strong>v0v</strong>: The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the
ground. Mal hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make
room.</p>
<p>****: Rutting pigs! Where’s – And River is holding out his weapon
before he can ask for it.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Get some distance on ’em. You come to the
flats, I want you to swing round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: J Simon! Open the loading dock!</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Okay, baby, we’ve talked this through…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Talkin’ ain’t doin’. She throws the wheel and
the mule comes hard about, fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming
skiff.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Don’t slow down!</p>
<p><strong>angle: the skiff</strong>: As it heads for the mule –</p>
<p><strong>angle: the mule</strong>: As it heads for the skiff – and
Serenity swoops down out of the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up
behind it – The Mule swallowed by the bigger ship –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: River?</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I swallowed a bug. Kaylee runs in to see how
everyone is. She goes to Simon.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Is he okay? A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame
from under the skiff-top. He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth –
Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe both fire at
the same time. The freak takes too long to go down, but down he goes.
Dies sitting against the s i op. 4 Everybody takes a moment to look at
each other.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: We all here? What’s going on? Hello? r./ ZOE
No casualties. Anybody following?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Nice flying, baby, and that’s a negative.
Clean getaway – Out of atmo in six minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Set course for Beaumonde. First thing, I want
these bod – Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to
stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You stupid, selfish, son of a whore —</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I’m a hair’s breadth from riddling you with
holes, Doctor –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: “One simple job! She’ll be fine!”</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: She IS fine! Except for bein’ still crazy,
she’s the picture of health!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Wasn’t for River, we’d probably be left there.
She felt ’em coming.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Never again. You understand me?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Seems I remember a talk about you giving orders
on my boat.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well sleep easy ’cause we’re off your boat.
Just as soon as River gets her share of the “bounty”.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Well let’s not do anything hasty…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: No, shiny! I’m sick a’ carrying tourists
anyhow. We’ll be on Beaumonde in ten hours time, you can pick up your
earnings and be on your merry. Meantime you do your job. Patch up my
crew. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: He didn’t lie down. They never lie down. She
is looking at the Reaver. Everyone does, for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No, I think things’ll glide a deal smoother for
us without River and Simon on board… but how long do you think they’ll
last?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Doc made his call. They’s as babes in a basket
when we took ’em in; we sheltered ’em plenty. Man has to cut loose,
learn to stand on his own.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Like that man back in town? They stop by Mal Is
room.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I had to shoot him. What the Reavers woulda
done to him before they killed him…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I know. That was a piece a’ mercy. But before
that, him begging us to bring him along… vo,</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: We couldn’t take the weight. Woulda slowed us
down.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You know that for certain</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Mule won’t run with five. I shoulda dumped the
girl? Or you? Or Jayne?</p>
<p>****: Well, Jayne…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Coulda tossed the payload.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our
mitts, tell ’em “here’s your share”? They’d set the dogs on us in the
space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril. We get a job,
we gotta vo make good. Washenters from the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Sir, I don’t disagree on any particular point,
it’s just… in the time of war, we woulda never left a man stranded.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Maybe that’s why we lost. She’s not happy with
the reply. Mal climbs down to his room as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his
arms around her.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Kaylee, are you ever gonna put that capture
down?</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: We gotta have records of everything. A bona
fide Companion entertained clients on this very ship! In this very bed!
The picture pans over to the bed – which River is bending over and
sniffing curiously. Inara is packing things up.</p>
<p>****: For one sweet second, we was almost classy.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: 4 You promised to help me pack.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Honest, Inara, why do you have to leave?
Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera – and the picture freezes,
goes back to the beginning. During all this, Mal has picked it up. He
looks at it a moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: I do not get it. How’s a guy get so
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Ain’t logical. Cuttin’ on his own face,
rapin’ and murdering – I mean, I’ll kill a man in a fair fight… or if I
think he’s gonna start a fair fight, or if he bothers me, or if there’s
a woman, or I’m gettin’ paid – mostly only when I’m gettin’ paid. But
these Reavers… last ten years they just show up like the boageyman from
stories. Eating people alive? Where does that get fun? He dumps the body
in, she starts the doors closing.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Shepherd Book said they was men that reached
the edge of space., saw a vasty nothingness and just went bibbledy over
it.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Hell, I been to the edge. Just looked like
more space.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: I don’t know. People get awful lonely in the
black. Like to get addlepated ourselves, we stay on this boat much
longer. Captain’ll drive us all off, one by one.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: You’re just in a whinge cuz that prissy doc
is finally disembarking. Me I says good riddance. He never belonged
here, and his sister’s no saner than one of them Reavers.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: That ain’t even so! River’s a dear heart and
a boon to this crew! You just don’t like her ’cause she can read your
mind and everything you think is mean.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Well, there is that.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Her and Simon could have a place here. Now
they’re leaving us. Just like Shepherd Book. She looks up toward one of
the shuttles.</p>
<p>****: Just like Inara…</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: They love you.</p>
<p><strong>sheydra</strong>: The girls. They’ve learned more from you
these last months than the rest of us could show them in two years.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: They’re very sweet. But they’re not
Companions.</p>
<p>****: You’ve no hope for them? Junk the lot, start anew?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: On Sihnon we started training at twelve.
Years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure
was even mentioned. Most of these girls –</p>
<p><strong>sheydra</strong>: They’re all of good family, the highest
academic standards –</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Control. Was the first lesson. And the last
and these worlds are not like the Central Planets. There is barbarism
dressed up in the most civil weeds. Men of the highest rank who don’t
know the difference between a Companion and a common whore. It’s
unsafe.</p>
<p><strong>sheydra</strong>: All the more reason the girls look to you.
You came out here alone, before the Alliance ever thought to establish a
House this remote. You’ve seen so much. You’re a figure of great romance
to them. 4d INARA Great romance has nothing to do with being a
Companion, Sheydra. You should know better.</p>
<p><strong>sheydra</strong>: I’m not the one who had a torrid affair
with a pirate. Inara nearly spills her drink.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: A who? With a what?</p>
<p>****: It’s the talk of the House. The girls all trade stories in the
dorms at night.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I didn’t… have a pirate…</p>
<p><strong>sheydra</strong>: In one of the stories you make love in a
burning temple. I think that’s my favorite.</p>
<p>****: This is unbearable. Captain Reynolds is no pirate; he’s a petty
thief. And he never laid a finger on me. All he ever did was rent me a
shuttle and be very annoying.</p>
<p><strong>sheydra</strong>: A year on his shuttle and he never laid a
finger on you. No wonder you left.</p>
<p>****: I left because – go away. We’re no longer friends. You’re a
stranger to me now.</p>
<p><strong>sheydra</strong>: 104 I do love to watch you boil. Don’t
worry. The stories will fade. And your Captain Reynolds has probably
gotten himself blown up by this time.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Yes. That would be just like him.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Don’t talk to the barkers – only the
captains.</p>
<p><strong>40 simon</strong>: • I wish there was… Since he doesn’t know
what to say, she rattles on:</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: You shouldn’t aughta be so clean. It’s a
dead giveaway you don’t belong, you always gotta be tidy. Don’t pay
anybody in advance. And don’t ride in anything with a Capissen 38
engine, they fall right out of the sky.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Kaylee. She turns and heads off. Simon starts
in the other direction, but River looks after her and the others.</p>
<p>****: River… do you want to stay with them?</p>
<p><strong>4 river</strong>: It’s not safe.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No, I fear it’s not safe anymore. He’s
heading off and doesn’t hear:</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: For them.</p>
<p><strong>newsperson</strong>: that it was a band of Reavers remains
unconfirmed. The only survivors of the massacre apparently locked
themselves in the Trade Station vault until –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It’s not my fault the Doc’s got no stomach for
Rim living –</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: It is entirely and for all your fault! If
you’d given Simon a moment, just a moment where he didn’t think you were
gonna throw them off or turn them in, he might’ve –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What? Swept you into his cleanly arms? Made
tidy love to you? They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash
have already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat: Mal
sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit – the q0 drawer closes and
rotates, revealing another empty one. A large bouncer with a shockrod
watches impassively.</p>
<p>****: Don’t you dare joke! You know how much I pined on Simon. And
him fair sweet on me, I well believe, but he’s so worried about being
found out –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Captain didn’t make ’em fugitives.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: But he coulda made ‘em family! Steada
driving them off. Steada keeping Simon from seein’ I was there, when I
carried such a torch and we coulda – goin’ on a year now I ain’t had
nothin’ twixt my nethers weren’t run on batteries!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Oh god! I can’t know that!</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: 40 I could stand to hear a little more…</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: If you had a care for anybody’s heart you
woulda –</p>
<p>****: You knew he was gonna leave. We never been but a way station to
those two. And how do you know what he feels? He’s got River to worry on
but he still coulda shown you… if I truly wanted someone bad enough,
wouldn’t be a thing in the ’verse could stop me from going to her.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Tell that to Inara. For a moment, Mal is too
shocked to react. Kaylee storms out.</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: 4 Domestic troubles? MINGO is young, tough –
somewhere between a gangster and a fur-trader. Sounds lower-class
British, or something like it.</p>
<p><strong>fanty</strong>: Domestic troubles? FANTY moves out from
behind Mingo to reveal that he is Mingo’s identical twin. Apart from
slight differences in dress, they are indistinguishable.</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: ’Cause we don’t wanna interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>fanty</strong>: A man should keep his house in order.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Mingo. Fanty.</p>
<p>****: He’s Mingo. ,do</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: He’s Fanty. You’re Mingo.</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: Ghahh! How is it you always know?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Fanty’s prettier. Feel to do some business?</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: Bit crowded, isn’t it? As you see, we come
unencumbered by thugs.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Which means at least four of the guys already
in here are yours. All’s one. I’ll just keep Jayne with me.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Sir, are you sure you don’t –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Go. Go get yourselves a nice romantic meal.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Those are my two favorite words! Honey…
“Meal…”</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It’s business. We’re fine. They leave and the
four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a few coins to a saloon-girl, who
does a little fan-dance…</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: THE CORVUE CAMERA’S POV of the men is
conveniently blocked by her little dance. Mal’s foot nudges a duffel bag
of money to Mingo’s foot.</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: Quite a crew you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Yeah, they’re a fine bunch of ruebens.</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: How you keep them on that crap boat is the
subject of much musing tween me and Fanty.</p>
<p><strong>fanty</strong>: We go on and on.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: So I’m noticing. Is there a problem I don’t
know of? You got 25% of a sweet take kissing your foot, how come we’re
not dispersing?</p>
<p><strong>fanty</strong>: Our end is forty, precious.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: My muscular buttocks it’s forty –</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: It is as of now. Find anyone around going
cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>j fanty</strong>: Find anyone around going near a sorry lot
like you in the first instance.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: RIVER has entered, is looking about. Jayne
sees her, nudges Mal, who looks and turns back to business. We stay on
her as she wanders around the perimeter of the bar, vaguely listening in
on Mal’s deal.</p>
<p>****: You’re unlikable, Mal. You got no respect for us above you, you
got enemies in every quadrant, and your ship’s older than the starting
point of time. You’s charity cases to such as us.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Well here’s a foul thought. I conjured you two
were incompetent; sent us out not knowing there were V0 Reavers about.
Now I’m thinking you picked us out because you did.</p>
<p><strong>mingo</strong>: That were a sign of faith, boy. And it
doesn’t affect our forty per. Danger is, after all, your business.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Reavers ain’t business, double dickless. This
is all background noise to River, who has moved to the CV screen, on
which is a commercial. It’s animated, goofy, cartoon animals and
anime-style Asian girls all transforming to insane fantasy figures as
they sing about:</p>
<p><strong>fruity, oaty bars.</strong>: We push in, the light from the
CV on River’s face, pushing to EXTREME CLOSE UP, all noise but the
jingle fading out, finally that as well, just the hum in River’s ears.
And she whispers:</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Miranda. She turns and looks back at the
crowd. What happens next happens very fast. She strides silently to the
first table – two men drinking quietly – and she slams her foot into
one’s face, then whips it back into the other’s, knocking them both
unconscious as – people are turning, just registering that this girl –
kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a bottle off it
behind her – the bottle hits a man behind her square in the face, a man
she never even looked at – people are rising, fleeing or pushing forward
–</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: River…</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: V0 Whuhuh? She’s taking out a group of four,
high kicks and perfect precision – Two men come from either side, one
whipping out a knife – she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
her head, using his momentum to stab the other one – Mal fights to get
back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches her and she wrests his shockrod
from him, uses it on him, on Fanty and Mingo – the fan-dancer is bolting
and River hurls the rod at her head, knocks her cold… She’s everywhere.
On tables, chairs, under your legs, using the room itself to take out
every single person there. One man hides behind a wall – impossibly, she
swings her leg around the corner and nails his face. Jayne grabs her
from behind –</p>
<p>****: Gorrammit, girl, it’s me! She grabs his crotch and squeezes –
his grip loosens and she spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with
her palm, V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
of another while she cracks Jayne’s head with a small table – Somebody
pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to scream out even
before he shoots himself in the gut – Mal frantically wrests a gun from
the vending locker as River knocks the other guy’s gun in the air, kicks
someone else and then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up
with his, they are pointed right at each other –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Eta Kooram Nah Smech! And River drops to the
ground, fast asleep. There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and
Simon, who has run up to the entrance, are the only ones standing. He
looks down at River. She lies unconscious, helpless.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I think maybe we ought to leave.</p>
<p>****: Hello again. Yes, it’s me. I’m glad you’ve finally asked for
me. An Ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor:</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: We got a pos on a retinal – man carrying her
out is Malcolm Reynolds, captains a Firefly-class transport ship,
“Serenity”. Bound by law five times, smuggling, tariff dodge… not
convicted. Nothing here that would –</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: The ship. The name of the ship.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong>: Crossref. Malcolm Reynolds. Serenity. He looks
over at the Ensign with a small, strange smile on his lips – as his
glasses are covered by text.</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Serenity Valley. Bloodiest battle of
the entire war. The Independents held the valley for seven weeks, two of
them after their high command had surrendered. 68% casualty rate.</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Of course, Sir, I just didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>140</strong>: If the feds ever bothered to crossref justice
files with war records… Yes. Our Mr. Reynolds was a sergeant, 57th
Overlanders. Volunteer. Fought at Serenity till the very last. This man
is an issue. This man hates us.</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: First Mate Zoe Washburn, formerly Corporal
Zoe Alleyne, also in the 57th. Career army, looks like.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: She’s followed him far… Give me the
crew, registered passengers – Our Captain is a passionate man, no room
there for subtlety. He’s bound to have some very obvious…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE LENS of his glasses. On it is a slowly
moving picture of INARA.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: -40 .weakness…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: May I see her?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: She’s still napping just now. And I believe
you’ve got some storytelling to do.</p>
<p>****: We’re out of atmo, plotted for Haven. No one following as of
yet.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Haven? We’re gonna see Shepherd Book?</p>
<p>****: We got to lay low. And I could fair use some spiritual guidance
right about now. I am a lost lamb; what in hell happened back there?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked
out by a ninety pound girl. ’Cause I don’t think that’s ever getting
old.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Do we know if anyone was killed?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It’s likely. I know she meant to Ad kill me
’fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work
anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Safeword.</p>
<p>****: The people who helped me break River out – they had intel that
River and the other subjects were being embedded with behavioral
conditioning. They taught me a safeword, in case… something
happened.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Not sure I get it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A phrase that’s encoded in her brain, that
makes her fall asleep. If I speak the words, “Eta –</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Well don’t say it! moo ZOE It only works on
her, Jayne.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Oh. Well, now I know that.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: “In case something happened.”</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You feel to elaborate on what that something
might be? I mean they taught you that fancy safeword, they must’ve
figured she was gonna, what – start uncontrollably crocheting?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: They never said what –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: And you never did ask. Mal grabs him and throws
him against the wall, in his face.</p>
<p>****: Eight months. Eight months you had her on my boat knowing full
well she might go monkeyshit at the wrong word and you never said a
thing –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I brought her out here so they couldn’t get
to her, I don’t even know how they –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: My ship. My crewi You had a gorramn timebomb
living with us!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What if she went off in the middle woo of
dinner, or in bunk with Kaylee, did that give you a moment’s pause?
Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal’s words hitting him.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I thought she was getting better.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: And I thought they was gettin’ off! Didn’t we
have a intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore?</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: We couldn’t leave them now…</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: No, now that she’s a… killer woman we ought
be bringin’ ’em tea and dumplings! In earnest, Mal: why’d you bring her
back on?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: May I see her. Mal steps aside. Simon enters
the locker.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: She goes woolly again, we’re gonna have to
put a bullet to her.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It’s crossed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Can I make a suggestion that doesn’t involve
violence, or is this the wrong crowd?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Honey…</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: V0 Fanty and Mingo might be coming hard down
on us, or the laws… or maybe nobody could be bunged about a little
social brawl. We need to get our bearings. I think we need to talk to
Mr. Universe.</p>
<p><strong>a0</strong>: As he watches the security feed of River’s fight
his image becomes a vidscreen. He’s addressing Wash, Mal and Zoe. We
intercut between the two spaces:</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: Oh, this is good. This is…</p>
<p>****: .she’s beating up all the burly men and I’m having a catharsis,
it’s happening right now, you guys always bring me the very best
violence. You think you’re in a hot place?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: That’s what we’re looking to learn. Is there
any follow up, a newswave…</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: There is no “news”, there’s the truth
of the signal, what I see, and there’s the puppet theatre the V0
Parliament’s jesters foist on the somnambulant public. Monkey taught to
say the word “monkey” – lead story on 32 planets. But the slum riots on
Hera, not a –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What about this? Did this make the… puppet
theatre?</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: No sir. And no lawforce flags, either –
I hadda go into the security feed direct…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You can do that?</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: Can’t stop the signal, Mal. Everything
goes somewhere and I go everywhere. Security feeds are a traipse to
access – and I wasn’t the first one in, this has prints on it – oh! Look
at her go! A0 Everyone is getting bruises and contusions.
Contoooosions.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: So somebody else has been fed this. That
doesn’t like me too well.</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling in
love with me. You’re just gonna embarrass yourself. I have a commitment
to my Lovebot, it was a very beautiful ceremony, Lenore wrote her own
vows, I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby. And she falls asleep.
Which, she would be sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her
’fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her… Mr Universe
works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on River coming up to it,
looking at it. She whispers the word, “Miranda”, and starts to move
away.</p>
<p>****: Miranda…? Go back further.</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: No.. He pulls another screen close,
starts working that one. Matching timecodes, he pulls up the
commercial.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Um… please? Mr Universe has a third screen
showing the commercial as</p>
<p>****: well – and it starts breaking down, bursts of code showing
through. As he does so:</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: Friends and potential lovers, I</p>
<p><strong>4do</strong>: have good news and I have the other kind. Good
is you’re very smart. Someone is talking to her.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: The oaty bar?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Subliminal. It’s a subliminal message
broadwaved to trigger her.</p>
<p>****: I been seeing this code pop up all over, last few weeks. And I
cannot crack it. It’s Alliance and it’s high military, so here then is
the bad. Someone has gone to enormous trouble to find your little
friend. And found her they have. Mal, Zoe and Wash look at each
other.</p>
<p>****: Do you all know what it is you’re carrying?</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: They’re afraid of me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: They should be. What I will show them… Oh
God… She starts tearing up, breathing faster… Simon runs his hands
through her hair.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Show me off like a dog, old men covered in
blood, it never touched them but they’re drowning in it… so much loss… I
don’t know what I’m saying. I never know what I’m saying…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You said something. When you were triggered,
do you remember? The Captain saw you say something on the feed…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Ask her. She’ll show you all.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Show us what? Who is Miranda?</p>
<p>****: Am I… talking to Miranda now? Nw� She shoots him a look.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I’m not a multiple, dumbo.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. Right. But I think somehow when they
triggered you it brought this up, this memory –</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: It isn’t mine. The memory. I didn’t bring it
and I shouldn’t have to carry it, it isn’t mine.</p>
<p>****: Don’t make me sleep again.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Put a bullet to me. Bullet in the brain pan,
squish.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Don’t say that. Not ever. We’ll get through
this. She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Things are going to get much much worse.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, the Captain hasn’t tossed us in the
airlock, so I’d say we’re –</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: He has to see. More than anyone… he has to
see what he doesn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: River. What will Miranda show us. She
thinks.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Death.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Whose death? And she starts laughing. Quietly
at first, then louder, then almost uncontrollably, screaming in his
face:</p>
<p><strong>smash cut to:</strong>: Black Silence.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Lord, I am walking your way.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: THE RAMP lowers to reveal Shepherd BOOK, a
working- class preacher and former crew member. He smiles as they come
out to meet him:</p>
<p>****: Let me in, for my feet are sore, my clothes are ragged.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A CANNON mounted at the edge of town. The
guy manning it sees them arrive, also goes to greet them.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Look in my eyes, Lord, and my sins will play
out on them as on a screen. Read them all.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Forgive what you can, and send me on my path.
I will walk on, until you bid me rest.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Hope that ain’t for me, Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: It’s prayer for the dead.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Then I really hope it ain’t for me.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: It’s for the men River might have killed in
that bar.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Weren’t River that did it, you know that.
Somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take,
fenced it right Vd up.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You got a plan?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Hiding ain’t a plan?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: It’ll do you for a spell, and the folks
here’ll be glad of the extra coin…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: .but they’ll be coming. Alliance is after this
girl with a powerful will. I look to hear the tromp of their boots any
moment.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You won’t. This isn’t a palms-up military MW
run, Mal. No reports broadwaved, no warrants… much as they want her,
they want her hid. That means Closed File. Means an Operative, which is
trouble you’ve not known.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I coulda left her there.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I had an out – hell, I had every reason in the
’verse to leave her lay and haul anchor.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Not your way, Mal.</p>
<p><strong>v0 mal</strong>: I have a way?</p>
<p>****: Is that better than a plan?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You can play the thug all you want, but
there’s more to you than you’re ever like to ’fess.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You just think that ’cause my eyes is all
sorrowful and pretty.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Only one thing is gonna walk you through this,
Mal. Belief.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd. I ain’t
looking for help from on high. That’s a long wait for a train don’t
come.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: When I talk about belief, why do you always
assume I’m talking about God? W They’ll come at you sideways. As he
continues, we see:</p>
<p><strong>book w.</strong>: It’s how they think: sideways. It’s how
they move. Sidle up and smile, hit you where you’re weak.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Sorta man they’re like to send believes hard.
Kills and never asks why.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It’s of interest to me how much you seem to
know about that world.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I wasn’t born a Shepherd, Mal.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Have to tell me about that some time.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: No I don’t. He walks away, offering this:</p>
<p>****: Sideways. Mal watches him go, thinking.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: River? Eight-year-old River is working
away, not paying attention.</p>
<p>****: River, you look tired. I think everybody’s a little tired by
now; why don’t we all lie down. River looks up, scared. All the other
children wordlessly get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to
them.</p>
<p>****: A little peace and quiet will make everything better. She
starts to lie down herself, right on the grass.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: No… Vao TEACHER River. Do as you’re told.
It’s going to be fine. Lie down.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Whuh huh nuhwhat?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Mal! You up? Got a wave. I’m a bounce it down
to you. He pops up, turns to the screen as the white noise becomes:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Inara.</p>
<p><strong>reverse on</strong>: Inara on Mal’s screen. We see her from
about chest level up. She, presumably, sees the same.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Good as any.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Please tell me you’re wearing pants.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Naked as the day I come cryin’. How’s your
world?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Cold. It’s autumn here.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Still at the Training House?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Right where you left me.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I remember it as nice enough. picturesque.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: It is that. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>ons</strong>: Still flying. So what occasi the wave? Not that
to see you ain’t… well you look very</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Oh. Thank you, I… I guess we have something
of a problem here. With the locals, I thought maybe…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You could use a gun hand?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I’m hoping not. But if you were close at all,
you – the crew – could take your ease here a while… and there’d be
payment…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Payment is never not a factor. I could sound
out the crew… This pot like to boil over soon?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Soon. Not right away.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Well, it would be, I mean I would like to…
Kaylee’s been missing you something fierce –</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Oh they’re so pathetic!</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I miss her too. I even miss my shuttle,
occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Yeah, you left a… got some of your stuff in a
trunk, never did get a chance to drop it off.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I didn’t look through the… stuff… just sundries
I expect.</p>
<p>****: Well, it’s kind of late where I’m at. I’ll send a wave as soon
as I can.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Thank you. She disappears. Mal thinks a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Inara. Nice to see her again.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: So, trap?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Trap.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We goin’ in? moo MAL It ain’t but a few hours
out…</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Yeah, but, remember the part where it’s a
trap?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: If that’s the case, then Inara’s already caught
in it. She wouldn’t set us up willing. Might be we got a shot at seeing
who’s turning these wheels. We go in.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: How can you be sure Inara don’t just wanna
see you? Sometimes people have feelings – I’m referring here to
people…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Y’all were watching, I take it. Guilty
glances.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: 140 You see us fight?</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Trap.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: We’re about seventy miles from the Training
house. And nobody on radar… if the Alliance is about, they’re laying
low.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: They’re about. Find us a home. I’ll take the
shuttle in closer. Zoe, ship is yours. 4dO He starts out, turns back to
Zoe.</p>
<p>****: Remember: if anything happens to me, or you don’t hear from me
within the hour… you take this ship and you come and rescue me.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: What? And risk my ship?</p>
<p>****: I mean it. It’s cold out there. I don’t wanna get left.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Dear Buddha, please send me a pony, and a
plastic rocket, and –</p>
<p><strong>i nar.a</strong>: Mal! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You invited me.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I never thought for a second you’d be stupid
enough to come!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Well that makes you kind of a tease, doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: You knew my invitation wasn’t on the level
–</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Which led me to the conclusion that you must be
in some trouble.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I’m fine! I’m. giddy.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: For a woman schooled in telling men what they
wanna hear, you ain’t much of a liar.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Mal, you cannot handle this man.</p>
<p>****: I have to say, I’m impressed that you would come for her
yourself. lw� And that you would make it this far in that outfit.</p>
<p>****: I can be very graceful when I need to.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I’ve no doubt. Mal sheds his shawl
and robe. Inara kneels at the alter, picks out another incense
stick.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I’m praying for you, Mal.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: That’s very thoughtful. But I mean it
when I say you’re not in any danger.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Speak your piece.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I think you’re beginning to
understand how dangerous River Tam is.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: She is a mite unpredictable. Mood swings, of a
sort.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: It’s worse than you know.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: It usually is.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: That girl will rain destruction down
on you and your ship. She’s an albatross, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Way I remember it, albatross was a ship’s good
luck… til some idiot killed it. Yes, I’ve read a poem. Try not to faint.
The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he moves, Mal
counters.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I’ve seen your war record. I know how
you must feel about the Alliance.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You really don’t.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Fair to say. But I have to hope you
understand you can’t beat us.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I got no need to beat you. I just wanna go my
way.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: And you can do that, once you let me
take the girl back home. Give me the opportunity to help you.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: All I gotta do is let you take one more thing
away from me. I’ve had a lot of things taken in my time. And it may just
be that this is one too many.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: This psychotic, potentially murderous
girl who can’t have the slightest awareness of your protection. This is
where you “draw the line”.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Well I’m a whimsical soul.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: There’s a number of lives that hang
in the balance here. Lives under your care. Are they as whimsical as
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I got no notion that I’m being heroical at all.
Any more than I think you’re really just a harmless bureaucrat come to
help me out. You move like a killer. The Operative is stopped by this.
Unhappily, he continues:</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I have a warship in deep orbit,
Captain. We locked on to Serenity’s pulse beacon the moment you hit
atmo. I can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location
inside of three minutes. Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires
sticking out all around it, and tosses it to the Operative.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You do that, best make peace with your dear and
fluffy lord.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Pulse beacon.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Advice from an old tracker: you J wanna find
someone, use your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: How long do you think you can really
run from us?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. ’Sides, I never credited
the Alliance with an over-abundance of brains. And if you’re the best
they got…</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Captain Reynolds, I should tell you
so that you don’t waste your time: You can’t make me angry.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Oh please. Spend an hour with him. Mal smiles
– then glares at Inara, mouthing “Hey!”</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I need her, Captain. River is… my
purpose and I will gather her to me. The brother as well. Whatever else
happens is incidental. In the greater scheme.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Why is it that the greater scheme always makes
everything not that great?</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I want to resolve this like civilized
men. I’m not threatening you. I’m unarmed.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Great! He draws and shoots the Operative in the
chest. The Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for
the-doorway. The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from
behind.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I am of course wearing full body
armor. I’m not a moron. He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and
blocking a blow from Inara – she is clearly trained in martial arts, but
he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds. Mal is going for his gun
again, turning, and the Operative kicks him in the face, sends him back,
gun flying. Mal gets to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing
hard, nose dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: No back up? We’re making an awful ruckus…</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: They’ll come when they’re needed.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I’d start whistling.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Captain, what do you think is going
to happen here? They come at each other. The Operative is the much
better trained – he’s fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.</p>
<p>****: Nothing here is what it seems.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: He’s not the plucky hero. The
Alliance isn’t some evil empire. This isn’t the grand arena.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: And that’s not incense. He turns to look: the
incense stick burns away – rather like a fuse – and FLASHES in an
explosion of light and sound.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: .I had him…</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I think that I was winning!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light
go out one by one, counting down –</p>
<p><strong>alliance soldier</strong>: Grenade! Everybody dives for
cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara race into the shuttle, Mal
sweeping up the grenade just as the last light goes out and nothing
happens. One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
door shuts on him and Inara.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Hang on to something.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: 4 You sure you remember how it – He nearly
falls over as:</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I told you to hang on.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Forget the pulse beacon, there has to
be another way to track the ship – get a read on the nav sat. It’s a
registered transport, you must be able to locate –</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Have you found a nav sat
trajectory?</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Sir… we’ve found seven. The Operative looks
more unhappy than angry.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Does he think this is a game?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: We have every reason to be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Why, ’cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain’t
so hard –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: He didn’t beat me up –</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Because he’s a believer.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: He’s intelligent, methodical and devout in
his belief that killing River is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I honestly think the only reason we haven’t
been blown out of the air is that he needs to see her.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Needs to see her why?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I’m uncertain. I would say to be sure of the
kill, but… I just know he’ll kill us all to get to her.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: So no hope of a reward, huh?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Did he mention a deal of any kind?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Give the two of them up. Go my way.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Which you was all ready to do not a day ago.
What went sour?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Cutting them loose ain’t the same as handing
them over.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: That so? ’Cause the corpse I’m about to
become is having trouble telling the difference.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Did he say anything about a “Miranda”?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Don’t know who or what, but it’s on River’s
mind. Conjure it might be the reason he’s after her.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: You think maybe it poses some kind of threat
to the Alliance?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Do we care? Are we caring about that?</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: You dumbass hogs, the only people she’s a
threat to is us on this boat!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Look, we get back to Haven in a ’r/ few hours
time –</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Hiding under the Shepherd’s skirts, that’s a
manful scheme –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You wanna run this ship?</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Well you can’t!</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Do a damn sight better job’n you. Getting us
lashed over a couple of strays… No offense, Doc, I think it’s noble as a
grape the way you look to River, but she ain’t my sister and she ain’t
your crew. Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless! So where’s it writ
we gotta lay down our lives for her, which is what you’ve steered us
toward.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I didn’t start this.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: No, the Alliance starts the war – and then
you volunteer. Battle of Serenity, Mal: besides Zoe here, how many – –
I’m talkin’ at you – how many men in your platoon came out of there
alive? Mal stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You wanna leave this room.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: You’re damn right I do. He stalks upstairs.
There’s a quiet moment.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: This isn’t the war, Mal. Mal turns, eyeing
her.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Are you telling me that because you think I
don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: You came to the training house looking for a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I came looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I just want to know who I’m dealing with.
I’ve seen too many versions of you to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I start fighting a war I guarantee you’ll see
something new.</p>
<p><strong>to</strong>: Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara
following, over:</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: We’ll get off. River and I’ll get off at
Haven and find some –</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Nobody’s saying that.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Nobody besides Jayne is saying that.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Mal.</p>
<p>****: I got no answers for you, Inara. I got no rudder. Wind blows 40
northerly, I go north. That’s who I am. Maybe that ain’t a man to lead
but they have to follow so you wanna tear me down do it inside your own
mind.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I’m not trying to tear you down –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: But you fog things up. You always have – you
spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I was.</p>
<p>****: No trouble now, little crazy person… we’re going for a nice</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: shuttle ride – He opens the door and she is on
him in an instant, whip blow to the throat, the nose – he fires wildly
as she jumps on him, wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back
–</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: The other way! Find her and-do not engage!
Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in the
window.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: SIMON’S POV: There is Jayne, not moving – and
River pops up right in front of us. He starts, then waits as she opens
the door.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s gonna be oka – She elbows his throat
viciously. He drops to his knees, shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks
him to the ground. He doesn’t move. She looks at him a moment, then
takes off.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: She’s sealed off the bridge. I do not like her
there.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Cap’n! She tosses him a bolt remover. He
starts pulling a bolt out of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Check the shuttles. She coulda 40 snuck in. He
pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: The government’s man, he says you’re a danger
to us. Not worth helping. Is he right? Are you anything but a weapon?
I’ve staked my crew’s life on the a - person-,– - actual and whole, and
if I’m wrong you’d best shoot me now. Or we could talk more…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Miranda. WIt’s a planet. Matches the one from
her dream.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: How can it be there’s a whole planet called
Miranda and none of us knowed that?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Because there isn’t one. It’s a blackrock.
Uninhabitable. Terraforming didn’t hold, or somesuch. Few settlers
died.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I had to show them. I didn’t know if you were
going to make me sleep.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You could’ve asked…</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years back,
before the war. There was call for workers to settle on Miranda, my
daddy talked about going. I should’ve recalled…</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: But there’s nothing about it on the Cortex –
History, Astronomy… it’s not in there.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Half of writing history is hiding the truth.
There’s something on this rock the Alliance doesn’t want known.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: That’s right at the edge of the Burnham
Quadrant, right?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Whoah, no, no –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: That’s a bad notion –</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Honey…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I got it, baby.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Show them the bad… She hits some commands on
the screen, pulls back to reveal a couple of other planets near
Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: This is us, see? And here’s Miranda. All along
here, this dead space in between, that’s Reaver territory.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: They just float out there, sending out raiding
parties –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Maybe a hundred ships. And more every year. You
go through that you’re signing up to be a banquet.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I’m on board with the run and hide scenario –
and we are just about… He looks at his monitors, looks ahead…</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Shepherd? Shepherd Book! She stops, looking
at the ground by the steeple. There is the body on the ground, face
down. The child she played with at dinner. Kaylee stares, at first
uncomprehending.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: MAL, moving in the other direction,
approaches the cannon, Jayne behind him. He stops and sees: Book, lying
by the cannon, torn up badly from the waist down.</p>
<p><strong>4 mal</strong>: Get the Doc. He moves to the Shepherd, grabs
his searching hand.</p>
<p>****: Shepherd… Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Won’t go far…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Shouldn’t’ve been you. I’m so sorry, it was…
they should’ve hit us. They should’ve hit me.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: That crossed my mind.</p>
<p>****: I shot him down –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I seen.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I killed the ship… that killed us. Not… very
Christian of me.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You did what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Coming from you, that means… almost nothing…
HNAAH! Ah, I’m long gone…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Doc’ll bring you round. I look to be bored by
many more sermons ’fore you slip – don’t move –</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Can’t… order me around, boy. I’m not one of
your crew.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Yes you are. Book coughs up blood, grabbing
Mal. Urgent, almost angry.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You… it’s on you now… all this death, this
shit… you have to find a course. This can’t mean nothing. River… you
have to…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Come on, keep it up – Book grabs Mal’s face,
talks as though replying to something:</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I don’t care what you believe! Just… believe
it. Whatever you have to… His breathing becomes laboured. Hitched.
Stopped. His hand slips away, his blood leaving a distinct print on
Mal’s face. Jayne and Simon run up,Simon slowing down – going to the e
he’s-dead.—-Zne -„a r.7-1, ;,,,r them as Jayne looks around him, Mal
still fixed on Book.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: How come they ain’t waiting? They know’d we
was coming, how come they only sent one?</p>
<p><strong>mo</strong>: Zoe realizes the answer, turns to Wash.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Get on the Cortex. Wave the Sanchez brothers,
Li Shen – anyone whose ever sheltered us after a heist. Tell them to get
out. Get out now.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: V0 I’m sorry. But I cannot let you
hide and I cannot let you run. Things become… extreme. And we wish for
another way.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Don’t talk at me like a righteous man. You are
a killer of children.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: When God wanted Pharaoh to release
His people from bondage – you know the story? He didn’t ask. He sent his
plagues down upon Egypt. That’s me, Captain. The path to peace is paved
with corpses. It’s always been so.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: So me and mine got to lie down and</p>
<p><strong>r–better-</strong>: world?</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I’m not going to live there. How
could you think – there’s no place for me there, any more than 40 there
is for you. Malcolm, I’m a monster. What I do is evil, I’ve no illusions
about it. But it must be done.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Why? Do you know why?</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: It’s not my place to ask.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You will never see River Tam. I’m telling you
this.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Maybe not. But you’ll keep her close
now, and when I blow Serenity out of the air, this will be ended. You’re
so terribly out of your depth, Captain. Your old boat can’t take the
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: She ain’t buckled yet. And the 40 only reason
you’re talking such a lot is you can’t get a fix on us.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Yes, your scrambler’s code is too old
for our seekers. You love that, yes? The small triumph over modernity.
You really are the noble savage.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Nobody – ever – calls me noble.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: But that’s what’s going to kill you,
Malcolm. Nobility. It confuses your text, which is self-interest. And
sin.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Only- many-I-know-who still –bel i-eved- in sin
just died by your hand.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: What do you believe in?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Not a solitary thing.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: If that were true, you’d be nothing
more than a Reaver. Something changes in Mal’s expression.</p>
<p>****: But then, maybe you’re not that far from – Mal flicks a switch
and every screen goes dark.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Get these bodies together.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We got time for gravedigging?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope V0 ’em
together. Five or six of ’em. I want them laid out on the nose of our
ship.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Are you insane?</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: What do you mean, the bodies…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Kaylee, I need you to muck the reactor core,
just enough to leave a trail and make it read like we’re flying without
containment, not enough to fry us.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: These people are our friends –</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Kaylee, you got a day’s work to do and two
hours to do it.</p>
<p><strong>moo</strong>: Piece or two of the other ship, stick it on.
Any place you can tear hull without inner breach, do that too. And we’re
gonna need paint. We’re gonna need red paint.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Sir. Do you really mean to turn our home into
an abomination so we can make a suicidal attempt at passing through
Reaver space?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I mean to live. I mean for us to live. The
Alliance won’t have that, so we go where they won’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: V0 God’s balls, there’s no way we’re going
out there! And everybody is talking at once:</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’s the point of living if you sink to the
level of a savage –</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Please, we should talk this over –</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: I ain’t takin’ orders from a man has lost his
brainstem – , -Mal pule-s-his- in his face, steps back, hand on his.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: This is how it works. Anybody doesn’t wanna fly
with me anymore, this is your port of harbour. There’s a lot of fine
ways to die. I’m not waiting for the Alliance to choose mine. He walks
through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the Alliance fighter.
Struggling to get out is the badly wounded pilot. He sees Mal coming and
raises his hands in surrender. Mal shoots him in the head, turns
back.</p>
<p>****: I mean to confound those killers, and take my shot at getting
to Miranda, maybe finding out what all I’m dying for. That’s my theme
now. So I hear a word out of any of you that ain’t helping me out or
taking your leave I will fucking shoot you. He grabs a body – drops it
at Zoe’s feet as he heads toward the ship.</p>
<p>****: Get to work.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Mal. He looks up: she’s in the corner looking
through that trunk of hers, hands on a long oilcloth wrapped around
something.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Didn’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>i nara</strong>: I figured that.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Anything of use in there?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Maybe. She puts it down and crosses to the
bed. He sits by her.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You don’t have to stay in the shuttle, you
know. There’s empty rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: You think anyone’s set to sleep? Simon’s
portioning out overdoses of morphine, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Cheerful fellow. Did you really miss this
place?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Sometimes… Not so much right now. A beat. He
doesn’t look at her when he asks:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Why did you leave? Site does lo9}E-at– t
-m-</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Why didn’t you ask me not to?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I, uh, I’d better go check on the VW crew. See
how the inevitable mutiny is coming along. They both want to say more.
They don’t. He goes.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Define “disappeared”. The Ensign just
looks uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Every reading I’m getting says normal. Oceans,
land masses… no tectonic instability or radiation.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Yeah, but no power, either.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Nothing at all?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Wait. Something. Might be a beacon, but it’s
awful weak.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Find it.</p>
<p><strong>v0 mal</strong>: Gravity’s Earthnorm.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: 02 levels check, pressure… if there’s anything
wrong the scanner isn’t reading it. Mal pulls off his helmet. Breathes,
looking around him.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Well something sure as hell ain’t right…</p>
<p><strong>wider angle</strong>: They’re in a CITY. Gleaming metal,
spread out for miles in every direction. Portions decimated by fires
long since cold, others overgrown with weeds, but mostly intact. But
silent, as if trapped in amber.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: –ai-n-lt the settlement-</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We flew over at least a dozen cities just as
big. Why didn’t we hear about this?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Beacon’s up ahead.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Ho. She moves rapidly, gun out, to:</p>
<p><strong>angle: a skeleton</strong>: Face-down on the ground, clothes
tattered. She examines it as Mal approaches, waving the others back.</p>
<p>****: No entry wound, fractures…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Poison?</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Got another one!</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: JAYNE is by a downed hovercraft. Inside are
three skeletons: two grown-ups and a small child. Clothes in better
condition, and again no sign of violence.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: They’s all just sittin’. Didn’t crash…</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: RIVER is quietly becoming more and more
upset.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: KAYLEE walks in front of an office
building, staying away from the cars as she hears:</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Couple more here… 0 0 orpse _of_aman is
pressed up against the glass wall right behind her. Mouth open, skin
dead blue, terribly skinny… a thing to haunt.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Kaylee… Come this way. Come here. Don’t – But
she looks –</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: GAAAAaaoh God – – and steps back, horrified,
as the others approach. It’s an office. About half the employees are
there, in chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first
fellow. We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates…</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: How come they’re preserved?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Place must’ve gone hermetic when the power
blew. Sealed ’em.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: What’re they doing? What’s everybody
doing?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: There’s no discoloration, nobody’s doubled
over or showing signs of pain…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: There’s gasses that kill painless, right?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: But they didn’t fall down. None of them. They
just lay down.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: More than anything, it looks like
starvation.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Anybody want to bet there’s plenty of food
around?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: They just lay down… They notice River now, in
the middle of the street, keening. She drops to her knees, clutching her
head.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: , make them stop, they’re everywhere, every
city every house every room, they’re all inside me, I can hear them all
and they’re saying nothing! GET UP! PLEASE, GET THEM UP! , please God
make me a stone…</p>
<p>****: She’s starting to damage my calm.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Jayne –</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: She’s right! Everybody’s dead! This whole
world is dead for no reason!</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Let’s get to the beacon.</p>
<p><strong>caron</strong>: – just a few of the images we’ve recorded,
and you can see it isn’t.. it isn’t what we thought. There’s been no war
here, and no terraforming event. The environment is stable. It’s the
Pax, the G-32 Paxilon Hydroclorate that we added to the air processors.
It’s… .well it works… it was supposed to calm the population, weed out
aggression. Make a peaceful… it worked. The people here stopped
fighting. And then they stopped everything else. They stopped going to
work, stopped breeding… talking… eating… There’s thirty million people
here and they all just let themselves die. They didn’t even kill
themselves. They just… most starved. When they stopped working the power
grids, there were overloads, fires – people burned to death sitting in
their V0 chairs. Just sitting. There is a loud bang somewhere behind her
– she starts, gathers herself.</p>
<p>****: I have to be quick. There was no one working the receptors when
we landed, so we hit pretty hard. We can’t leave. We can’t take any of
the local transports because… The bang again.</p>
<p>****: There are people… they’re not people… about a tenth of a
percent of the population had the opposite reaction to the Pax. Their
aggressor response increased… beyond madness. They’ve become…</p>
<p>****: Reavers… they made them…</p>
<p><strong>caron</strong>: I won’t live to report this, and we haven’t
got power to… people have to know… We meant it for the best… to make
people safer… to… God! She whirls, grabs a gun and fires – then aims the
gun at her own head - but a Reaver is on her, knocks the gun away and
bites her face – She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting
at her and tearing at her clothes, at her skin.</p>
<p>****: Turn it off. Wash does, nobody saying anything.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I seen so much death… I been on fields carpeted
with bodies, friends and enemies – I seen men and women blown to messes
no further from me than you.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Mal…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: But every single one of those people died on
their feet. Fighting.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Mal, I need your help with this. I need you
to help me, because I can’t – He looks at her, folds her into his arms.
Brings her face to his, not kissing but touching, pressing into each
other with the urgency of pulsing, necessary life.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: River…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I’m all right. She looks at him, wet eyes
full of clarity.</p>
<p>****: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>v0</strong>: Wash pulls the recording cylinder out of the
console.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: This report is maybe twelve years old.
Parliament buried it, and it stayed buried til River dug it up. This is
what they feared she knew. And they were right to fear, ’cause there’s a
universe of folk that are gonna know it too. They’re gonna see it.
Somebody has to speak for these people. He pauses. Everyone waits.</p>
<p>****: You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all V0
come to the same place. So now I’m asking more of you than I have
before. Maybe all. ’Cause as sure as I know anything I know this: They
will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground, swept
clean. A year from now, ten, they’ll swing back to the belief that they
can make people… better. And I do not hold to that. So no more running.
I aim to misbehave. There is a beat as he eyes them all.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: My grandma always told me: if you can’t do
something smart, do something right. By way of emphasis he loudly cocks
his big-ass rifle. Mal takes in the fact that Jayne has spoken for them
all.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: That the same grandma told you 4 there was an
evil dwarf spirit living in your well?</p>
<p>****: She was a fun grandma.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Do we have a plan?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Mr Universe. We haven’t the equipment to
broadwave this code, but he can put it on every screen for thirty
worlds. He’s pretty damn close, too.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Based on our orbital trajectories, he reached
optimum proximity just before our sunset. If we make a direct run within
the hour we’re only 67,332 miles out. At full burn we’d reach him inside
of three- hours .</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: Still got the Reavers, and probably the
Alliance between us and him.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: It’s a fair bet the Alliance knows about Mr
Universe. They’re gonna see this coming.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: No. He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening
imperceptibly.</p>
<p>****: They’re not gonna see this coming.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: One of Serenity’s jet engines, as it FIRES
up.</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: It’s no problem! Bring it on bring it
on bring it on! From here to the eyes and ears of the ’verse, that’s my
motto, or it might be if I start having a motto.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: We won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: You’re gonna get caught in the ion
cloud, it’ll play merry hob with your radar, but pretty pretty lights
and a few miles after you’ll be right in my orbit.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You’ll let us know if anyone else comes at
you?</p>
<p><strong>mr universe</strong>: You’ll be the first.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: the Operative’s sword, as he unsheathes
it.</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: I’m reading activity in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Lock and fire on my command. You
should have let me see her. We should have done this as men. Not with
fire…</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Sir! ,Wd</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Vessel in range, lock on…</p>
<p>****: Bastard’s not even changing course…</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: That’s not good…</p>
<p>****: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Target the Reavers! Target the
Reavers! Target everyone! Somebody FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: We’re too close for them to arm –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: This is gonna be very tight –</p>
<p>****: Hey look, we’re upside down. V0 Zoe and Mal shoot a look at
Jayne.</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar.</p>
<p><strong>angle: serenity</strong>: She nearly makes it all the way
through the alliance fleet before a barrelling chunk of debris – which
is twice their size – forces them to come hard about and remain in the
fray.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Chickens come home to roost… They are suddenly
JOLTED by a glancing blow from another ship – Wash struggles to control
her –</p>
<p>****: The hell –</p>
<p>****: It’s okay! I am a leaf on the wind!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>4 wash</strong>: We’re fried! I got no control!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Where’s the back up? Where’s the back up? He
and Wash are frantically flipping buttons – the ship whirs to a
semblance of life - -</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Back up reads at 20%.. - Can you get us
down?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I’m gonna have to glide her in!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Will that work?</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: 140 Long as that landing strip is made of
fluffy pillows…</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Everybody to the upper decks! Strap yourselves
to something!</p>
<p><strong>wash</strong>: I am a leaf on the wind. Watch – A massive
harpoon CRASHES through the windshield and impales him to his chair.
It’s as thick around as a telephone pole. Wash has time to open his
mouth in surprise before he is dead.</p>
<p><strong>wash!</strong>: She moves to him –</p>
<p>****: Wash baby baby no, come on, you gotta move you gotta move baby
VW please – Mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile
slams through the window into the wall above them.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Go! The entire crew piles out, all heavily
bedecked with weapons.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Head inside!</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Come on. Jayne, rearguard. Zoe slows, looking
around her.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Sir. This is a good hold point_</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: We all stay together –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No. They have to come through here; they’ll
bottleneck and we can thin ’em out. We get pushed ,oO back there’s the
blast doors.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: I can rig ’em so they won’t re- open once
they close.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Then shut ’em and hide til –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: We need to draw them til it’s done. This is the
place. We’ll buy you the time.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Move those crates back there for cover – and
make sure they ain’t filled with anything goes boom.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Wait, Wash – where’s Wash? Nobody realized
he wasn’t there. Zoe is dead calm. ,No ZOE He ain’t comin’. Everybody
takes that in, Kaylee’s eyes welling up.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Move the gorram crates! Come on! We hear
savage SCREAMS from the hanger – they’re approaching. Mal moves to the
door, Jayne beside him.</p>
<p><strong>angle: his pov</strong>: Reavers rush toward them. He turns
to Jayne.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Tell me you brought ’em this time… Jayne smiles
grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the
Reavers.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Zoe… are you here? She looks up at him.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Do the job, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You hold. Hold till I’m back. He takes off –
passes Inara, the two of them holding a look for as long as they can.
Then he’s in the elevator and gone. Jayne moves over to Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Captain’s right. Can’t be thinking on revenge
if we’re gonna get through this.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You really think any of us are gonna get
through this? He looks back at their army: A companion, a doctor, a
mechanic and a more-than-usually out of it River. A beat, and he looks
back at Zoe with forlorn hope:</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: I might…</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: MR UNIVERSE is lying dead, eyes open, half
draped on his equally still lovebot. A trail of blood shows he crawled
from his chair.</p>
<p><strong>v0</strong>: Mal comes close. Nothing. He starts to move away
again and the lovebot turns her head, her eyes focusing with an audible
whir. She speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness, and a
warped, computery version of Mr Universe’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>lovebot</strong>: Mal. Mal stops.</p>
<p>****: Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me with a sword. How weird is
that? I got… a short span here… they destroyed my equipment but I have a
back-up unit… bottom of the complex, right over the generator. Hard to
get to. I know they missed it. They can’t stop the signal, Mal. They can
never stop the signal.</p>
<p>****: Okay this is painful. On many levels. I’m not –</p>
<p><strong>a0</strong>: She turns back, powering down. Recording over. A
beat, and Mal takes off.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I can’t shut them up…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s okay… -</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: They’re all made up of rage. I can’t… A BANG
as a body slams against the door.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Just stay low. I’m right here.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: She picked a sweet bung of a time to go
helpless on us.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Jayne and I take the first wave. Nobody shoots
less they get past our fire. Simon moves to Kaylee, who is shaky as
hell. The bangs on the door continue.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Oh, I didn’t plan on going out like this. I
think we did right, but…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I never planned… anything. I just wanted to
keep River safe. Spent so much time on Serenity trying to find us a home
I never realized I already had. She looks at him with soft surprise.</p>
<p>****: My one true regret in all this is never being with you.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: With me? You mean to say, as, sex?</p>
<p>****: I mean to say. Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more
precision than we might expect from her, takes steady aim at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Hell with this. I’m gonna live. Simon looks
at her a moment, then turns his attention to the door. Inara come up
into frame with the contents of the oilcloth: a bow and arrow, which she
pulls back with focused grace.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: THE DOOR starts to come off its hinges.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Guy killed me, Mal.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Hard to get to. That’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Zoe… Gorramnit… But she is in a trance, and
we see beneath the calm, to the bubbling magma of rage that keeps her
firing, single shots, each one a kill, till five men down and she’s out
of ammo. The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
precision of military training still in her as she flips him, wresting
the blade free and swinging it down out of frame, bringing it up bloody,
swinging again as the door bursts open and she’s rushed from behind —
But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot, moving
forward himself –</p>
<p>****: ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line! vo� She looks up, almost
confused – and one of Jayne’s targets comes back off the ground and
slices at her back with a blade, she screams as he cuts deep – and an
arrow lodges in his neck. Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only
slightly.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Shot me in the back. I haven’t… made you angry,
have I? I s</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: There’s a lot of innocent people in
the air being killed right now.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You have no idea how true that is. There’s no
wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing off at ten paces.</p>
<p>****: I know the secret now. The truth that burned up River Tam’s
brain and set you after her. And the rest of the ’verse is gonna know it
too. ’Cause they need to.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: You really believe that?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: You willing to die for that
belief?</p>
<p><strong>v0</strong>: I am. The Operative raises his gun – but Mal is
the quickdraw master, shoots the gun out of the Operative’s hand and
gets two hits to the chest before he makes it to cover.</p>
<p>****: Of course, that ain’t exactly plan</p>
<p><strong>a..</strong>: He drops out his cartridge and slams another
in. The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out at Mal
– and more shots send him scrambling back to cover. Mal holsters his gun
and jumps for the rung above him, starts going hand over hand to the
island, moving as fast as he can. The Operative sees his moment, dives
for his gun – but it’s been ruined by Mal’s shot. He looks over at Mal
with death in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and grabs
a chain – it snaps and he swings, grabbing another. He reaches Mal and
double kicks him from behind – Mal flies 4 off the rung but grabs a
chain – he tries to kick at the Operative, but the guy is frikkin’
Tarzan, he climbs up and pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal’s chain
– Mal goes swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward the platform
from above.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Spine’s intact –</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Just gimme a bandage. Simon pulls a spraycan
from his bag, sprays the wound with a foam that hardens instantly into
an elastic covering.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Oh, now you’re likin’ guns, huh? Cheaters! He
takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing. River watches,
the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and starts another round – but
she’s peppered with dart-like projectiles. She screams and drops the
weapon, pulling the projectiles from her – Inara helps her up, pulls her
back as Zoe shouts:</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Everybody fall back! Fall back! Everyone
stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor. Inara hits the controls
and the doors start to close, from each side and above and below. Then,
when the hole is maybe four by four, they stop.</p>
<p>****: Jayne! Grenade!</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: Very last one… He tosses it through the hole.
Zoe doesn’t even flinch from the blast as she thinks.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: They’re gonna get in –</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: Can close it… from outside…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No one’s coming back from that… She tries to
stand, fails.</p>
<p>****: How much ammo do we have?</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: We got three full cartridges and my swingin’
cod. That’s all. Inara is by the elevator, pounding for it to come.—</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Lift isn’t moving…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: When they come, try to plug the hole with ’em…
Kaylee cries out and Simon moves to her.</p>
<p><strong>kaylee</strong>: I’m starting to lose some feeling here… I
think there’s something in them darts they throwed at me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Lie still. I’m gonna give you something to
counteract the – He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by
Zoe.</p>
<p>****: My bag. and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly –
everything suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
lifted, a confused expression on his face – then speeding right back up
as he slams down on his back, gasping for air. River’s mouth opens in a
scream she doesn’t make. Blood spreads from Simon’s belly. Inara rushes
to him, grabs cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon’s hand on
it.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Keep pressure here…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: My bag. Need… adrenaline… and a shot of
calaphar for Kaylee… I can’t… River…? She is by his side, takes his
hand. She has a kind of serenity to her, like she understands something
now.</p>
<p>****: River… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: No. No. The lights go out. Everyone looks
about them. Jayne fires again, but all the sound has bled out save these
two.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I hate to… leave…</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: You won’t. You take care of me, Simon. You’ve
always taken care of me. She stands as the emergency lights come on,
giving her face an unearthly glow as she looks down at him.</p>
<p>****: My turn. She’s running so fast, nobody has time to react til
she DIVES through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
the scream following us back into the Black Room where River lands in a
perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers. Without a moment’s
hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets the doors closing. She dodges
a blade, but a blow to,the back of the head shakes her. She weaves
around a couple of Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last
second her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her. The last
thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm over her.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a
shuddering RLUNG.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: You know what your sin is,
Malcolm?</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Aw hell, I’m a fan of all seven. He headbutts
the Operative viciously, then punches him so hard he staggers back,
losing his grip on the sword. The Operative responds with a spin kick –
Mal holds up the screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right
into it, gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver – and leg it’s stuck in –
back as he rockets his fist into the Operative’s chin. The Operative
goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword still in his belly.</p>
<p>****: But right now… He pulls the sword out, grimacing. Holds it over
the Operative. The smile gone.</p>
<p>****: vao I’m gonna have to go with Wrath. He stabs down at his foe’s
face – but the Operative rolls out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground
and is up in a second, grabbing Mal’s sword hand – the sword drops – and
punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.</p>
<p><strong>jayne</strong>: You suppose he got through? Think Mal got the
word out?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: He got through. I know he got through.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I’m sorry. The Operative spins him
and DIGS his bunched fingers right into the same nerve cluster that he
paralyzed Doctor Mathias with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of
pain. The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword. Mal
trembles, trying to move – but nothing happens.</p>
<p>****: You should know there’s no shame in this. You’ve done
remarkable things. But you’re fighting a war you’ve already lost. He
lunges – and Mal twists gracefully out of the way, grabbing the
Operative’s swordhand and pulling it forward – while driving his elbow
into the Operative’s neck with staggering force.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Iwo Well, I’m known for that. The Operative
drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back, unable to make a sound. Mal
spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own through them in a
twisted full nelson – then bringing his arms up suddenly, the
Operative’s mouth going wider as we hear his arms crack. Mal drops him
sitting against the railing, picks up his sword, saying:</p>
<p>****: Piece a shrapnel tore up that nerve cluster my first tour. Had
it moved. He squats down, looks the Operative in the face.</p>
<p>****: Sorry ’bout the throat. Expect you’d wanna say your famous last
MW words now. Just one trouble. He reaches over the railing, pulls the
back of the Operative’s jacket through and shoves the sword through the
fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position.</p>
<p>****: I ain’t gonna kill you. He moves to the console, starts
prepping it.</p>
<p>****: Hell, I’m gonna grant your greatest wish. He inserts the
cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life.</p>
<p>****: I’m gonna show you a world without sin. He hits “send all”. The
cylinder lights up and the broadcast V0 begins. Here it is projected as
a two-dimensional image on the clear plastic partition, right in front
of the Operative. There are images first of the city – of bodies, on the
street, in homes and offices… image after image, jus.t as we saw on the
research vessel – and in River’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>caron</strong>: These are some of the first sites we scouted
on Miranda. There is no one living on this planet. There is no one… Mal
hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other side. He begins
to cross. Never even looks back. On the Operative, trapped, watching in
growing horror…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION. Face full
of fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate. And a small hand
smashes that face so hard that teeth fly – the Reaver clearing frame to
reveal:</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>140 mal</strong>: It’s done. Report? Zoe looks at the badly
wounded Simon, is about to give a report – and the doors start to open
behind her. Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising
weapons, as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to reveal
River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver blades, is bloody but
unbowed. And the only one alive. We hold on her a moment, then the wall
behind her is ripped completely away. Behind it, grappling hooks chained
to a huge tractor pull the wall away as through the smoke come some
fifteen Alliance soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang…</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Drop your weapons! Drop ’em now!</p>
<p><strong>another soldier</strong>: Do we engage? Do we engage?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Targets are acquired! Do we have a kill
order? Do we have an order?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks. Widen to
see:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: If you’re here to tell me we ain’t finished…
then we will be real quick. The Operative stands just under the canopy
of the nose of the ship, framed by the rain behind.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: Do you know what an uproar you’ve
caused? Protests, riots – cries for a recall of the entire
Parliament.</p>
<p>****: We’ve seen the broadwaves.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: You must be pleased.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: ’Verse wakes up a spell. Won’t be long ’fore
she rolls right over and falls back asleep. Taint my worry.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I can’t guarantee they won’t come
after you. The Parliament. They have a hundred men like me and they are
not forgiving.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: That don’t bode especially well for you… giving
the order to let us go, patching up our hurt…</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: I told them the Tams were no longer a
threat – damage done.</p>
<p><strong>w mal</strong>: They take you down, I don’t expect to grieve
overmuch. Like to kill you myself, I see you again.</p>
<p><strong>the operative</strong>: You won’t. There is… .nothing left to
see. Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head inside.
The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops to look up at the
nose of the ship.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in
the rain.</p>
<p>****: “Serenity”. You lost everything in that battle. Everything you
had, everything you were… how did you go on? Mal hits the button to
close the inner doors, steps inside as they slide together. Glances at
the Operative, unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You still standing there when the engine
starts, you never will figure it out. The Operative watches the door
shut. A moment, and he goes.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What a whiner…</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Sir, we have a green light. Inspection’s pos
and we’re clear for upthrust.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Think she’ll hold together?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: She’s tore up plenty. But she’ll fly true.</p>
<p><strong>vw</strong>: A beat between them before:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Make sure everything’s secure. Could be
bumpy.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Always is. She takes off and Mal heads up the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: We’re taking her out. Should be about a day’s
ride to get you back to your girls.</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You ready to get off this heap and back to a
civilized life?</p>
<p><strong>inara</strong>: I, uh… I don’t know. He looks at her, a smile
in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Good answer. He turns and heads into the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: You gonna ride shotgun, help me fly? V0 River
is in the copilot’s seat, looking intently at the screens and
buttons.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: That’s the plan.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Think you can work out how to get her in the –
She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship hums to
life.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Okay, clearly some aptitude for the… but it
ain’t all buttons A0 and charts, . You know what the first rule of
flying is? Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I’m about
to say.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: I do. But I like to hear you say it. He looks
out at the rain on his windows, at his screens, taking her up as he
says:</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: Love. You can learn all the math in the ’verse,
but you take a boat in the air you don’t love, she’ll shake you off just
as sure as the turning of worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she
oughta fall down, tells you she’s hurting ’fore she keens. Makes her a
home. River also looks out at the sky.</p>
<p><strong>river</strong>: Storm’s getting worse.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: We’ll pass through it soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>mal</strong>: What was that?</p>
</body>
