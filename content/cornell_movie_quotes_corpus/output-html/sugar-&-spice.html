<h1 id="sugar--spice">sugar-&amp;-spice</h1>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Single file - stay to the right of the
line…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Take your time. Take a good look.</p>
<p><strong>safeway cashier</strong>: Ah, a-are you sure they can’t see
us?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Two-way mirror, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>factory worker</strong>: But they’re trained killers. A guy
at the plant says, “In ’Nam they could smell ya!”</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: This is the United States of America,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Face front.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’m sorry to bother you, ma’am, but is this
going to take long? It’s game night.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Picture in three –</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: – two, one…</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: …a heinous crime has been committed
here…</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: …and testifying in such a case is a
serious matter. Should you decide your testimony would jeopardize your
personal safety.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Look, “Sipowitz”, I said I’d tell you
everything - I was just hoping to finish up before menopause kicks
in.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Let’s start with the one who thinks her shit
don’t stink. Diane Weston.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She’s like a goddamn poster child for high
school.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Morning, sunshine. Remember, these are the
best days of your life.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: – so far!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: If I wasn’t such a lady, I’d tell you what a
bitch she really is.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She’s the A-squad captain - stole the title
from me. You should charge her with that…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hey, Bruce! You look cute…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Tommy Hilfiger. I’m hoping fourth year’s a
charm.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Outta my way, fag. I’m up.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This really should have been my year. I had a
lotta work done - I-I mean, y’know, I’d done a lotta work over the
summer.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Lisa?… Is-is that you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I lost a little weight.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You could tell it made her nervous.</p>
<p><strong>diane/lisa</strong>: Ready? Okay!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But they have to, y’know, spread the talent
around, so I’ve been on the B squad for four years.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Now, the squad as a whole? They’re closer than
Carolina cousins. Some people say they’re, like, lezbos or something.
But that’s mostly just the yag-offs in band…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: …truth is, they’re so close - they all get
their monthly visit from “Aunt Rose” at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: First, there’s Hannah Wold…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She’s their base. Strong as an ox. She’s like
this Uber-Christian - doesn’t say much. I mean, if she wasn’t kinda
pretty, you’d go, “Hey, who’s the tard?”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Then, there’s Cleo Miller…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Number one - not a natural blonde.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I know. I’ve been in the locker room and seen
south of the border. Number two – She has to see the school shrink.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Dreams? You mean, like, where I’m in Conan’s
all leather apartment - I don’t know if he has one, that’s why it’s a
dream - and suddenly we’re buck-naked and all oiled up. I don’t know
where the oil comes from - again, that’s why it’s a dream.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Cleo’s weird, but Kansas Hill - that girl’s
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Son-of-a-blue-balled-bitch! I always get
this one.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Mouth on her that could stop a bull in heat.
Gets her nut-brain from her mom. See, Mrs. Hill’s been in prison since
the day Kansas was born…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She was lying there, in labor with Kansas,
when she sees something going on in the next bed.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Turns out it’s Kansas’ dad, uh, taking a
nurse’s temp. Stay with me, I’m trying to be delicate.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: So, Mrs. Hill whips out a shotgun and blows
his ass to kingdom come.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jury said, because the majority of women in
Lincoln County having babies don’t bring a shotgun, it counted as
premeditation.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She got life without parole, so Kansas lives
with her grandparents.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Then there’s Lucy…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Geek extraordinaire - a walking left brain.
She’s supposed to have this genius I.Q.?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Truth is, she’s an obsessive-compulsive little
freak.</p>
<p><strong>diane/lisa</strong>: Hands in, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Today, we’re going to cheer loud, jump high,
and look pretty because –</p>
<p><strong>diane/squad</strong>: CHEER-LEADERS-KICK –</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Now let’s get going - because nobody ever got
ahead by sitting on their behind!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The school year started off like normal.
Principal Smith gave his pep talk –</p>
<p><strong>principal smith</strong>: … and if you are approached to buy
drugs, let someone you trust know. If you are thinking of harming
yourself or others, let someone know. If it burns when you urinate, have
milky seepage or are being touched by an uncle - let someone know…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The A-squad performed…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Now, I know it’s my duty to give you all the
facts, so I have to say that their cheer blew like a bulimic after
Christmas dinner. Their blatant disregard for National High School
Cheerleading Association rules made me sick. “Basket toss flips and wolf
wall pyramids over two people high are strictly prohibited.” I made a
complete report and sent it in.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And finally, the football team was
introduced.</p>
<p><strong>principal smith</strong>: Transferring from Truman High, the
new star quarter back of our mighty Fightin’ Logs!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s when Jack and Diane met. Nobody saw it
coming…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Especially not Jack…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He fell for her hard.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jack was fine - oh man, was he fine. It was
like he was a bar of chocolate and the whole school was on the rag -
everyone wanted a piece of him…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Jack Bartlett… Jack Bart-lett… Jack
Bar-t-lett.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: … Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt… Is Jack Bartlett
interested in me?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I-I’m sorry - can someone else please run
the Ouija board? It’s creepy, it’s wrong and it goes against the
teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Hannah, in order to get real answers from
the netherworld, you’ve gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.
Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won’t dick with you.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Well technically, I don’t think I’m a virgin
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Yeah. This summer at church camp? I’m pretty
sure I had, y’know, an orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Hold up, hold up. Any sentence that starts
with “at church camp” ain’t leading to the big “O.”</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: That’s not true. Those pictures of Christ -
all sweaty and bare-chested on the cross - always kinda made me hot.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Anyway, last time I checked, you still had
to have sex to have an orgasm. And I know she ain’t seen the lord on all
fours - so I’m just saying.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, I want to know what happened –</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Okay, one night, around sunset, I went
horseback riding with the nuns. They went every night. And, well, we’re
trotting pretty hard, y’know? The hard leather saddle, pounding between
my legs…</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: I just got a little squishy…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: All of a sudden, I feel… I feel… I feel just
super alive… “down there.” I swear I thought it was the second
coming.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Nope. Sounds more like the first.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’ll just ask the question myself… “Is Jack
Bartlett interested in me?”</p>
<p><strong>football player #1</strong>: You do the bondo yourself?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>football player #2</strong>: Sure-is-sweet.</p>
<p><strong>football player #1</strong>: What’ll she do?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Never opened her up.</p>
<p><strong>football player #2</strong>: S-weet.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who was the girl who kicked me in the head
yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>football player #1</strong>: Diane Weston.</p>
<p><strong>football player #2</strong>: Now she sure is sweet.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Look, I’ll be honest with you. Most of us
realized we didn’t have a whore’s chance in heaven with Jack the day of
candidate speeches.</p>
<p><strong>geeky guy</strong>: As the A.V. Club candidate, I think, for
the first time in fifty years, we should say – NO to a football player
as king!</p>
<p><strong>geeky guy</strong>: Vote brains over braun!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It was the first time most of us even heard
Jack speak.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whoa…Thanks, uh - WOW. Uh, hey, alright…okay,
uh –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We weren’t disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Guys! Hey, guys! Shut up a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, uh, I think it just really rocks that
the football team picked me as their, y’know, uh, candidate.</p>
<p><strong>female voices</strong>: We love you, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, well, I love you lunch ladies!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I just want to say that there are only three
things I want in life - to someday become a senator of this great
state…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I want to lead the Lincoln High Fightin’ Logs
to victory at the homecoming game –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, okay… Uh, and I… I want to go to the
homecoming dance with Diane Weston.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Ucht! They were like friggin’ Barbie and Ken,
but without the pink, remote control Corvette. Overnight people were
going, like –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “Oh, they’re the perfect couple!”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “They’re so cuuuuuuuuute!”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m sure it gave the internet whacks something
to talk about besides Agent Scully and their most recent wet dream.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Now, I’m not one to gossip, but I think Jack
and Diane got so close so fast because they discovered how much they
both loved…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Now, right about here’s where the real shit
started to hit the fan… Don’t worry - I’ll clean this up a bit if I have
to appear in court – especially if we’re on “Court TV.”</p>
<p><strong>deedee</strong>: Well, there’s a Christmas card.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Come in, come in…</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Say Jack, why don’t you go light a fire
under Diane.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m on it, Mr. Weston.</p>
<p><strong>deedee</strong>: Oh - say, where’re my manners. I’m DeeDee -
you can remember me because of my double “D’s.”</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: And I’m Diane’s Dad, Dennis. Do not try that
after one of my Screwdrivers!</p>
<p><strong>deedee</strong>: Whoooo - now who wants some pigs-in-a
blanket?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hi, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We’re
supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I obviously wasn’t there the night they all
met, but it was probably a super goober fest.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “Your Jack’s one heck of a good football
player.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “I don’t know how he can concentrate with your
lovely Diane cheering on the sidelines?!”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: “Ha, ha, ha, ha…” Ucht!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hold on a minute. Hold on. I have an
announcement.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me and Diane, uh… we decided we’re going to
get married.</p>
<p><strong>deedee</strong>: Oh, oh, mother of the bride - I’m
allowed!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: But not before… I have our baby.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: … so when your dad said, “I never want to see
your”f-‘in’ faces again!” do you think he meant forever or just until
your mom wakes up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know… And what the hell was that sound
she made right before she hit the coffee table.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, if I had to guess… I’d say that was the
sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young
man who’s going to be a daddy of his own… Jack, do you know what I see
here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Spit from your dad?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I see a flower. And y’know, even the most
beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: So, while we’re knee deep in right now - and
things seem pretty “stinky” - in the long run, we’re going to grow
strong from this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Y’think?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I sure do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Diane, I’ve loved you ever since I first saw
you – right before you kicked me in the head.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh, Jack…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Diane must’ve told her squad that night.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No thanks - don’t need one.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m sure they were thrilled. I mean, if Diane
said jump, they’d say “Double Dutch,” “Shoot the Moon,” or “Split
Russian?”</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You just became a statistic!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Oh my G-d! I’m not first!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: But you’re not married.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Wait! Did you say you are pregnant or you were
pregnant… You had it, threw it out and you’re gonna go back and dance
all night!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Shut up, Cleo. Di, how much do you need for
an abortion?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: What?! No! Not an abortion! My church can
arrange for you to go to Oregon and take care of a “sick aunt” for nine
months. Then they put your baby good home and you come back - a little
dazed and puffy - but everything’s fine! Oh please, Di, don’t be a whore
and a murderer!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jack told the team that night, too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, guys? Uh, I got Diane pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>football player #1</strong>: What?! Well - all right!</p>
<p><strong>football player #2</strong>: You nailed Diane Weston? I’d
never wash my Johnson again!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I-I didn’t mean to say “whore,” Diane. I
just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my
head.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I know, Hannah. Look, I’m not going to get an
abortion. I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I’m
just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady
who found herself “with child,” unmarried, on a long road, with no place
to sleep. ’Course, that was a long-long time ago. But no matter what,
she held her head high and said… “Pappa don’t preach, I’m in trouble
deep. Pappa don’t preach, ‘cause I’m keepin’ my baby. Hey. I’m gonna
keep my baby.” The great one…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Madonna.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: We’re here for you, Diane.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I guess their little fairy tale could’ve ended
there, “And they lived happily ever after.” Only problem was… they
didn’t have a place to live!</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What?! But all our paperwork’s there. My
school records, Jack’s football records…</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: Let me explain something…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No. Wait! Did I say Promise! Cross-my heart
and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we’ll never miss a
payment?!</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: Uh, yes. Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Diane. Hold on a minute. I think I know where
this is going. I’m willing to put up the papers for my Mustang - she’s
got a few miles on her, but she looks great.</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: I’m sure, son, but –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay! Stop twisting my arm! I’ll throw in the
speakers.</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: Look, kids, why don’t you just have
your parents come i n and get a loan? Then they could give you the
money.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: With all due respect, Jack and Diane
Bartlett…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: …do not accept charity. We are two young,
able-bodied Americans. We do not want a handout. We want a hand-up. Give
us food and we will be hungry tomorrow. Give us corn - the kind you
plant, not eat - and we’ll grow our own food and… and, uh, then cut it,
and - uh, y’know eat it! Now, if you’re interested in giving us a home
loan, I will sit back down. If not, have a nice day, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: Sorry. My hands are tied.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well… it’s a little more than we wanted to
spend, but we’ll take it!</p>
<p><strong>apartment manager</strong>: Fine. Just remember, I manage the
building. I don’t, like, own it or fix it. So, like, I don’t care if
shit breaks. All I care is that the rent is shoved under my door on the
first. Oh, and if there’s, like, packages outside my door? Leave ’em the
hell alone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Welcome to Burger Bin. Don’t get the
Filet-O-Fish - the fry cook picks his ass.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Two Taco Grannnndes, one burrrrrrito, large
ta-co chips and guacamooooooole…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We don’t really have fried rats in the buckets
- I know, I checked.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’ll be…uh, thirty five cents, please.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Welcome to Dinkie’s Donuts.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dinkie is a bad, bad man…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Y’know what? I’ll save you the time. I’m not
going to lie. I don’t believe in it. If you pick your ass - I’m going to
tell people. I have no idea how to run your registers. And, if any of
you are hard core drinkers and like to throw knives, well, I’m outta
here right now.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, are, uh, you-you’re Jack Bartlett,
right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’d be, like, hangin’ out with us every night
after school, right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah - well, after football practice.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Football practice - fantasmic.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re hired!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m on top of the world!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Di, if we have a girl, we should dress
her like Little Debbie!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Jack, sweetie, I’m only eating for two.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I
want to teach our baby.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like Cocoa Puffs. Good. Captain Crunch. Bad.
Shreds the roof of your mouth. I mean you hear, “Tricks are for kids!”
And you think, “I’m a kid, I guess they’re for me.” But your baby
brain’s got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.
I’m going to save our kid all that pain.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or
Trix the Rabbit, who’d you be?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Trix…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me too! Will it ever end?! I love this
lady!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Jack, I think I should get a job.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But we agreed your job is running the baby
machine…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I know, but that was before.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah! I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.
I’ll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Di!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello, I’m the little professor. Wouldn’t it
be cute if ours looked like this?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I never knew you dreamed of working in a
grocery store bank branch. Baby, we are living the great American
Dream!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Mmm-hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: If you reach for the stars, you’re bound to
get – mm-Jack, pull over.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh? Oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why do they call it morning sickness?</p>
<p><strong>building manager</strong>: I need a place to keep this.
Anyone asks, what d’ya know? You don’t know shit.</p>
<p><strong>heckler</strong>: Hey, Bartlett, pick up your skirt when you
run!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Run, you bastard, run! She’s hormonal!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …she’s in my hands, right? Moist to the touch.
It’s at that moment I think I control her - she’s mine. But it’s a false
illusion, like in “Backdraft.” No man controls fire! She’s ready, I’m
ready, she’s ready, I yell, “One-fifty four, forty eight.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hike!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: I can’t believe they have the “Top Ten
Alternatives to Sex for You and Your Boyfriend” and “watching each other
masturbate” isn’t even listed!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Diane, it says here you’re going to have mood
swings, uncontrollable gas.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: More proof God’s a guy…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: …and sex dreams where you actually have an
orgasm!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Jack, c’mon, you promised.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay, one question.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, me-me-me, mine’s great.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Proceed, Dungeon Master Quan.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay. Jack, y’know how you and Diane… slept
together? Well now that you can’t, y’know, “sleep together,” but you
still sleep together, don’t you ever get, like, just, super horny? If
so, how horny? I’ll be quiet now so I can listen to your answer.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Yeah, Jack - I’d love to hear your answer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The answer’s easy… Oh, “Lolita” is due
tomorrow - Same for “9 1/2 Weeks.” Ditto on “Wild Things.” I’m gonna be
a dad! Dads don’t get horny.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Okay, so they won state - b.f.d. The best part
was Diane was really starting to look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Diane? Diane!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Huh-ha-wha? Ahh! I’m under the ice! I’m uh –
oh…man… That was a weird one.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Another sex dream?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Wayne Gretzky.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Hat-trick?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: He is the Great One…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jack? Oh Jack…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Get your loser ass away from me!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh my G-d - are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Diane?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh my G-d, you’ve been robbed!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No…I’ve been pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Di, are you okay? We can skip the girl party
this week.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Everything’s fine. I’m just having a little
trouble keeping my frown upside down.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You want us to help you pick up?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Don’t Martha-fucking-Stewart me! If you don’t
like it - you try being a pregnant teen!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: And we have our first pregnancy mood swing.
All that’s left is –</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Did you guys hear that in China - or one a
those places that makes the really cheap silk shoes and kids are super
smart - that as a reward for good grades, mothers get their kids hookers
to blow ’em?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Huh. Musta been a dream.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’m sorry to keep asking this, but are you
guys sure I’m not fat?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: “No” you’re not sure or “No” I’m not fat?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Uh, “no”… You’re not fat.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: You sure I’m not fat?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Look, you’re fat, Diane. You’re fat, fat, fat!
Because you eat, eat, eat! What?! She keeps asking because she wants
some honesty.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No I don’t… I keep asking because I feel
fat.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh G-d, I’m sorry… You’re not really fat! I
was just saying that because, uh, I thought that’s what you wanted me to
say.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: “Positive” you’re sure I’m not fat or
“positive” I’m…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh my G-d, I read about this! It’s called a
“pregnancy insanity.” Quick, she needs a sitz bath –</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Look, I might be moody. I might be gassy. But
I am perfectly sane. Think about it. In school, they tell us, “Dreams
can come true.” Right?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: But they don’t tell us how! Well, thanks to
Keanu, I figured it out! Money makes your dreams come true.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing
your mom some day…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Stop, you’re gonna make me cry.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it
taught us that in America, you can cut off someone’s head and still be
found innocent if you have enough money. Your mom only shot a guy…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Now Cleo, I know you dream of an all leather
apartment with Conan - I heard the school shrink telling a lunch
lady.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: And Hannah, you could give your share to your
church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers
advertises.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Or, I could get my own horse…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Or that! Look, you guys, I just want to
provide a future for my baby. I know my bank branch like the back of my
puffy little hand. I could open that safe in my sleep!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I mean it. I’m in. This is the closest thing
to a goddamn family that I’ve ever had. If one of us needs something, we
all do.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Stop it! This is crazy!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: I’m in, too.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Cleo!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Kansas is right. We’re like sisters – we’re
closer than sisters. And you don’t turn your back on family.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: C’mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: And they get caught!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: That’s right. So all we have to do is watch a
bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: And you know real cops aren’t half as smart as
Keanu.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Forget it. I’ve got a scholarship to Harvard
hanging over my head. I won’t risk it.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Conan went to Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Lucy, do you know for sure you’re going to
get that scholarship?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: If you don’t - can you still afford to go to
Harvard?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: … I don’t know. Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: So then this isn’t crazy. It’s a sure
bet.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I guess we’re in this together.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But, we have to make a smart plan!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Of course - of course! Hands in…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: We all have to cross-our-hearts-hope-to
die-stick-a-dirty-needle-in-my-eye that we’ll never tell Jack. We all
know he can’t lie - that’s why he’s going to be such a great
senator.</p>
<p><strong>geeky guy</strong>: … I feel utterly abandoned in a place
that values physical prowess over mental acuity. I can’t wait for all
this to change once we get in the real world…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: … I do! I totally marry Prince William even if
he was gay. I mean, in England all guys are kinda gay anyway. Even
cigarettes are fags over there…</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: …He slices off the guy’s ear, and I mean you
see everything - the bloody pink hole where the –</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Cleo, I’ve already thrown up twice today -
could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Well…uh…they, y’know, uh… They had
nicknames.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: …Page one is a plot summary of “Heat.” Two has
my character summaries. Three is my overall critique and on four through
ten, you’ll find my Nexus search of all prior analysis of this film…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Uh, in summation, no part of “Heat” is really
applicable to a grocery store bank branch robbery.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the heck is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Uh, Jack - look, I can explain…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Diane, there’s no excuse for not taking your
pre-natal vitamins. Now, if you guys were really friends, you’d remind
her to take these.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, Cleo…would you just say my name?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: …so, while it’s a laugh riot for the whole
family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially
when he goes…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Wait a minute. You watched the Apple
fucking-Dumpling Gang?!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I’m only allowed “G” movies.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Am I the only one who cares about this? At
least I watched “Dog Day Afternoon!”</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Excuse me, could you please keep your voice
down? We’re not introducing anger into the womb.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Well how’d you like me to introduce my foot
into your ass?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Kansas!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I’m sorry, Diane, but I’m not gonna watch my
dreams fade away ’cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she’s gonna get
ideas from kiddie movies –</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Those of us who have parents, know that they
have rules because they care!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: You sure you wanna go there?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Uh…maybe?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: ’Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than
you can say “Fat-assed lesbian!”</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Diane Weston?</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Di, we’re sorry. We…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: It’s off… I can’t take the fighting, the
back-stabbing, the open hostility. We’re not acting like cheerleaders,
we’re acting like a bunch of sorority girls!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: It’s all my fault. I’m sorry I ever started
this…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Di, it’s not your fault. We all wanted to do
this - for you… for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie… I’ll
just say I’m counting dirty words for Sunday School.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: That’s okay, Hannah. It was silly to think we
could learn to rob a bank from watching movies. Sex - you can learn from
movies. But robberies? There’s no way.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Besides, TV-LAND had a “Little House On The
Prairie” marathon and the Ingalls made baby Carrie’s bed in a dresser
drawer. I guess I can just do that…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh my G-d…</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Ahh! Baby’s got two heads!!!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It’s twins!!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh, thank G-d! I’m not just super fat!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Oh - okay, we ain’t done with this… Those
babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that
costs a shit-load! We’re gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only
people who really know how to do it - criminals! I’m gonna visit my
mom!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: You don’t look nothing like your
pictures. What happened to the curly red hair?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a
neighbor girl. They didn’t want you to break out and come kidnap me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: Thank G-d. I was starting to think I’d
killed the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: You shouldn’t smoke so many of those.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: I know, but it keeps down the size of my
can.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: They could kill you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: So could half the women in here. And I’d
rather go out with a nice can… So watcha here for? To say how much you
hate me or how much your grandparents hate me…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I don’t hate you. I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Your help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: Now how the hell can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Okay, you can’t tell anybody.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: Gee, I’ll sit out this afternoon’s coffee
talk. Whaddya want?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: My best friend got pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: Before you? Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I know - that’s what I said too. Anyway, we
want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that’s the
sweetest goddamn thing ever…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I know, but we can’t quite figure out how
to, y’know, do it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: So you need my help? Oh my G-d, this is
like asking me for help with your homework. Hey, Mink, c’mere!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: Kansas, I want you to meet someone
special.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom! Like my life ain’t a
great big pile-of-shit ’cause you’re in here? Now I have to add, “P.S.
My mom’s a dyke” too?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: What?! Hush up, you mouthy little
shit!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Hey, don’t “mouthy shit” me - I’m outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hill</strong>: Wait, Petunia. Mommy’s a little amped up
- didn’t get her yard time this morning. Mink ain’t my bitch. She’s a
specialist… in banks.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: Thems some sweet skirts y’got there.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, thank you. They’re actually uniforms -
we’re cheerleaders.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: Mmm-hmm… y’sure are.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Same time tomorrow - we have a visit with
our favorite “aunts.”</p>
<p><strong>mink</strong>: Robbin’ a bank is like pullin’ a trick. You
gotta stay in control, know how far you’ll go for the dough and always
put the rubber on yourself… Well, y’know what I mean. And you gotta do
it the day after Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mink</strong>: Banks never have a holiday pick up, so vaults
are full. Besides, everyone’s at home eatin’ left-overs and beatin’
their kids.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: …You’re only seventeen? Shit, I was
havin’ my third by th’time I’s your age.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Really? You were cell mates with her? Oh my
G-d, she was my hero! Did she tell you what Letterman’s house was
like?</p>
<p><strong>inmate #2</strong>: Y’gotta buy gats from “The Terminator.”
And tell him “Itchy” sent’ya.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: And “gats” are…</p>
<p><strong>inmate #2</strong>: Guns, cuties.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: And you’re called “Itchy” because…</p>
<p><strong>inmate #3</strong>: You listen to Carol, pussycat, a foot on
both sides-a-your bathtub nozzle - make your ride with the sisters seem
like nothin’ more-n-a piss shiver.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …so although their dad said, “Don’t get out of
the car until I get back with help,” they knew the sheriff’s voice as he
yelled. “Run to my voice - and don’t look back.” The twins did as he
said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped
mental patient, bouncing their father’s head on the top of the car! Ah!
They jumped, Diane! They jumped!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: That was gas, Sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh… What are you working on?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Jus some girlie things for the squad.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Whoever gets out alive – have the
authorities to check in the crawl space.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Kansas, you should never judge a book by its
cover.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I guess there’s an exception to every
rule.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: You’re the “Terminator?”</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: You come in here to bust my balls? I kill bugs
for a livin’. G-d already beat ya to it.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: NO! Wait…um… We’re the A-squad from Lincoln
High? So, uh…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: We were told you could “fix us up.”</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Really…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yeah. “Itchy” sent us.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: She did, did she? How is the old girl?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Definitely old.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: That’s Itchy, alright. How many y’need?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, we’ll each probably want one - so let’s
make it five. Five should do it.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Okay. How much ammo you reckon you’ll
need?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Ammo?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Bullets.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Bullets? No bullets! Oh my gosh, these are
just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back,
double full. You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad
to know you’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Right. That’ll be fifteen hundred - cash.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: You piece-a-shit bug zapper!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hey, hey, hey. C’mon you guys. Obviously
that’s a little more than our budget will allow. Basically, we’re
looking for something around two-hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Oh, why didn’t you say. For two-hundred I got
a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back… I’ll gift wrap it for
you. The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: What kind of deal would you make if I said
we were going to the police and tell them you’re selling illegal guns…
to minors! To girl minors!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I’d just hafta kiiiiiill you.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, okay then. It was a pleasure meeting
you. Take care, let’s go you guys.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh please, we’ve all got bright futures ahead
of us - we’re not going to tell anyone. Promise!</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Maybe we can make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Look, we’re not gonna trade sex for guns.
Unless Cleo…</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: My daughter’s always dreamed of bein’ a
cheerleader. Put her on your squad and I’ll give you the guns.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Fern! C’mere! She’s siphoning tanks - takes a
sec to cap off the cyanide hose.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: We’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Holy shit! That’s a poster child for
“Planned Parenthood.”</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: The vagina, forming the lower portion of
the birth canal, will normally expand its folded walls to allow for the
birth process…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Sorry, we had our first basketball game -
went into overtime… Excuse us. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: May I continue, ladies?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Sure. Unless it’s hard for you to talk with
that stick up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Is Jack upset that he can’t be here?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out. Heee
hee-haaa….</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hee-hee-heee-haaaaa, hee-hee-hee-haaaa, doin’
good, Sweetie… Hey-hey, let’s remember our focal point!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: AHHHHH!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: C’mon, don’t stop now. We’re gonna make it,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What a sad waste of a man.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Okay, even with all our savings, it’s still
only six hundred fifty-four.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that’s it? Hee-hee
hee…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Don’t make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Hey, I even took my parents’ foster kid
money. Phillipe’s gonna have to gather rice without pants this
month.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Look, you guys, three strikes we’re out. Let’s
face it. It’s time to abort!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Hey. Eyes on your own belly!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hee-hee-h-wait a minute. Hold on, now. What
do we do before a big game?</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties
on the field are gross.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: My fault - What do we do that enables us to
be as great as we are?</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: I personally think of how Conan started as a
writer, then became a…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: – We practice! Sorry, Cleo.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: That’s right. Practice makes perfect. I’m
practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we’ll not
only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’ve got the perfect job - and I’ve gotta pee
- help me up!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What the hell kind of food are they serving us
that they can turn a profit on two hundred bucks!?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Uh, Fern?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No more filling tanks before practice,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: ’Kay.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: So, y’know, what are you, anorexic or
bulimic?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Just skinny.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Don’t make me hate you.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: You guys wanna hurry up? My grandparents get
back from dinner at four-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: I can’t believe your grandparents never come
down here.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: You have three heart attacks and a half
dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.
Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: He Ikea’d us.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Okay. How many signs do we need? We’re not
supposed to do this…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Maybe Lucy’s right. Maybe this is a
sign.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Screw Lucy!</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Kansas?</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Is that you down there?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Are you girls talking about boys?
Practicing kissing your hands?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Oh yeah, you caught us…</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Oh well, then I’ll put some cookies at
the top of the stairs for you gals.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Thanks! That’d be great.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: You got that big retarded girl down
there?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Uh…Yeah, Grandma. She doesn’t mean that.
Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Then I’ll throw a few more treats on
the plate. Where’s my smokes?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I’ll get them before “Touched by an Angel,”
don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: You damn well better…</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: This is great. What do we do? Threaten people
with a trunk full of parts?</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: I’m sorry, you guys. But when you’re dealin’
with South American Rebels, you kinda gotta take what you can get.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Excuse me, but do you guys know what I don’t
see here?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I don’t see a problem. I see a great big
craft project sitting right in front of us. So, Kansas, get me some
glue, tape and a nail file…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh, and some Lysol if you have…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Please join our “A” and “B” squad
cheerleaders in a salute to winter sports!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: “I….see…girls swimming…”</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: “Boys swimming…”</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: “Ooooh, they look chilllyyyyy…”</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: “Volleyball for her…”</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: I just pulled and it - it came off.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: This is great - GREAT! Now we have to enter
the front door!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Look, it’s really not my fault.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Hey! Rule number one - never take off the
mask! Y’hear me! No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Sorry, Kansas…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: NO-GAH-BUH- NO! Rule number two - NO NAMES!
NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Oh for Chrissakes… “White trash Betty.” I
didn’t realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Well, use your head, “Stalker Betty.”</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Bettys, stop it! “The best squad is one that
hopes for the best and prepares for the worst.” National High School
Cheerleading Association letterhead. Now, let’s give a hands in…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: We’re ready. We’re prepared. And this is
going to be the best bank robbery ever, because…</p>
<p><strong>diane &amp; squad</strong>: Cheer-leaders kick…</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: SHH! It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: What the hell do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I want to help. I’m part of this squad…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Oh no! You committed the ultimate sin - you
left our squad to be with a guy. And - and that guy is the Devil himself
- ’cause only the Devil would turn you against your sisters!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hannah, you really have to stop taking that
church stuff so literally.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Okay, down on the ground! Now!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: I said DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>safeway cashier</strong>: Uh, y-y-y-you robbin’ the Safeway,
or the bank?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: BANK!</p>
<p><strong>safeway cashier</strong>: S-s-so y’want everyone down? O-or
just the people at the b-b-bank branch?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: All of you!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Bank branch!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Bank branch!</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: All of you!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Bank branch only! Everyone else - go on
about your business!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Shit - EVERYBODY DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>factory worker</strong>: This here’s bullshit! That’s what
this is!</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’m fine here - go help!</p>
<p><strong>factory worker</strong>: Not gonna let some piece-a-shit
Betty Doll tell me what to do…</p>
<p><strong>factory worker</strong>: No-sireee-bob…</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Freeze or meet Jesus, Ass-hole!</p>
<p><strong>factory worker</strong>: Don’t we never take the Lord’s son’s
name in vain around this part of the U-S A!</p>
<p><strong>factory worker</strong>: Ahhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>fern</strong>: Uh, I forgot to tell you sometimes when the
rebels take the gun off a corpse, some live rounds get left in the
drum.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Good to know, Fern. Good to know.</p>
<p><strong>craving!</strong>: Kansas motions for her to “C’mon, run!”
but Diane can’t. She goes back for a Snickers. She suddenly stops, digs
in her pocket and tosses a bill to the Cashier.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I feel like freakin’ David and Goliath.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: …I’m walking evidence! One of them stopped my
ass! Can you get a shot of it!? Hey, can someone dust my ass for prints
over here?!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I immediately started helping local police
with their investigation.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, wait - I almost forgot! I-I found
this!!!</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Can you guys believe this? We’re like
celebrities!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Better enjoy it now. ’Cause tomorrow some
little kid falls down a well and we’re nothing but a distant memory.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Disguises incinerated!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Bad news, Di, there’s one thing we just
couldn’t fit in the furnace…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh my G-d! A real crib! You guys - thank you!
Can you believe we did it!? I mean, we did it. We REALLY DID IT!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I guess no one could’ve predicted the
shit-storm that was about to hit. The only thing people cared about,
thought about or talked about was the robbery. Everyone had a
theory.</p>
<p><strong>safeway cashier</strong>: …well, judging by the way the
robbers practically flew up to spray paint security cameras, I think it
was an Asian gang. As a people, they tend to be quite tiny and very
acrobatic…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s all it took, then the next thing you
know…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: …Dim-Sum Charlie’s being hauled in for
questioning…</p>
<p><strong>bank branch worker</strong>: I think it was five pregnant
women, mmm hmmm. My wife and I have two babies of our own and there’s no
accounting for the things they’ll do when they’re in that “condition.”
One night my wife came home from work and she just kicked me in the
balls. To this day, I don’t know what came over her - just kicked me in
the balls.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: From there, the town just seemed to go
ape-shit…</p>
<p><strong>doll.</strong>: Her husband tries unsuccessfully to prevent
TWO OFFICERS from taking her away. The squad sits quietly - horrified by
this witch hunt.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: News of this didn’t stop at the border of
Lincoln County. This thing spread faster than a canker sore on the
girls’ swim team. Someone in Lincoln would say something like…</p>
<p><strong>factory worker</strong>: It was a bunch of faggots! Sure-as .
They was dressed like a bunch of freakin’ Wendy Dolls, for chrissakes.
They had faggoty little voices. And only a buncha G-d- queer’d shoot up
a union cap!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: All of a sudden…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s on Jerry-fuckin’-Springer!</p>
<p><strong>jerry springer</strong>: …today, we’ll meet a growing number
of transvestites who don’t just like to dress up as women, they like to
dress as pregnant women. When we return, “Transvestites with a
Twist.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m not talking “Maury” or “Leeza.” This thing
was definitely huge!</p>
<p><strong>robin quivers</strong>: In other news…oh, did you hear about
the six-armed Betty Dolls that robbed a bank the other day?</p>
<p><strong>howard stern</strong>: Oh man, that’s so my fantasy - life
size Bettys tellin’ me what to do. “Get down on the ground, you filthy
man.” Yes, Giant Betty. “Bend over!” Yes, Mistress Betty.</p>
<p><strong>robin quivers</strong>: They were pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>howard stern</strong>: What?! Knocked-up Bettys?! Couldn’t-a
been Ken, his schlong is molded to his body. Hey, at the police line-up,
they should just see whose knees can bend the wrong way…</p>
<p><strong>bob goen</strong>: …when we come back, a behind the scenes
look at Fox’s week long series, “When Bettys Attack.”</p>
<p><strong>dan patrick</strong>: Tonight in St. Louis, bottom of the
ninth…</p>
<p><strong>dan patrick</strong>: Ramirez with the pitch… McGwire
gone…</p>
<p><strong>dan patrick</strong>: McGwire goes yard for the forty-second
time this season…</p>
<p><strong>dan patrick</strong>: …right into a waiting pack of pregnant
Bettys.</p>
<p><strong>dan patrick</strong>: Did I say that right? A “pack” of
Bettys? It might be a “gaggle” of Bettys…</p>
<p><strong>kenny</strong>: What the hell?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What the hell are you s’posed to be?</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: I’m a bank-robbin’ Betty.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You’re not a bank-robbin’ Betty - you’re a fat
fuck in drag…</p>
<p><strong>cartman</strong>: I am not a fat fuck in drag!!!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Then it happened - the moment I’d been waiting
for! Our dip-shits in blue finally followed up on my evidence…</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: …they now believe a group of young women are
responsible for the Betty Bank Robbery. I’ve said for years the Betty
Doll was a bad influence on young girls.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You sure have…can’t shut you up about your
Bettys.</p>
<p><strong>conan</strong>: That’s right. Now, I mean I’m no authority on
young girls. Or am I? That was kinda creepy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you have to notify police if you move?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: It was Lucy! Lucy went to the cops!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Remember, Kansas, every time you point a
finger you’ve got three more pointing back at you.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: She’s been the weak tit on this mama cat
since the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: That you?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Yeah, hold on.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes
for Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Don’t use big bills!</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: For a pack of cigs? I use her food
stamps.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: We’re dead! They showed this prison movie to
my youth group on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hannah, we’ve…</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: It wasn’t like the prison we saw - all these
women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy
lives they’d lived! Oh G-d, I’m gonna be someone’s bald bitch!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Ooops, hold on a sec.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Di, it’s Luce. Kansas just called and said
she’s going to “fuck me up!” Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas
had to go. I think her Grandma had another heart attack. Anyway, why
does she want to “fuck me up?”</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: She thinks you went to the police.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: WHAT?! That’s insane!!! Why would I go to the
police?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’ve got to get that. Relax. I’ll see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: …my Sunday School teacher says that in
prison, women shove broom sticks up your…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hold on…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dim sum charlie</strong>: Oh thank Buddha it’s you, Kim-Lo,
I’m being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and
it took four days to make this one phone call…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dim sum charlie</strong>: Kim-Lo?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No. This is Diane. I think you have the wrong
number.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Ooops, that’s me – gotta run!</p>
<p><strong>dim sum charlie</strong>: Wrong number Nooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Di? I just called to say that Conan talked
about us again last night.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Thanks, Cleo. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>cleo</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: …and a “bitch slap.” I bet that really
hurts!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Morning, sunshine. Remember, except for the
morning sickness, blinding back pain and embarrassingly unpredictable
gas - these are the best days of your life.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hey, hey, hey, not so fast…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Following your dream is not a crime. Nobody
suspects you. Nobody has a clue.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hey guys. Someone not take a shower today?</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Hey Lisa, did you run into Carmen Electra
last summer?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kansas</strong>: Oh. ’Cause is looks like you got some of her
tits in you…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This just came from the National High School
Cheerleading Association. You might want to look it over before you try
any more “cradle dismounts from double base partner stunts that are over
shoulder stand level without using three catchers.” Oh, or before you
think about robbing another bank.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: …and that’s why I came forward. I mean, even
the kids on the short bus can see that all the evidence points to Diane
and the A-squad.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Sure does. Your testimony will prove
invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Unfortunately, it wasn’t them.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: They were all waiting in my Suburban while I
ran into the Safeway that day for cash…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We were on our way to practice. Now, I really
need to get going, ’cause nobody ever got ahead by sitting on their
behind…</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: KANSAS USED HER MONEY TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY WHO
FOUND AN:OLD PIONEER LAW STILL ON THE BOOKS IN LINCOLN COUNTY.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: IF A WOMAN IS IN LABOR FOR LONGER THAN
18-HOURS - SHE:CAN’T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR HER ACTIONS… MRS. HILL WAS
