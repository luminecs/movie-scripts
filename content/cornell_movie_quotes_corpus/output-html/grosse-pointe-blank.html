<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hooked it.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: I’d come to the realization that
everything I’d based my life on was false. And that my life had no
meaning.</p>
<p><strong>club member #2</strong>: He gets this way when he hits over
eighty-five.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: It seemed like my life was slipping
away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was
futile and nothing had value.</p>
<p><strong>club member #3</strong>: That’s the way life is. The only
meaning and value is what we create. Through structure, and discipline.
Though they seem to limit our freedom, they actually give us great
comfort. Your problem is you’re looking for some great answer. Some
ultimate truth. When what you really should do is go to work and go
home.</p>
<p><strong>club member #2</strong>: And take golf lessons.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: That’s a tragedy. Can I finish my
story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew,
Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist,
herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty
much say the same stuff.</p>
<p><strong>club member #2</strong>: A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are
telling you the same thing? You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: Basically the same thing. In a very
evolved, esoteric way.</p>
<p><strong>club member #2</strong>: Insane.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: To make a long story short…</p>
<p><strong>club member #3</strong>: –Thank God–</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: …at last I found the holistic system
of systems that opened up the doors of heaven for me right here on
earth. And everyday I see the world through the eyes of a child. A world
of creation and wonder.</p>
<p><strong>club member #2</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: Overflowing with love.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the
secrets of your universe are divided up into eight easily digestible
slices.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: See, see. It’s in the accessible and
everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each day you have a little slice of
peace…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh I see. You got your individual slices of
hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: You open ’em up and there’s the
sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It’s the P.P.P. Six Day
Week.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So you eat– read it everyday?</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And these pan pizzas have opened up the
doors to heaven?</p>
<p><strong>club member #1</strong>: Correct. That’s for you. Keep
it.</p>
<p><strong>martin at car</strong>: He fishes out the laminated “Personal
Pan Power” card, looks at it, and tosses it onto the ground. Police
cars, now visible in the distance, wind into the long club driveway.
Martin gets into his car and pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: How was your day, today, sir?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Effective. But to tell you the truth, I’ve
lost my passion for work.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Do you like the people you work with?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I work alone.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: That’s it then. That’s it. I’ve always been
alone. That’s why I’m a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think
on my feet. I survive, I’m a thinker. And I can sit there in front of
your house for two hours and it don’t bother me. Some people can’t do
it! Some people are ranting and raving, “Tell them fuckin’ people to get
out here and get in this car, I can’t– I want a go!” Where you gonna go?
You’re gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o’clock at night. You
ain’t going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to
your house in the evening. What’s the big deal, right?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You understand the psychology of the
job.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I do. Some guys can’t adjust to it; they
can’t handle it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You look like you’re far away. Far away and
thinking about other things. I’m right about that, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Well, let’s just say that sometimes I’m
right. Sometimes you are.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It’s only
natural.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: It’s only natural….</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I been looking at you, and I’ve decided that
I want to share something with you.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Because your problem is you’re bored. And
you have a very big mind. I am part of what I call a brain
syndicate.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I am part of a network of minds, a group of
five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of
miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each
other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman– whatever it
is– and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else’s mind,
far away. Running someone else’s brain.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Up on the right.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: And when you think of it, it’s not so
surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: If it’s not there, I can’t proceed. Tell
them.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tom. I’ve been waiting for an answer. I’m
only in town tonight.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What’s different this time than the last
time? I have to be down front…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …I don’t bother to call anyone else because
you always take care of me.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands full
here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Good. Account number 3649367, transfer to
account number 96-546-38739-47825. Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it’s
Mr. Duckman. If there are any problems, access file 673594638-IO- 98,
and look at it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sorry Tom. But look, I know it’s the
playoffs. That’s why I’m offering a thousand dollars for one seat…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …Well let me ask you, Tom. What do I have to
do to get courtside tickets for the Knicks…?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Never mind. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …Tell them that’s not my problem. I was paid
for one job– the cyclist– not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Patch him through….</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: I’m setting up a concern that would enable
those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Like a union?</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Like a club. Work less, make more.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you, no.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: We could be working together, making big
money, killing important people… I’m willing to let you in on the ground
floor.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And you could be… sort of like… a father
figure to me….</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: It’s a free-market evolution. You’ll wake up
to it… c’mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I
don’t want to run against you. This thing’s real. Everybody’s in.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not me. So don’t paw at me with your dirty
little guild.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: I’m gonna get you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: “Dear Alumni: Can you believe it’s been ten
years? Where are you now…?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Are you guiding an Outward Bound canoe trip
like Brook Stinson? Or perhaps in charge of appearances for the NFL like
Leslie Gunther….?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Could it be that you’re like Chip
Longfellow, at the trade-relations tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser
owns a cheese shop…!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Looking at yearbooks and pictures evokes so
many memories…!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Some good. Some bad. But all
interesting…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Freeze! Police!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …As a graduate of the class of 1984, you are
someone special…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Whenever news of you filters back, the
school is excited and proud of your accomplishments…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared you well
to lead the kind of life that makes an impact on the world…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Remember, “there’s no where you can go that
you haven’t learned how to go in time… It’s easy…”</p>
<p><strong>husky man</strong>: Whatever it is that I’m doing that you
don’t like I’ll stop doing it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: …So come on back to the old oak tree,
acorns. Signed, the reunion committee.”</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Throw that away.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t tease me. You know what I do for a
living.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: It’s from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was
the trip?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away
all personal mail.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: All of it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And not show it to me. Ever again.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: That’s going to cost.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll pay.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: They’re not happy, sir.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m not happy.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: They say their friend was suppose to have
a heart attack and die in his sleep.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: They blame you for the compromise.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And they want me to make up for it.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: In Detroit. This weekend.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tell them that’s impossible. I need my
normal lead time.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: They were very upset.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Would you describe their position as
inflexible?</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: And sir, I also get that broken- mirror,
black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one….</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: There’s nothing to be done about it.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: I liquidated the last account in Zurich,
and split it into two new ones in Estonia.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Good. What else? Anything interesting?</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Mmm, not really. But you’re gonna love
this one.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Enough?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Never enough.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: But it’s a Greenpeace boat. It’d be so
easy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I have scruples. Next.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It’s a
full dossier. Very comprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: You should get going….</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Don’t forget your identity.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: See you next week.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tell Dr. Oatman I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Why don’t you want to go to your high
school reunion?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have
in common with those people? Or with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: You went to school with these
people.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: We’ve spent a lot of time discussing
those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt
associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the
thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Shouldn’t you be taking notes?</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Tell me about your vision of the
reunion.</p>
<p><strong>sizes and open fire on martin. the united force
instantly</strong>: DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON
EACH OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD OFF,
ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’ll be depressing.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I just know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Say more.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: They’ll have husbands and wives and children
and houses and dogs…. made themselves a part of something. And they can
talk about what they do. What am I going to say? “I killed the President
of Paraguay with a fork.”</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: You needn’t be so frank with me about
your work.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why not. I trust you. You couldn’t turn me
in because of Doctor-Patient privilege… and I don’t want to be
“withholding”… and I know where you live.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: You know where I live?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We’re both professionals, Oatman.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: I think what you fear Martin is
domesticity. It’s the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western
Culture. It’s centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th
century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at
home with his wife he thought, “Well, wouldn’t it be great if we hit the
road and fought… oh… the Saracens.” So he put the word out and was
amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and
fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay
at home with their families.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So you’re saying that Ulysses– everything he
said to his queen when he came back–everything was a lie? He just wanted
to fuck around?</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: And how have you been feeling about
your… work lately?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It’s just
getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I’m starting to think I’ve
been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than
me.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The church seems to be purging itself of
it’s pedophile.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s a bull market.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Anyway, that never use to happen. I was
always the prodigy. Now I’m just one of the guys.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Maybe some of the discomfort you’re
feeling is… guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you’ve killed.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: If I show up at your door, chances are you
did something to bring me there. I don’t care about that stuff,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: What stuff?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Morality.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Go to your reunion, Martin. See those
people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a
few days, see how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: If I get antsy I’ll kill a few small
animals.</p>
<p><strong>oatman</strong>: Now we’re making progress.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Meow.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Meow!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Food soon…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tuna or liver?</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Meow.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tuna it is.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: You always say that. You always say that.
I’m telling you, you never met the man.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk
in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Lisbon?</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: In Portugal, yes.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Here’s the news: He hasn’t been in Portugal
since ’90. I know that from the file. Why don’t you read the file,
man?</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: In fact, I think I talked with him, in
Bonn.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: You always say that. You always have to
know everybody. Why don’t I just take the weekend off and let you kill
him. Since you two are so close.</p>
<p><strong>broadcast</strong>: …with highs today in the upper seventies.
Related stocks on Wall Street today as scandal continues to rock the
joint U.S.-Japanese Tech Center…</p>
<p><strong>broadcast</strong>: …An unknown “whistle-blower” has leaked a
number of critical flaws in the safety designs of next year’s models to
authorities that could cost millions in recalls….</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mein hero.</p>
<p><strong>female deejay</strong>: –this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the
time. Oldies from the eighties. It’s a cold summer day in Grosse
Pointe–</p>
<p><strong>female deejay</strong>: –and I’m ready for some good tunes
and angry talk. Or angry tunes and good talk–</p>
<p><strong>female deejay</strong>: –Or maybe we’ll just play the Cocteau
Twins and get over the goo-angry- talking music. As you know–</p>
<p><strong>female deejay</strong>: –for some moments in life there are
no words, and a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest
man–</p>
<p><strong>female deejay</strong>: –The Cocteau Twins, though also a
band of the nineties, will be aired due to the fact that they created
their own language to sing by–</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: –Now that’s freedom–</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: –The best I can do is a rhyme: Where are all
the good men dead? In the heart or in the head? Back later….</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A double shift. What’s it look like? Can I
help you with something?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick up if
you’re there… It’s Martin Blank. It’s gone. My house. It’s not here. My
house is gone and now there’s a 7-11 here… And that’s unfortunate… You
can never go home again, Dr. Oatman.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But I guess you can shop there.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mary, your son’s here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I bought a new rug.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That’s wonderful, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’s a revival tent?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s a place where religious people–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Marlin Perkins and Jim!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Jim?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: His assistant. He acted like Marlin’s son,
only he wasn’t. At least they never said he was… I bet they were lovers,
faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s good to see you. I’m sure you’re
curious about what I’ve been doing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I spoke to your father the other day.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I imagine that’d be rather difficult.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nature made him then broke the mold.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: They told me you’re taking lithium, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, they give me headaches. I have a
headache.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You have a headache?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have a headache. You have a headache?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, I don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You don’t have a headache. I have a
headache.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We had a good laugh, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah. I guess we did.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why don’t you return this car and borrow mine?
Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I think I’ll go see Debi today.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course you will.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I can’t think of anything to say to her that
seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Take care of her. She’s a keeper.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And a leader. Didn’t she meet Castro on
foreign exchange?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I have always thought about her and missed
her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Separate the wheat from the chaff and you’ve
got the candle cat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Remember no matter how impossible your
problems feel. I’ve known people without a chance in the world. And all
of a sudden, they have lives. Time allows miracles. Let yourself
breathe, son.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mom…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “What’s up doc/ what’s cookin’?/ What’s up
doc?/ Are ya lookin’?/ Hey! Look out! You’re gonna hurt someone,/ with
that old shotgun,/ Hey… what’s… up… Doooooc…!/ We really mean it!”</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hey, you’re a handsome devil. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hey Pop… You got off easy. The house is a
7-11. Mom’s a psycho- pharmacological punching bag and I murder for
cash. If you were here I think you’d be proud.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: pries out a wall vent, slides in the case
and replaces the vent.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: “…Against the wind… just a young man
running… Against the wind… let the cowboy’s ride!… Blame on it the
thuuunder! Night moves…”</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. Oldies
from the eighties. That was ah… the Specials. Doing… one of their
songs…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: …and here’s another.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: “Oldies from the eighties?”</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I just play my own collection.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s nice to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: How long has it been?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Since you stood me up on prom night and
vanished without saying a word?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ten years, I think. What I miss?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Well, let me see… they tore down the George
Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street’s a
four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And
Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New
Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Here is now there. There is here.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Those are the headlines.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Hold that thought. WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All
vinyl, all the… No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Tell me about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m in California most of the time.
Traveling a lot on business. That’s about it, really.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not much else.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: What’s your business?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m a professional killer.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Professional killer. Do you get dental with
that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, I’m in town for a few days,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, I gotta go. But I’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: A man comes to you. He is from the past
bringing you pain long since put behind you. He says peculiar things and
leaves abruptly. It all comes flooding back…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: It felt like an apparition, or some cheap,
gruesome Rod Serling time warp I’d been thrust back into without
warning. There’s a strangeness in the air and I don’t mind telling you,
I’m a little spooked. He was a man from my past. A man I loved. A man
who disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: A man who’s walking back into the station.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Well, remember when Frysal’s men paid off
the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the –</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: –Nooo–</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: –Yes. And the Munich Olympics in ’72. A
local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two
minutes before it happened.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: That’s strictly B�ader-Meinhof stuff.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: It was the PLO.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: All right mystery man. I want some answers.
Let’s recap. Spring of ’84. Two young lovers with frightening natural
chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her
father’s house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life.
The boy never shows up, until now. So, what’s the question?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Where have I been?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: More like what happened? What happened,
Mr. Blank?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t know exactly. I could venture a
guess but it would sound like a rationalization… I thought you know…
maybe seeing you, some friends, my house… of course now a 7-11–</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: –Torn down in the name of convenience–</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: –and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part
of that whole equation… I suppose the most important thing, really. I
don’t know. Anyway, this whole thing’s my therapist’s idea. It’s my
shrink, really.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Ohhh. You’re in therapy too, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You see someone?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Uh, no. So you’re back now, a decade later,
and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow
you… access… to my being?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: All right then. Would you like to share any
more deeply personal thoughts with our listening audience before we go
to our phone poll and see how the folks in radioland come down on this
one?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Should a broken-hearted girl give a guy a
second chance at love….</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You’re on the air.</p>
<p><strong>old woman’s voice</strong>: I think this young man has
avoided the question completely. Has not discussed “what happened” nor
if he’s sorry for what he has done. Therefore, I don’t see any reason
why you should see him until he fully discloses his intentions and
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Thank you caller.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You’re on the air.</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy voice</strong>: Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy voice</strong>: No, the guy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah….</p>
<p><strong>dumb guy voice</strong>: Uh… when you guys use to go out… Did
you guys ever… heh heh heh heh… ever fuckin’, ever totally fuckin’ heh
heh heh-</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Next caller.</p>
<p><strong>guff man voice</strong>: I don’t know, Debi. Sounds like bad
gas to me. I would not allow him access to your being.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you loud and
clear: “If you love something set it free. If it comes back to you it’s,
well…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: …Broken….”</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Dammit. Never trust my instincts.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hell, I would’ve voted for you, but there’s
all this apple sauce stuck in my phone… I don’t wanna talk about it. How
the hell are you?! Here’s five good ones!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Marty! It’s me. Paul.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re leaving me hanging here…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey. Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This won’t take but a minute. I just gotta
hold their hands for a final walk-through. I’ll take them in, get ’em
out, then you and I can grab a little quality time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Goddamn, It’s good to see you. I was afraid
you joined a cult or something. I half-expected you to come back to town
in a fennel wreath and paper pants.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: There was no money in it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Same thing that happened to you– I stopped
poutin’ there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the
working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don’t you valet park
your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: God it’s great to see you.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>southtec guard</strong>: Well, we do what we have to do if we
find you on the property. But we don’t really enforce the law, we
execute company policy for homeowners.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So when are you authorized to use deadly
force?</p>
<p><strong>southtec guard</strong>: Well, a ’course, taxes provide your
basic service– police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more
than just that, you understand? This badge doesn’t mean that I am a
peace officer.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So it’s not a meaningful symbol, or
anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look
suspicious on your customers’ property– well, under those heightened
circumstances you have the authority to, ah… To shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>southtec guard</strong>: To shoot you. Correct.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: How did you get this job?</p>
<p><strong>southtec guard</strong>: Well, they were hiring, and it was
only a two week course…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …What more can I say.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: We’ll talk soon.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ll be raising your new family in a work of
art. A work of art in a work of art.</p>
<p><strong>southtec guard</strong>: I’m sure you’ll be very happy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: When my time comes, if it ever does, I want
a beautiful, normal place like this… and a wife like you…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …and you’ll be safe here…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now. I don’t make a habit of pimping my
friends, but there is one prime little piece of land that you must
see…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Debi’s house.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kind of crept up on you, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No. You drove us here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, but it’s still kind of eerie, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ten years. What happened!?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for
the government, and went into business for myself… I’m a professional
killer.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Professional killer, huh? Does that come with
a good HMO?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He sells BMW’s?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He sold me this bad boy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: How could you put your hard-earned dollars
into the hands of the class bully?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He gave me a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mein Dealer.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey! Bob! The car’s running great.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Glad to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s me. Martin Blank.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Really…? So what?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
a-man-made-good party.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What’s done is done.</p>
<p><strong>skateboarder</strong>: What the fuck, man?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Are you going to the reunion?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: No. I’m not going. Is that why you’re
here?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That’s part of it.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Well, you’ll have a ball. You seem to have
everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the
watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness,
character, point of view…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s always the little things.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m wondering how you’ve been. How you are.
I’d like to catch up with you. If it’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Okay. Let’s catch up. You go first.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, there’s not much to tell.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I’m sure you’ve done worthwhile things in the
last ten years. You’ve had experiences.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Bad experiences.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You met people.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Bad people.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Watched television?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Bad television.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Jesus. Marty. You’re pathetic. It sounds like
you need a Shockabuku.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: It’s a swift spiritual kick to the head that
alters your reality forever.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That’d be good.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I figured I could pick you up tomorrow
around seven o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Let me get this straight, are you asking me
out?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Seven it is.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>monty</strong>: Baby, it’s eight o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Thanks, Monty.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Hey there, how’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It isn’t done.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: This is not good.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll do it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: What’s it look like?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: You haven’t looked at the dossier.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ve looked at it.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: You have.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes. It’s the same as usual. Nothing
remarkable about it at all.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: I have to call the client and give them a
reason why you’re late.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tell them my house exploded.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: I’ll call them and tell them you’re taking
your time. Being a professional.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay, call them. Fine. Oh– And if you could
find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me,
and call me back– that’s be great.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Pick me up at my father’s house at around
seven. And don’t be late this time.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: This night, this reunion will be an
important step in our relationship.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You’re fucking psycho.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t rush to judgement until all the facts
are in.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: I wish he’d do his job already so we
could do our job.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: We can’t do our job unless he does his
job.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: Why don’t we just do his job then, so we
can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Do his job? I’m not a cold-blooded
killer.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: Wait a minute–</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not
be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you
come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you’re the Good Guy.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: So if we do his job, we’re the bad guys.
If we do our job, we’re the good guys.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: moving into the diner.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Easy, tiger.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty’s. My name
is Melanie and I’ll be your server this morning. Let me tell you about
some of our specials. Today we have the “Alfalfa on My Mind,” our
feature omelette. And there’s our “Gatsby’s West Egg Omelette.” And if
you’re in the mood for something different there’s the “I left my heart
in San Franchezie.”</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: I want two eggs poached, hash brown
well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white
omelette.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What would you like in the omelette?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Come on, live a little. I’m sorry about the
incident yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No harm no foul.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: A little misunderstanding among my
associates.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: I told them to kill you and they didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hard to get good help these days.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: But since we’re both here, I think it’s time
to take a fresh look at our relationship.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I didn’t get into this business to have
“associates.” And I don’t want to join your Goddamned union. “Loner–”
“Loner gunman.” Get it? “On my own.” That’s the whole point. Why don’t
you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning…
with friends!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Look, this is a one-on-one business… Every
time you get to know people, bad things happen. If it’ll make you feel
any better, this is my last job. So what do you say we put our guns away
and forget the whole damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Fuck you! No scabs! From now on,
everything’s regulated!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No deal.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Fine. But we’re not going to let you do your
job. Because we’re gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we’re
gonna do another little job…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Yeah– after I shoot you through the fucking
forehead I’m gonna fuck you in the bullethole.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Nice talk, Sugarmouth.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes, I’m a pet psychiatrist. I sell couch
insurance. I test-market positive thinking. I lead a weekend men’s
group, actually. We specialize in ritual killings. I’m hungry, are you
hungry, I’m hungry, oooh, ooh. Hi, I’m Martin Blank, remember me? I’m
not married, I have no kids and I’d blow your brains out if someone paid
me enough… So how’ve you been? Where do you stand on The Issues? Are you
Left? Right? Up, down, proud, shamed, blahblahblahblah–</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Flowers. That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: As long as I get the laugh.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Here. Let me put these in some rubbing
alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Okay… Hold on…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: …Let me get my coat.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll just help myself to a cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Newberry.</p>
<p><strong>mr. newberry</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Blank.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: How are you? How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>mr. newberry</strong>: Martin, I don’t know where you’ve been
since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don’t care. It was
good that you left, and I’m glad you did. So what do you want to talk
about? You’ve grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. newberry</strong>: I visualized you, in a haze, as one of
the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I’ve been
seeing in Newsweek.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I took the other road. I’m more of a
self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and
goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and
sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. newberry</strong>: Oh, you know me, Martin. I’m the same
old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at
Kent State. But why don’t we have a drink and forget the whole
thing?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mr. newberry</strong>: So what are you doing with your life
now, son?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m a professional killer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. newberry</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Okay</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Do you want to get a drink first?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I think they’ll probably have booze there.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll just be a second.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …Well, I didn’t kill anyone, but someone
tried to kill me and the guy in the middle got killed. So if I see that
guy again I’m definitely going to kill him, but I won’t kill anyone
else. Oh, except for the guy I was sent here to kill. I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: What else? Say more.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Saw my mom… I’m with Debi, and I’m on my way
to the reunion.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Okay. Repeat this after me.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Out Loud?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …I am at home with the me. I am rooted in
me, who is on this adventure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: Take a deep breath and realize, that
this is me breathing.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: This is me breating.</p>
<p><strong>maritn</strong>: Alright, look. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>dr. oatman</strong>: And don’t kill anyone.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Right. Don’t kill anyone…</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: He’s falling for her. Look at him.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: He using her.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: You’re wrong. Look at his face.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: One cannot love and kill.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: I love. I kill.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Shoulda brought my gun.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Welcome back! I’m Arlene Oslott- Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m Martin Blank.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Debi Newberry.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Marty, you haven’t changed a bit!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: We had pictures put on, that way everybody
knows who everybody was!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: So, what are you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Whatever I can get away with.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Isn’t it cute. It’s so everybody knows who
everybody was!</p>
<p><strong>batender</strong>: What can I make you?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hey, Ken. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Hello Martin. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not bad. You?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Hello, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hey, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: I’m an attorney. I’m with Moss, Brice &amp;
Fromeyer.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That sounds pretty interesting…</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Sometimes. I’m in divorce, mainly. Some
property. Some personal injury.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Those all seem kind of related…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tragedy makes you thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well… I have to take this over to Debi.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Here. Take my card. Wait a minute… here’s a
special one. For top-shelf clients.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know, Blank, all these fucking
people, driving me crazy. Look at them over there, memorializing old
times, acting all like it was something “life-changing.” And the people
in the National Honor Society? The name tags?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: They have special blue starts on them like it
fucking matters now that they were in the honor club ten years ago. I’m
getting fucking nauseous from all this sentimental bullshit. It’s making
me sick.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why are you here… Terry?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I wanted to see a couple people. But I don’t
want to talk about the old days… What did we have together, Martin?
Typing?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Drafting.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, I couldn’t stand that fucking class.
But I appreciate you helping me out, man.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, thanks. Well I’m going to try and get
out of here, man. I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Bob. Bob Destephano.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’m Dan. Dan Koretzky.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Computer guy.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah… Hey, I saw you at your dad’s dealership
the other day.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I sell BMW’s. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Not much, actually. My software company just
went public so I’m just… hanging out, really.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Remember high school?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Sure. Listen. Why don’t you join us up in the
grandstands?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: …You gotta hold the fans responsible, though,
Dennis, because they’re the ones putting up with the mediocre
product.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I guess, though, you know, if you look at it
Mike, that park is a beautiful park, I’ve gone to that park many times -
I’ve had the greatest time of my life at that ballpark and let’s face
it, I tell you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, if you’re having the fun
you should be having at Tigers Stadium, you don’t even know what the
hell’s going on anyway…</p>
<p><strong>darius</strong>: Have you two been together since high
school?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: –Yes. Actually we just bought that little
Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue… Debi’s a social worker and I mow down
insurance claims at Aetna–</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: We haven’t seen each other since high
school.</p>
<p><strong>darius</strong>: I figured. You two look too happy together.
I shouldn’t say that though, I’m married… So, Martin– what are you up to
these days? What do you do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m in pro-active international relations.
It’s a very specialized company. We execute economic investment
opportunities. Sort of economic clean-up… with an emphasis on personnel.
It’s boring, you know, it’s boring. I don’t like to talk about it
because I don’t think what a man does necessarily reflects who he
is…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …I’ve always tried to refrain from a
black-and-white moral lexicon–you know, good, bad, right, wrong–I’ve
been more interested in the gray areas.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But that’s no way to live. I guess you’ve
got to just take the leap of faith. Believe in something. Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>darius</strong>: Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you
happy?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I just have to close this one last account.
I’d like to just stop now, today, but I can’t… It’s a step in the right
direction.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I don’t know, Martin. It sounds like you’re
feeling compromised. Live the way you want. The only thing that’s
inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. That’s the biggest cop-out there
is.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But wait. I still don’t understand what you
do.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You do not.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You don’t…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: In the corporate offices.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh… really?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I sell biscuits to the Southland.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You do not.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s what I do.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re so funny…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I sell biscuits and gravy all over the
Southland–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: –Stop it–</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets?
I move all of those–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: –No.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sometimes we sell them to McDonald’s and
just change them to special barbecue sauce.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: What do you think about black coaching in
the NFL, Darius? Because I think it’s great.</p>
<p><strong>darius</strong>: I don’t pay much attention to football.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I have to agree with you Dennis. It’s good to
see that the owners are willing to put the franchise behind a black head
coach or QB when for years in the league they’ve been kept out of the
thinking positions and relegated mainly to the physical game.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: But now, you see, you have Warren Moon at
the helm, Cunningham, Art Shell, and the coach up at Minnesota…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Dennis Green. And if you remember, Doug
Williams was the first black man to prove that on a Superbowl
Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m teaching art at Cedar Junior High
School.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: …Yeah, listen. Where do you stand on this
whole Louis Farrakhan issue…?</p>
<p><strong>darius</strong>: I’m a De Klerk man myself.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I’m going over to play some tunes.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Look at her. There it is. Jenny Slater. The
finest thing that ever walked these halls.</p>
<p><strong>former-square #2</strong>: I believe she married the state of
Maine.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah, he’s around here somewhere. What a shame.
She would have looked great in my fucking Bentley.</p>
<p><strong>former-square #3</strong>: No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not
only was she as fine, if not finer, than Slater, but she had the “bad
girl” thing going for her. And the red hair. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: She’s a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.</p>
<p><strong>former-square #2</strong>: You both are mistaken. Jenny
Maretti was the finest. No question about it.</p>
<p><strong>former-square #3</strong>: The three Jenny’s. Three Jenny’s.
All named Jenny…</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You know what I’m really hoping? That Jenny
Slater gets divorced. And she’s twenty-eight–</p>
<p><strong>former-square #3</strong>: –she’s got half the state of
Maine–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: She’s twenty-eight years old, with two kids,
she’s still really really fine, and I see her at a bookstore or
something, and she sees me for what I was then, and what I am now: the
redemption for all her failure.</p>
<p><strong>former-square #3</strong>: You mean the redemption for all
your failure.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Which would you rather…?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay… Would you rather… commit yourself
sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert
Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a
otter on crank for a week?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Soft. I’ll take the junkie otter, clearly! I’d
let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants… Okay. Would you
rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller–</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: –She’s not dead—</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: It’s just a game…! Alright. Candied Diller,
or… wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab
apple in your mouth?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Wow. I have to give this some thought.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: No time.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Marty! Debi! How are you! So many people
came, but I never expected to see you Marty. Or you Debi… I mean…
because of what your divorce… I didn’t mean to say that. I just meant
you look so good.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Do you think you could play “Too Shy’” by
Kaja Goo Goo?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Stacey, why don’t you come up here and take
over for a little while?</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Everybody thinks they know me now that I’m
divorced.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: It’s time to see you in private.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Even though I left, you never left me. Not
just memory but a substance in my blood.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Like heroin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Like love?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Could be. The physical substance of
love.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I’ll accept that. Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: Looks like someone keeps trying to do our
job for us.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: If he does our job, he’s our job.</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: I get it.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I’ll be right back….</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit
again?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Fine, Bob. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Never better.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ahhh… it’s all fucked up. Nothing adds up to
nothing… you work your whole life, day in and day out– try to make sense
of it all. One day you’re twenty-seven and what do you get to show for
it…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You could’ve been a contender, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Smart boy. Real smart. Let’s see how smart you
are with my foot up your ass! I’m gonna kick your ass!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why would you want to hit me, Bob? Do you
really believe that there’s some stored up conflict that needs
resolution between us? We don’t exist. There’s nothing between us. So
who do you want to hit, Bob? It’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I want to be an actor.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Then express yourself, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Be honest…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Later, Martin.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Have you seen Debi Newberry?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: The more things change, the more they Goddamned
well stay the same.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks for the
pen.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I was catching up with Bob Destephano.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: As long as you had a good time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What now? Chase the girl?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It didn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I have to get my head back into my work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Work’s good for the soul.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: When you see Debi, tell her I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: See you in ten years.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Dumb fucking luck…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: He was trying to kill you, right!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Not the other way around…?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Is it something you’ve done?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s something I do…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …Professionally…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …About five years now.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Get the fuck outta here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army
and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain
profile. A certain “Moral flexibility” would be the best way to describe
it… I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It’s called
“mechanical operations.” We sort of found each other…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You’re a government spook?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I was, but no… yes… I was before, but now
I’m not. It’s irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it’s
mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I’ll tell
you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my
work.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Then I started losing my taste for it. Which
usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something
entirely different… I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that
maybe there was… meaning to life.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Okay. Great, Martin, that’s just great.
Meaning to life… Mmm….</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Like, that there’s a point? An organic
connection between all living things.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Let me help you along, Martin. You’re a
sociopath!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for
money.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You never could have kept this from me.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I was leaving.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: That’s probably a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I’m staying here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What if I come back?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I’ll hide.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You don’t get to have me. You are a monster,
I’m a human being. We’re not going to mate.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: That’s because I speak human, and you speak
monster.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: “What’s up Doc? What’s cookin’? What’s up
Doc, are you lookin’…?</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: I’m bringing down the office now.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll put things right. Then I’ll find
you.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: Uh… why?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t worry. I left you a little something
under your desk.</p>
<p><strong>marcella</strong>: All right!!</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: What the fuck is the matter with you?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, I was hired to kill you. It’s what I
do, and come to think of it, I told you that, but… Okay. I’m not going
to do it. Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s either because I’m in love with your
daughter, or because I have a new-found respect for life. Or both. But I
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: That punk is either in love with that guy’s
daughter or he has new found respect for life… Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: Why? I build cars! They’re paying you to
kill me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It was a cost-cutting effort. They can’t
afford a recall.</p>
<p><strong>newberry</strong>: It was a leaky sunroof! A design flaw! I
reported a leaky sunroof! You want to kill me because of that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s not me! Why does everybody think it’s
personal?!</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: We’ll go in through the woods.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I was sitting in my house on prom night
wearing that Goddamned rented tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a bottle of
champagne in the other. So I was just sitting there, and then the whole
night flashed before my eyes, and it struck me like a bullet in the
head– I realized, finally, and for the first time, that… I wanted to
kill somebody. So I figured because I loved you so much, that’d it’d be
a good idea if I didn’t see you anymore. But now I’m different.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m in love with you. I know we can make
this work!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I was afraid to commit to a relationship,
but now I know I’m ready to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I just need time to change.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s not easy for me. I was raised to close
off, to control my feelings…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I wasn’t raised in a loving environment. But
that’s not an excuse. It’s a reason.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: My soul was empty–</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: –and it’s up to me to fill it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s okay. It’s Martin The door begins to
open revealing Debi and Newberry.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I know what I do isn’t moral, per se, but if
you could just look past that, you’d see a man worth loving.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Don’t listen to him, he’s a
professional.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: You’re breaking my heart down here, Blank. I
can’t shoot through the tears.</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Did you see Blank in there?</p>
<p><strong>mccullers</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>lardner</strong>: Good. For a second there I thought we were
in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: …How about I sell you two rounds for a
hundred grand a piece?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: There you go. I left it blank.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Excellent. Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Debi… will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry cause that’s
what it does. Bringing you New Ones for the Nineties, a fresh new format
designed to pull you out of what’s come before, and reel you into what’s
coming soon–</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: I tell you what’s coming soon for me, or at
least what I dreamed this morning in that weird time just before you
actually wake up. But first this commercial. Back after this…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Don’t miss the show of the season at
Bilkin Community Center! “Brigadoon!” A musical for all ages!
“Brigadoon,” starring Carol Plummer, Thomas Canchola, Bob Destephano,
and Lee Ordman!…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: RFN…</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Hey out there… Okay… I’m going to finish up
that fantasy later. First I’ll give you an hour of nonstop music… If I
don’t come back on after that– well, nevermind.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: This will never work out.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: You kill people.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I have no illusions about the future. What
is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I
can live with that.</p>
<p><strong>debi</strong>: Other people can’t.</p>
