<p><strong>approaches</strong>: it resembles, vaguely at this distance,
an Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes, beautiful yet
ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it can envelope an entire solar
system. CAMERA CONTINUES APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly,
crossing our POV, a:</p>
<p><strong>out</strong>: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification
emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon language .</p>
<p><strong>klingon captain</strong>: Visual.</p>
<p><strong>klingon captain</strong>: Tactical again. Stand by on
torpedoes.</p>
<p><strong>klingon captain</strong>: Full force fields; evasive
maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>klingon captain</strong>: … severely damaged. Returning
fire…</p>
<p><strong>klingon captain</strong>: Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar…
severely damaged by unfamiliar weaponry… intruder unidentified..</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Our sensor drone is intercepting this on
Quad L-14.</p>
<p><strong>klingon captain</strong>: … believe luminescent cloud to be
enormous power field surrounding alien vessel… size and description
unknown.. our sensor scans unable to penetrate. Imperial Klingon Cruiser
Amar… continuing to attack.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: That’s within Klingon boundaries. Who are
they fighting?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Unknown, sir.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I have an exterior visual!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: We’ve plotted a course on that cloud,
Commander: it will pass into Federation Space fairly close to us.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Heading?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant’s voice</strong>: Sir, it’s on a precise heading
for Earth.</p>
<p><strong>female master’s voice</strong>: Spock, son of Sarek of
Vulcan… and of Amanda of Earth… diligently you have labored for
purification of mind…</p>
<p><strong>male master</strong>: Spock . . . !</p>
<p><strong>female master</strong>: Here are these sands, our fore-
bearers cast out their animal passions. Here our race was saved by the
first attainment of Kolinahr.</p>
<p><strong>male master</strong>: Kolinahr: the final shedding of all
emotion.</p>
<p><strong>female master</strong>: You have labored long, Spock. Now
receive from us this symbol of total logic.</p>
<p><strong>female master</strong>: Come, give me your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>female master</strong>: Our minds, Spock… One and
together….</p>
<p><strong>female master</strong>: This consciousness which calls – it
stirs your human half, Spock? You have not achieved Kolinahr – Your
human emotions are not fully extinguished. He will not achieve his goal
with us. His answer lies elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Commander Sonak… !</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’ve received your appointment as Enterprise
Science Officer?</p>
<p><strong>sonak</strong>: Based, I am told, on your recommendation,
Admiral. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why aren’t you on board?</p>
<p><strong>sonak</strong>: Captain Decker requested I complete final
Science briefing here before…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Here at Starfleet…? The Enterprise is in final
preparation to leave dock…</p>
<p><strong>sonak</strong>: Which will require twenty more hours at
minimum, Admiral…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Twelve! I’m on my way to a meeting with
Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me
on the Enterprise in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>sonak</strong>: To you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I intend to be there following that meeting.
Report to me. One hour!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Admiral, I’ve been hoping to see you. Maybe
you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why aren’t the Enterprise transporters in
operation, Mister Scott?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: We’re hoping it’s only a temporary problem,
Admiral…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: See that it is. Take me over, please.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished
eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a
shakedown…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott, there’s an alien object with
unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this
planet…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … the only Starship in interception range is
the Enterprise! Ready, or not, she launches in twelve hours!</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. earth orbit - angles on travel pod 41</strong>: - -
43 43</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: The crew hasn’t had near enough transition
time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they’ve yet
to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet
Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott – but I wouldn’t
exactly consider myself ‘untried.’</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: They gave her back to me, Scotty.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: “Gave’ her back, sir…? I doubt it was that
easy… But any man who could manage such a feat, I wouldna dare
disappoint. She’ll launch on time, sir… And she’ll be ready.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. earth orbit - other angles from the pod 48</strong>:
- -</p>
<p><strong>53 ext. the enterprise - and the pod 53</strong>: - -</p>
<p><strong>kirk and scott</strong>: Permission to come aboard, sir…?</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Granted, sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral…
Commander Scott, you’re needed in Engineering immediately.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Sir, you’ll excuse me…?</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Sir, if you’ll follow me, I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I think I can find my way, Ensign.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bridge!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain… Starfleet just signaled your
transfer-of- command orders!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I appreciate the welcome; I wish the
circumstances were less critical. Epsilon Nine is monitoring the
intruder; keep a channel open to them. Where is Captain Decker?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: He’s in Engineering, sir… indicates Captain’s
He doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on the Rec Deck
at 0400 hours. I want to show them what we’re facing.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I wouldn’t have wanted to have been standing
in his way. He wanted her back; he got her!</p>
<p><strong>alien ensign</strong>: And Captain Decker? He’s been with the
ship every minute of her refitting…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Ensign – our chances of coming back from this
mission in one piece may have just doubled…!</p>
<p><strong>68 omitted 68</strong>: - - 69 69</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I thought so! See… the trans- porter sensor
was not activated…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Aye, you were dead right about that… Clearly,
put a back-up sensor into the unit.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Admiral Kirk… We’re getting a top brass send
off…? She’ll launch on schedule if we have to tow her out with our bare
hands. Right, Scotty?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Aye, sir, that we will…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Will, let’s go over here and talk.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Let me now when the back-up is in place.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: All due respect, sir, I hope this isn’t a
Starfleet pep talk; I’m just too busy.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m taking over the Center seat. I’m sorry,
Will.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You are what…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m replacing you as Captain of the
Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’ll stay aboard as Executive Officer… a
temporary grade reduction to Commander.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: – You, personally, are assuming command?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: May I ask Why?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: My experience – five years out there dealing
with unknowns like this – my familiarity with the Enterprise, this
crew…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Admiral, this is an almost totally new
enterprise. You don’t know her a tenth as well as I do.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s why you’re staying aboard. I’m sorry,
Will.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: No, Admiral. I don’t think you are; not one
damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You
told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a
starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Report to the bridge, Commander.
Immediately.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Transporter room, come in! Urgent!
Redline on the transporters, Mister Scott!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Transporter room, do not engage! Do not….</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Too late; they’re beaming now!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Starfleet, override us! OVERRIDE…! Yank them
back!</p>
<p><strong>starfleet voice</strong>: Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise….!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: We’re losing the pattern…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need
more signal!</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Oh, no! They’re forming!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh, my God…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet, do you have them?</p>
<p><strong>starfleet voice</strong>: Enterprise… what we got back didn’t
live long. Fortunately.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet… Kirk. Please… express my
condolences to their families. Commander Sonak’s can be reached through
the Vulcan Embassy. There was nothing you could have done, Rand. It
wasn’t your fault.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Turboshaft eight…?</p>
<p><strong>yeoman</strong>: Back that way, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ll have to replace Commander Sonak. I’d
still like a Vulcan there, if possible…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: None available, Captain. There’s no one in
fact, who’s fully rated on this design.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You are, Mister Decker. I’m afraid you’ll have
to double as Science Officer.</p>
<p><strong>81 omitted 81</strong>: - - 84 84</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s all we know about it; except that it’s
now 2.2 days from Earth. Enterprise is the only Federation starship that
stands in its way.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We assume there is a vessel of some type at
the heart of the cloud. Our orders are to intercept, investigate; and
take whatever action is necessary… and possible. …We can only hope that
the life form aboard that vessel reasons as we do.</p>
<p><strong>bridge voice</strong>: Bridge to Captain. Priority signal
from Epsilon Nine –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Put it on the viewer here…!</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: checking console Enterprise… the Cloud is
definitely a powerfield of some kind… Measures… My God! Over 82 A.U.’s
in diameter… Must be something incredible inside there generating it.
We’re transmitting linguacode friendship messages on all frequencies. No
response.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I have a null reading at the center of
the ‘cloud,’ sir.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Definitely something inside.. there but
all scans are being reflected back. Receiving an odd pattern now.. They
seem to be reacting to our scans, sir.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Some kind of energy surge… Enterprise… they
could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act… Deflectors, emergency
full!</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: We are under attack…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: External view…!</p>
<p>****: The above is entirely SILENT, and when it is</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Viewer off.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Pre-launch countdown will commence in forty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott
report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Dock signals clear, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Rely we are holding position awaiting final
crew replacements.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, Transporter Personnel reports the
Navigator… … Lieutenant Junior Grade Ilia is already aboard, and en
route to the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: She’s a Deltan.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And there are no finer navigators in
Starfleet, Commander.</p>
<p>****: Throughout this sequence, Sulu eyes ILIA with</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Hello, Ilia.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Decker….!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I was stationed on the Lieutenant’s home
planet some years ago…</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: ‘Commander’ Decker?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Our Exec and Science Officer…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in
me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And in you, too, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May
I assume my duties?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: By all means.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, Starfleet reports our last six crew
members ready to beam up… … but one of them is refusing to step into the
transporter.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh? I’ll see that he beams up…!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia in hand.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Sir…? Yes, of course… Your pre-programming is
already set in, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: I’m sworn to celibacy, Mister Sulu. That makes
me as safe as any human female.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I now the Captain meant no person- al
insult.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: I would never take advantage of a sexually
immature species. You can assure him that’s true, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>101 int. transporter room 101</strong>: - - 102 102</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yeoman, what was the problem down there?</p>
<p><strong>yeoman</strong>: He insisted we go first, sir. Said something
about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you, Yeoman Starfleet , this is Captain
Kirk. The officer is to be beamed up immediately!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, for a man who swore he’d never return to
Starfleet…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: They didn’t…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, there’s a ‘thing’ out there –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – headed this way. I need you…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, I need you badly.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Permission granted, sir!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All decks, this is the Captain. Prepare or
immediate departure.</p>
<p><strong>105 int. enterprise - montage departure scenes 105</strong>:
- - 108 108 Bulkheads closing, feed lines disengaging, main ENGINES HUM
into life, crew personnel hurrying to launch stations. SHOTS of cargo
deck, down to Engineering Section slamming shut. Drydock area clearing,
work lights go out, warning lights go on.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Dock control reports ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Helm ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Orbital departure on plot, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Yard command signaling clear, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Maneuvering thrusters, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hold station.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thrusters ahead, Mister Sulu. Take us out.</p>
<p><strong>114 closer angles - enterprise 114</strong>: - - 117 117
emphasizing fine detail reality of both drydock and starship as saucer
section emerges. Tiny space- suited human figures watch the departing
ship. CAMERA HOLDS ON STARSHIP until completely clear of the orbital
dock.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Intermix set, Bridge, impulse power at your
discretion.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Impulse power, Mr Sulu. Ahead Warp
point-five.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Departure angle on viewer.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Departure angle.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Viewer ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain’s Log, stardate 7412.6. 2.7 hours from
launch…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … in order to intercept the Intruder at the
earliest possible time, we must now risk engaging Warp drive while still
within the solar system…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain, assuming we have full Warp
capability, accelerating to Warp Seven on leaving solar system will
bring us to IP with the Intruder in twenty point one hours.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Science Officer’s computations confirmed,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities
meet with your approval?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Programming ready?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Program set for standard Warp entry,
Captain…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: … but I still recommend further simulation
study.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mister Decker; every minute brings that object
nearer Earth! Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.</p>
<p><strong>scott’s intercom voice</strong>: Captain, we need further
Warp simulation on the flow sensors…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Engineer, we need Warp speed now!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Hold one minute, please, Captain –</p>
<p><strong>asst.</strong>: That’s it, sir; I can’t do any better.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Aye, lad… It’s borderline on the simulator,
Captain: I canna guarantee that she’ll…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Warp Drive, Mr Scott.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Accelerating to Warp One, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp point seven… point eight … nine…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp One, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Decker –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Wormhole!… Get us back on impulse power! Full
reverse!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse
on impulse power…!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole
effect!</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Collision alert…! Collision
alert…!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Negative control from inertial lag will
continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to
sub-light speed.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Unidentified small object has been pulled into
the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Forcefields up full! Put object on
viewer…!</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Navigational deflectors inoperative…!
Directional control also inoperative, Captain…!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main
power systems…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Time to impact…?</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Twelve seconds…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers…!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Delay that phaser order! Arm photon
torpedoes…!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Photon torpedoes armed…!</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Object is an asteroid, reading mass point
seven… Impact in eight seconds… seven… six… five…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Fire torpedoes…!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Torpedoes away…!</p>
<p><strong>sub-warp effect</strong>: The stars ahead, relatively
station- ary; a feeling of motion, but smooth, visually normal.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: We’re out of it…!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: We are at warp point eight. Position report,
Navigator..?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Helm control restored, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Computing new interception course.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Communications are normal, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Negative damage report, sir. No casualties
reported, sir.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Engineer… report status there.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: In just a second, Exec; we’re picking up the
pieces down here.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scott’s intercom voice</strong>: Captain, it was our
anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It
will happen again if we don’t correct it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That object out there is less than two days
from Earth, Mister Scott. We’ve got to intercept while it still is out
there!</p>
<p><strong>scott’s intercom voice</strong>: Aye, we understand that sir!
We’re doing our best.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Decker, I’d like to see you in my
quarters. You have the conn, Mr. Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Maintaining warp point eight; I show our new
heading as 287 point three Mark 105.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Lieutenant Ilia…?</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Confirmed, Mr. Sulu. Confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser
order countermanded?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases
phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went
into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then you acted properly, of course.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Thank you, sir. I’m sorry I embar- rassed
you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You saved the ship.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’m aware of that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Stop competing with me, Decker!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Permission to speak freely, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Granted.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Sir, you haven’t logged a single star hour
in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship’s
design – in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I trust you will… nursemaid me through these
difficulties, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Yes, sir, I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then I won’t keep you from your duties any
longer, Commander. Yes, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Was he difficult?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: No more than I expected Not as difficult as
this. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: That you left? or that you didn’t say
‘goodbye’?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: If I’d seen you again, would you have been
able to say it?</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Get out of here, Bones.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Make your point, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I intend to keep her, is that what you’re
saying, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s intercom voice</strong>: Bridge to Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Viewer on.</p>
<p><strong>uhura from viewer</strong>: Signal from a
Federation-registered long-range shuttle, sir. She wishes to come
alongside, and lock on.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: It is a courier, Captain. Grade One
priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer
off.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Your… opinion has been noted, Doctor. Is there
anything further?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Permission to come aboard, sir?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Granted, sir! Granted!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock…! Spock, where…how…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Commander, if I may…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have been monitoring your Starfleet
transmissions, Captain, your engine design difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I offer my services as Science Officer.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If our Executive Officer has no
objections…?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Of course not. I’m aware of Mister Spock’s
qualifications.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock’s Starfleet
commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: Mr. Spock…!!!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: That’s how we all feel, Mister…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: With your permission, I will now discuss
these fuel equations with the Engineer.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mister Spock, welcome aboard!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain’s Log. Stardate 7413.4. Thanks to
Mr. Spock’s timely arrival - and assistance…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … we have the engines rebalanced into full
warp capacity. Repair time less than three hours…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … which means we will now be able to intercept
Intruder while still more than a day from Earth.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp point eight… point nine…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp one, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp two, sir… warp three…</p>
<p><strong>scott’s intercom voice</strong>: Engineering to Bridge… New
intermix balance holding steady. She’s not even straining!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Reporting as ordered, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sit down, please.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting
himself from this interview.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I want him here. Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’ve reported that you felt strong thought
emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any
plan, anything to do with Earth?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Negative, Captain. I could sense only what
seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain
nothing more; I understand nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Also – there was nothing in your report about
why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That inquiry invades my personal life,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I inquired about you – learned you were
studying with the Masters…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Your deductions do you credit, Doctor… if
your puerile curiosity does not.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I still contain fragments of my human
half.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And whatever you sensed out here….</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … is my only hope of accomplishing what the
Masters could not.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Let it drop, Bones. You are my Science Officer
– I’ll expect an immediate report on anything further you learn or sense
from here on.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have accepted service here as a Starfleet
officer… sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I know this has been painful, Spock. For me
too. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>157 omitted 157</strong>: - - 159 159</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s voice</strong>: Red alert! Red alert!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Full mag on viewer!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Linguacode?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Continuing friendship messages on all
frequencies, sir.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: All decks and divisions confirm status
red.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We are being scanned, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Do not return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be
misinterpreted as hostility!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud
center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: No response to friendship messages,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Should I go to battle stations, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Negative, We’ll take no prov- ocative
action.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Recommend defensive posture, Captain:
Screens and shields.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No… … that could also be misinter- preted as
hostile, Mr. Decker. Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Twelve power energy field –</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: – twelve power?!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain, we’ve seen what their weapons can
do. Shouldn’t we take every possible precaution – ?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr Decker….</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, I suspect there’s an object at the
heart of that cloud.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If
that order isn’t clear to you…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain, as your Exec, it’s my duty to point
out alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Five minutes to Cloud boundary!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I stand corrected Mr. Decker. Navigator, lay
in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel
to whatever we find in there…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: That measures twelve power? Ten thousands of
starships couldn’t generate that much…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They have… they have been communicating with
us. I sense … puzzlement. Why have we not replied?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Communicated with us how?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Signal medical alert, Mister Chekov!</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Incoming fire. Ahead. Zero, … mark,
zero. Incoming fire. Ahead. Zero, mark, zero.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Forcefields now…! Deflectors up full!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Commencing evasive maneuvers… !</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Forcefields and deflectors up full,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Bypass…! Alternate Integrators!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: The new screens held…!</p>
<p><strong>scott’s intercom voice</strong>: Engineering to bridge; we
cannot hold full power on forcefields; deflector power is down seventy
percent!</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: No, I can stop his pain.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, the Intruder has been attempting to
communicate! Now placing their transmission on the speaker…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … frequency more than one million megahertz
at such high speed their entire message lasts only a millisecond.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I suspect our messages were too slow for them
to be noticed. Programming computer to send linguacode at their
rate.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Here it comes…!</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Incoming fire. Ahead, zero, mark,
zero, point two. Incoming fire. Ahead, zero, zero, mark, zero…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Engineering… what’s happening to our
forcefields?!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Systems are overloading, Captain! Our shields
cannot handle another attack!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Spock?</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Impact in fifteen seconds…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Ten seconds….</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Transmitting…!</p>
<p><strong>ilia’s voice</strong>: … five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It appears that our message has been
understood, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Any reply from them?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Negative, no reply, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, have you sensed anything else?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The ‘puzzlement’ I sensed was fleeting…
minor… … as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Our… ‘insignificance’?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We are obviously confronted by a highly
advanced mentality… yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we
want.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But they understood our messages; they broke
off the attack.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: They may have attacked only as a warning to
us, Captain. To keep away.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That would presuppose a feeling, Commander…
compassion. I sensed no emotion, only… … pure logic.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Tactical plot on viewer.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Opinion, Mister. Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Recommend we proceede, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Decker… ?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I advise caution, Captain; we can’t
withstand another attack.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know
nothing about it yet.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: That’s precisely the point, Captain. We
don’t know it will do. Moving into the cloud – at this time, is an
unwarranted gamble.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How do you define unwarranted, mister?!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You asked my opinion, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Viewer, standard ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No vessel could generate a powerfield of this
magnitude…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns
unrecognizable.</p>

<p><strong>194 various angles on the bridge crew and the viewer

as the Enterprise continues moving toward it. Everyone is awed; even
Spock, from whom we discern an involuntary, impressed reaction. Decker
is with Spock at the science console.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Incredible dimensions, Sir! … I make it as
seventy-eight kilometers in length…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: It could hold a crew of tens of
thousands…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Evaluation, Mister Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That vessel is generating a forcefield
measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth’s sun.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet;
advise we are attempting further communication.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Unable to make contact with Starfleet. Our
transmissions out of the Cloud are being reflected back.</p>
<p><strong>ilia</strong>: Distance to object now seventy- thousand
kilometers…</p>

<p><strong>sulu</strong>: We’re already two settings below that,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in
to one hundred kilometers distance.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: One hundred kilometers…</p>

alert!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: No weapons…!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Security… do not send further teams!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: No intruder readings on other decks,
Captain… Can that be one of their crew?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A probe from their vessel… A plasma-energy
combination…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Don’t interfere with it…!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Absolutely, I will not interfere!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No one interfere…! It doesn’t seem interested
in us – only the ship…!</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’s running our records! Starfleet strength,
Earth defenses…</p>

computer…</p>

don’t break free in fifteen seconds, she’ll burn up…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We cannot break free, Captain. We do not have
a fraction of the power necessary.</p>

drive systems!</p>
<p><strong>237 omitted 237</strong>: - - 238 238</p>

directly at the beam might weaken it just enough for us to break free
–</p>

resistance would not only be futile, Catain…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: We don’t know that, Mr. Spock. Why are you
opposed to trying?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: They’re pulling us inside…!</p>
<p><strong>241 omitted 241</strong>: - - 243 243</p>

could have done that outside.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: They could have many ways of destroying
things, Mr. Decker.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Something about us puzzles them… perhaps even
concerns them.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, photic-sonar readings indicate the

third. Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can’t expect us not to look
them over now!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Thrusters ahead, one third.</p>

It’s closing up…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hold station…!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Thrusters at station keeping…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: All scans are being reflected back, Captain.
Our sensors are useless.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Have you been able to analyze any of
this…?</p>

<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: I have been programmed by V’ger to observe
and record normal functioning of the carbon-based units infesting USS
ENTERPRISE.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who is…‘V’ger’…?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger is that which programmed me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Is V’ger the Captain of the alien vessel?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger is that which seeks the Creator. McCOY
Jim, this is a mechanism…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Where is Lt. Ilia?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: That unit no longer functions. I have been
given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units
infesting Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: “Carbon-based units”…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why does V’ger travel to the third planet of
the solar system directly ahead?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger travels to the third planet to find
the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Find the Creator? What Creator? Whose…!? What
does V’ger want of the ‘Creator’… ?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: To join with him.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Join with the Creator… ? How?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger and the Creator will become One.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Who is the Creator?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: The Creator is that which created V’ger.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who is V’ger?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger is that which seeks the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: I am ready to commence my observations.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe
might provide some insight into those who manufactured it, and how to
deal with them.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: I am programmed to observe and record normal
functioning procedures of the carbon-based units.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The examination is a normal function.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: You may proceede.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: An osmotic micro-pump… here and here. Even
the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated. And every exocrine
system is here, too –</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: – even eye moisture.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Deck – er.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Interesting. Not ‘Decker-unit’?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain… this probe may be a key a key to the
Aliens.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: It’s a programmed mechanism, Mr. Spock…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We have just seen that its body duplicates
our navigator in precise detail. Suppose that beneath its programming,
the real Ilia’s memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: They had a pattern to follow…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … they may have followed it too
precisely.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ilia’s memory, her feelings of loyalty,
friendship, obedience… might all be there.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Exactly. And you did have a ‘relationship’
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: That probe in there – in a different form
now – is the same thing that killed Ilia!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Commander, we’re locked in an alien vessel,
six hours from Earth orbit, our only contact with our captors is the
probe. If we can control it, persuade it, use it in some way…</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: I have recorded enough here. You will now
assist me further.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The Decker-unit can assist you with much
greater efficiency…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Carry on with your assignment, Mr. Decker.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock? Concerned about his chances?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am uneasy with that being our only hope of
more information.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain’s Log. Stardate 7414.1. Our best
estimates place us some four hours from Earth. No significant Ilia
memory patterns within the alien probe. This remains our only means of
contact with our captor.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: All these vessels were called
“Enterprise”.</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s intercom voice</strong>: Bridge to Captain…</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s intercom voice</strong>: Kirk here.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: A faint signal from Starfleet, sir. They have
the intruder on their monitors… They show us… three hours… twenty-four
minutes from Earth!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: The carbon units use this area for
recreation… What type of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel
enjoy…?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: The words ‘recreation’ and ‘enjoy’ have no
meaning to my programming.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Ilia ‘enjoyed’ this game… she nearly always
won –</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: This device serves no purpose.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Damn…!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: The crews of the previous Enterprises were
also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel
different?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Carbon units are not true life forms… Do
those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present
form?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Carbon units have clearly retarded
Enterprise’s proper evolvement.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: What is Enterprise’s proper evolvement?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Enterprise should not require the presence
of carbon units.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Enterprise would be unable to function
without carbon units.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: More data concerning this functioning is
necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: When my examination is complete, the carbon
units will be reduced to data patterns.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Within you are memory patterns of a carbon
unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our
functions better.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: That is logical. You may procede.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Computer, commence recording. Captain Kirk –
this message will detail my attempt to contact the aliens…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength…
They – have Intruder on their monitors – it’s decelerating – powerfield
cloud beginning to dissipate…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate
Intruder on a course into Earth orbit…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a
thruster suit is reported missing!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock…! Get a fix on his position!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … I don’t want him stopped, Bones; I want him
to lead me to whatever’s out there…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then he’ll have still led me to it, won’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>sulu’s voice</strong>: Bridge, Captain. We make Spock as 26
Mark 345 degrees off ship’s axis.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I have him in sight.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: I remember Lt. Ilia once mentioning that she
wore this…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: … when we met.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: Ilia…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: On Delta… remember…?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Dr. Chapel…</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: “Will…”</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Ilia, help us make direct contact with
V’ger…</p>
<p><strong>“ilia</strong>: I… cannot.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Then tell us who V’ger is; where he’s from…
W need your help.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Why have two carbon units entered
V’ger…?</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: They want to make contact with V’ger…
“Ilia’s” memory again; Ilia…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: distressed, Does V’ger object to the
presence of the two carbon units?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: The carbon units are of no consequence;
V’ger will determine their purpose.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: That is also V’ger’s purpose.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You said V’ger’s purpose was to find and
join with the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: That is how V’ger will survive.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: I wish to continue my observations.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bridge…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: … stand by, I may be in trouble…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Your phaser, Captain…! Use your phaser…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: Can’t… reach… phas –</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Airlocks two and four – prepare to launch
rescue teams! Chief Lang! Get them out there! Fast!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Mr. Spock, the Captain is in trouble, directly
behind you – three hundred meters! Mr. Spock!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: … Spock…! … need help…! …
trapped…!</p>
<p>****: … pressure on me…! … can’t move…! Spock…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bridge, cancel rescue teams. Spock, what in
the hell are you doing out here!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am seeking answers, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma – or your
personal one?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, I believe there we will find an
indication of whoever – or whatever – is aboard this vessel…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It would appear that the atomic arrays of
these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And these ‘sensor-swarms’ collect that data,
carry it here.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: New crystals: they must contain the most
recent data obtained –</p>
<p><strong>rapid</strong>: PROFUSION OF FAINT IMAGES, but this time
including a pattern-like image of Klingons, Klingon vessels , and
obvious Starfleet personnel – and the Epsilon 9 station. Also, a</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Klingons… our Epsilon 9 station … and Ilia!!
They seem to be more than just images…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them
wasn’t simply a weapon – it dematerialized them, stored them. But
why?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If this is their ship’s data banks, where is
the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, I do not believe there is a crew –
or that this is a vessel as such.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am almost certain now that all of this is
V’ger – I believe that we are inside a life form, a living machine.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I must attempt mindmeld with it, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, if you’re right, its mind may be
enormous…</p>
<p><strong>camera bridging back out through spock’s eyes and
into</strong>: ANGLE ON SPOCK’S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed. His
eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a catatonic state,
completly unaware of his surroundings. Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO
SCENE, moving a medical scanner over the brain area.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber
connection…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Jim…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: This simple feeling… … is so far beyond
V’ger’s comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Were you right? Spock? V’ger is a living
machine…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A life form of its own; a conscious, living
entity.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: A living machine…?!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And it considers the Enterprise a living
machine: that’s why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.</p>
<p><strong>chapel</strong>: If it thinks our ship is alive what does it
think we are?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I saw V’ger’s planet: a planet populated by
living machines. Unbelievable technology. V’ger has knowledge that spans
this universe. And… in all this order… all this magnificence, V’ger
feels no awe…no delight… no beauty… I should have known…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Know what, Spock? What?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What should you have known?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: No meaning… No hope… And, Jim, no answers…!
Jim, it’s looking for answers itself!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What answers?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: ‘Is this all I am? Is there not more?’</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s voice</strong>: A faint signal from Starfleet, sir!
Intruder Cloud has been located on their outer monitors for past
twenty-seven minutes… dissipating rapidly as it approaches.</p>
<p><strong>sulu’s voice</strong>: Starfleet reports forward velocity has
slowed to sub-warp speed! We are three minutes from Earth’s orbit!-</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’ll be right there… I need Spock on the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: A machine planet…? Sending a machine to Earth
looking for its Creator…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: ‘To find the Creator,’ the probe said. Find
God…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov, Commander Decker’s present
location?</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s voice</strong>: He… they… are in Engineering,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I want to make a ship’s announcement. But it’s
to be heard only in Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s voice</strong>: Ready, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: This is the Captain speaking. It appears that
the alien ship… V’ger… is NOT a manned vessel…</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: It is a living entity…! A machine life
form. We are attempting to ascertain its intentions. All personnel will
maintain yellow alert status!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: A machine…! Then it had to be programmed. By
whom…?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: By the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: To join, and become One with the
Creator?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: To learn all that is learnable; to deliver
all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the
programming.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Well, sir, now what about all that? A living
entity, the Captain says… entity… A living thing…!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Thank you, Scotty…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Your welcome, sir.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: There is no logical reason for carbon units
to control Enterprise’s power systems.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Lassie, if I were functioning ‘logically,’
right now I’d be showing you the inside of our scrap metal
compactor!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: We’re now locked into Starfleet’s
transceivers; Admiral Nogura has received your reports, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: The visual is a lunar monitor relay, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Heavy interference, sir – it’s coming from
here, inside the intruder itself…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Puzzling! The interference appears to be a
rather simple carrier wave code signal…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: On an old style radio frequency, sir…</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: As I stated, V’ger calls to the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: V’ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir
– that it’s ready to deliver the information it was programmed to
collect…</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: ‘To learn all that is learnable.’</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: It expects a return signal now, ordering it
to transmit that information to the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Sir! V’ger’s signals have stopped…</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Decker… The Creator has not responded.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Picking up Starfleet again; a lunar monitor
relay…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: These read as identical composition… …
however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: High mag, Mr. Sulu!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: The third one is moving off too – a fourth one
is forming…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Urgent signal from Starfleet, Captain! All
Earth defense systems have gone dead.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Sir, Starfleet computes their trajectories as
moving toward equidistant positions over Earth.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: From four equidistant positions, Captain, a
detonation would blanket the entire surface of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>difalco</strong>: I plot them as reaching equidistant
positions in… twenty-nine minutes, sir… mark!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why…?!</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: The carbon-units infection will now be
removed from the Creator’s planet.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: The Creator has not answered.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The carbon-units are not responsible for
that.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: You infest and control Enterprise. V’ger
believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Then V’ger believes the Creator to be a
machine too.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: It seems we all imagine God in our own
image.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Of course: we all create God in our own
image.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: V’ger! If we are lesser beings, we are still,
like you, living. And because we are alive, we – like you – wish to
survive. You must not destroy –</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain… Treat V’ger as you would… a
child.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Child…!?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into
adulthood – learning, searching – instinctively needing.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Needing what…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It doesn’t know what it needs, Comm ander… It
does not know.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The carbon–units-know-why-the
Creator-has-not-responded.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Ilia… we can help V’ger find what it needs
–</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Disclose the information.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Not until V’ger withdraws the devices orbiting
the third planet.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No. Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Bridge to all decks,secure your
stations.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Clear the bridge, Captain…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>damage tech.</strong>: Severe stress on engine pylons,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger requires the information.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bridge secure all stations! Move out!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: All ship’s functions going to automatic,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If V’ger destroys the Enterprise, the
information V’ger requires will also be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: It is illogical to withhold required
information.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Kirk-unit, why do you not disclose
information?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Because V’ger is going to destroy all the
carbon units on the third planet.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: They have repressed the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The information will not be disclosed.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger needs the information.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then V’ger must withdraw its orbiting
devices.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger will comply if the carbon units
disclose the information.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, the vessel – V’ger – obviously
operates from a central brain complex…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The orbiting devices would be controlled from
the point, then…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The carbon units’ information cannot be
disclosed to V’ger’s probe… only to V’ger directly.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Forward motion, Captain…!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A tractor beam…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain, what’s the next move?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The question is, Mr. Decker, is there a next
move…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Resume duty stations, Mr. Decker.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: All personnel resume stations…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being
called.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: I’m afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.
But it’s the only game in town.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
activate?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: They reach final position in… Twenty-seven
minutes – mark.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Engineering…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Scott, here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute Starfleet
order two zero zero five.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: When, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s intercom voice</strong>: On my command.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Why has the Captain ordered self- destruct,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I would say, lass, because he thinks – he
hopes – that when we go up… we’ll take V’ger with us.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Will we?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: When that much matter and anti- matter are
brought together? Oh, yes; we will, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Twenty-five minutes to device activation,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Starfleet has been apprised of our situation,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Tractor beam remains constant…</p>
<p><strong>difalco</strong>: We are seventeen kilometers inside the
vessel…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock… Spock…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Spock – I think…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Not for us?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: No, Captain, not for us… for V’ger.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I weep for V’ger, as I would for a brother –
far more knowledgeable than I – and yet one step behind.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: As I was – when I came aboard… so is V’ger
now: empty, incomplete. Searching. Logic and knowledge are not
enough.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Has not, Doctor – and now, because of what we
are planning… will not…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There is no alternative.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Mr. Spock, what would V’ger need to fulfill
itself?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: V’ger has begun to understand the true limits
of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To
fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V’ger believes this
can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Each of us, at some time in our life, turns
to someone, a father, a brother, a God and asks ‘Why am I here?’ ‘What
was I meant to be?’ V’ger hopes to touch its Creator to find its
answers.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: ’Is this all that I am? Is there nothing
more?</p>
<p><strong>difalco</strong>: Captain…!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, I believe that is our
destination.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Forward motion slowing, Captain…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Engineering… Status, Mr. Scott?</p>
<p><strong>scott’s intercom voice</strong>: We’re ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Tractor beam strength lessening,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott… on my next signal.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, the orbital device will not be
triggered for twenty-two minutes…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The point…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The point is, Captain, twenty-two</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: , if we do not provide V’ger with certain
information, we won’t have twenty-two seconds; the plan must be
implemented upon arrival.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain, we can’t be sure that our… move…
will actually save Earth.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Forward motion stopped, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Tractor beam is released.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: V’ger…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Captain… I read an oxygen and gravity
envelope forming outside the Enterprise…!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Sir, I have located the source of V’ger’s
radio signal: directly ahead.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That transmitter is a vital link between
V’ger and the Creator.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: We have twenty-one minutes. Captain, we can
still save V’ger… and ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: The carbon units will now provide V’ger the
required information.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott… we’re holding off; there may be a
chance… Spock, Bones…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Decker… I will contact you every five
minutes. Otherwise… inform Mr. Scott immediately.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain… I’d like to go along…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, you have the conn…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: V’ger plans to literally meld to reduce both
itself and the Creator to patterns…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … and then to reassemble itself combined with
the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator’s
answers.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Our data is being prepared.</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: Answer!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We will answer and present proof of our answer
when it is ready!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: V’ger, we will bring the Creator to you!
Here!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: We need only a few more minutes. Believe
me…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Ilia, believe me… the Creator will
appear!</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s intercom voice</strong>: Enterprise to Captain…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Problem, Captain: the response signal is not
in our records. Voyager Six was sent out by Earth’s “United States
Subdivision.’ The code was probably…</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s intercom voice</strong>: … kept secret to keep
Voyager’s data from rival subdivisions.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s intercom voice</strong>: We are now checking with
Starfleet Archives, Captain. Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: And when V’ger melds? What will happen to
you?</p>
<p><strong>“ilia”</strong>: It will… take me from you…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There’s no way to know. V’ger expected it to
be a machine – some single entity. All of us here may be reduced into
patterns…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That seems to be what it has planned – to
have the Creator physically present here.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Commander…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Kirk here.</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s intercom voice</strong>: We now have the response
code, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Stand by. Transmit it on my orders.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enterprise… transmit.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Recording…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enterprise, are you transmitting?</p>
<p><strong>uhura’s intercom voice</strong>: Affirmative, Captain. For
some time now.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Confirm code and transmitting frequency.</p>
<p><strong>chekov’s intercom voice</strong>: Both signal and frequency
confirmed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: Captain Kirk!</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: The fault is here, sir, not in the
transmission. The antenna leads have been disconnected. V’ger never
intended to accept a transmitted signal.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Capture God! In order to retrieve V’ger’s
data, the Creator has to physically come here!…</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: And plug the signal directly into the
circuitry at this… … point here, Captain. It should pick up even a
tricorder playback.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enterprise, I want that signal again.
Transmit!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Jim… he wants it.</p>
<p><strong>decker</strong>: You got the Enterprise, it’s what you
wanted. This is what I want. But, Jim… … I’m the right choice for this
mission.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, we were its answer!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the
fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … and the ‘foolish’ emotions which drive
us?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I prefer your poet Dante’s phrase – ‘the
divine restlessness of the human spirit.’</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Starfleet signal, Captain! Return to orbital
dockyard for inspection.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ignore that signal. Shall we give the
Enterprise a proper shakedown, Mr. Scott?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I’d say it’s time for that, I would, sir. We
can have you back on Vulcan in four days, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have no business on Vulcan, Engineer.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ahead Warp One, Mr. Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>difalco</strong>: Heading, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Out there. Thataway.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A most logical choice, Captain.</p>
