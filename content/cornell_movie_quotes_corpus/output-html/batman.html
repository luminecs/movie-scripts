<h1 id="batman">batman</h1>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: For God’s sake, Harold, can we please just get
a taxi??</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m trying to get a –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’re going the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Put that away. We’ll look like tourists.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Seventh is that way.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I know where we are!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?</p>
<p><strong>derelict</strong>: Mister. How about it. One dollar? One
dollar, man. Are you deaf? Are you deaf? – Do you speak English??</p>
<p><strong>street punk</strong>: Do the kid a favor, lady. Don’t
scream.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All right. The Gold Card. Don’t leave home
without it.</p>
<p><strong>clang</strong>: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses
up.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Let’s beat it, man. I don’t like being up
here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What, scared of heights?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I dunno, man. After what happened to Johnny
Gobs –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a
roof, all right? No big loss.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That ain’t what I heard. That ain’t what I
heard at all. I heard the bat got him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Gimme a break, will you? Shut up…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Five stories, straight down. There was no
blood in the body.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No shit. It was all over the pavement.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There was no blood, man. My brother says… all
the bad things you done… they come back and haunt you…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Listen to this. How old are you? There ain’t
no bat.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: My brother’s a priest, man.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No wonder you’re such a chickenshit. Now shut
up. There ain’t no bat.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You shouldn’ta turned the gun on that kid,
man. You shouldn’ta –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you want this money or don’t you? Now shut
up! Shut up –</p>
<p><strong>this action is so smooth, so automatic, that the bat
does</strong>: NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and
CHARGES past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I won’t kill you. I want you to do me a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: … it is no longer enough to go after the
small-time punks and petty criminals who infest the streets of Gotham
City. Crime and corruption must be attacked at the root!</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: If elected, my first act as district attorney
will be to return an indictment against Boss Carl Grissom!</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: Together we can make Gotham city a safe place
for decent people to live and work and play.</p>
<p><strong>jack napier</strong>: Decent people shouldn’t live here.
They’d be much happier someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: Anything new?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The usual gas. If this clown could lay a hand
on Grissom… I would’ve had to kill him by now.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: If Grissom knew about us… he might kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t think so, angel. I’m too valuable.
That’s the way I’ve planned it. And besides, he doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: You look just fine, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … I didn’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: That one there won’t say a word. The other
one’s raving his head off.</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: Variety, huh? The spice of life.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: They found him hugging a drainpipe. He
was scared to come off the roof.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Great, but tell me: is this another
you-know-what? ’Cause if so, it’s the third one this week.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: I dunno. What’s “what”?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Good answer. I’m gonna put you in for a
commendation.</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: Oh Christ, it’s Knox.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Hiya, gents. This anything I should know
about?</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: Nothing out of the routine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A bat, I tell you, a giant bat! He wanted me
to do him a favor…!</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing
something up there.</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: No comment. Print what you like.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat
in Gotham City?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You didn’t show up.</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: We had another bat sighting.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sure that was vitally important. Listen:
things are heating up. Someone is leaking information to Harvey
Dent.</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: I’m doing the best I can. If it’s a
problem –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Eckhardt… our problems are your problems.</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: I’ll work on it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
ostentatious on a cop’s salary, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re a smart boy, Eckhardt. You should be
thinking about the future.</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: Ambition. Forget it, Jack. You’ll never
run that organization.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: You’re a psycho, friend. You’re an A-one
crazy boy and Grissom knows it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here. Use mine.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: What have you got for me, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>colleague</strong>: Hey Knox, you got a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: I’m real busy, Clark. Be a pal and dust him,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>colleague</strong>: This one you might want to dust
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: … Vicki Vale.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: How’d you know it was me?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Honey – I would know any randomly selected
square inch of Vicki Vale. If I had a good enough hint.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: A nice, restful vacation.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: God, a girl could get hurt doing this.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I do get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Got any more of those?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Nothing I’m at liberty to reveal here. What’s
new and hot in Gotham City?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: It’s too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat
that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Evildoers, huh? Big or small?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Small so far. I mean – they don’t allow bats
in boardrooms, do they.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Speaking of which… I hear the notorious Bruce
Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
law’n’order freak in the city’s gonna be there.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Well, I’m starving. Will you at least buy me a
hamburger?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yes, but please – be gentle.</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Nine points ahead in the new poll. I don’t
like the way this is shaping up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We can always pop him. – Or pop someone close
to him.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Let’s feed him to the bat.</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: He’s going after our front companies.
Specifically Ace Chemical. Which would tie us in with Councilman Kane,
Senator Miller… on up the line. We have to clean out our files before
the subpoena comes down.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: How do we go? The usual fire?</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: I’m thinking break-in. Trash the office,
remove the relevant documents…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Industrial espionage.”</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: That’s right. And Jack – I’d like you to
handle this operation personally.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Me?</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you’d mind
waiting in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why do you need me to handle a simple
break-in?</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Because I want someone I can trust.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Jack. Don’t forget your lucky deck.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: How high up would you say that is?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I’d say about thirty feet, sir.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: You know, if you cut your bathroom in half,
you’d have my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Which bathroom is that, air?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: The small one.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Some. I am a rich bitch, remember. I’m
quoting.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Yeah, I guess we move in different circles. –
Though I did meet a one-eyed pimp last week.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Commissioner Gordon! What do you hear from our
pointy-eared friend?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Knox, for the ninth time, and you can quote
me – there is no bat.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Aww, Commissioner. There’s gotta be one honest
cop in Gotham city.</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: How’s your luck, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Mr. Dent. What’s your stand on winged
vigilantes?</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: Mr. Knox, I think we have enough real problems
in this city without worrying about ghosts and goblins and Halloween
characters.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: My question is, where does one man get all
this junk.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: All over the world. They say he spends most
of the year overseas – until recently, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Just what I’ve heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old
money and lots of it.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Likes to kill?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Women find him magnetic.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: I bet they like him for his big charity
balls.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: That, and the sweet smell of two hundred
million bucks.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Well, you know me. The more they’ve got, the
less they’re worth. This guy must be the most worthless man in
America.</p>
<p><strong>bruce wayne</strong>: You disappoint me. Why not the
world?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: I assume in my usual charming manner I’ve just
insulted the host. Alexander Knox.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Bruce Wayne. – I’ve read your work. I quite
like it.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Great. Give me a grant.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I might consider it if you introduce me to
Miss Vale.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: “This is Miss Vale.” – That felt
redundant.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You’re just back from Corto Maltese. I saw
your combat photos. Quite a departure for you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: That’s intriguing. They haven’t been
published yet.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: … You have an extraordinary eye.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Some people think she has two.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Don’t mind my friend. He’s a little nervous
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t… seek publicity. – Will you be
staying in Gotham for a while?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: As far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good. Then with any luck we’ll run into each
other.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was
compelled to leave – very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his
regrets.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Thank you, Alfred. I hope you’ll excuse me.
It was a great pleasure meeting you. And you.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: I know the rich are different, but that guy is
real different.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: What were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yum, yum.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Well, he must like the way he looks. He’s got
a mirror in every room.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I get it. Bruce Vain.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: … anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
Chemical Company.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Good Lord, it we could put our hands on Jack
Napier… Why wasn’t I told about this? Who’s in charge of the –</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Lt. Eckhardt, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Eckhardt. Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: Shoot to kill.</p>
<p><strong>safecracker</strong>: … Empty.</p>
<p><strong>hood i</strong>: Just like the file cabinets.</p>
<p><strong>hood ii</strong>: I don’t get it. If this place is cleaned
out already, what do we need five men?</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: What are you trying to do, blow the
collar?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You men are dismissed. We’ll take over from
here. Any man who opens fire on Jack Napier… will answer to me.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>eckhardt</strong>: Nice work, Commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m in charge here. Not Carl Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: My God… it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>hood v</strong>: Let him go or I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>hood v</strong>: Nobody makes a move. We go out clean.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: … Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I don’t know, but he’s one hell of a
showman.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Commissioner. Do us both a favor. Don’t tell
me some lie you’ll have to retract later.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Guess who’s got a date with Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up and asked
you for a date?… Shit.</p>
<p><strong>hey miranda! c’mere!</strong>: I want you to pay close
attention to this. Miranda – tell my friend here what you told me about
Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You mean Mister One-Nighter?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Yeah. “Mister One-Nighter.” Because that’s the
average length of his relationships with women.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: The current record is almost two weeks.
That cover girl – what’s her name? You must’ve shot her, Vicki –</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Tell her about the peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Peanuts?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes through
women.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Like Planter’s Peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Plain or roasted? Alex, I’m very flattered
that you’ve gone out and done all this research.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Why? Aw, come on, Vicki, I’m a reporter. I’m
curious. I do this for a living. – What’d you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I told him yes.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: … What was that?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That was one of the most gracious fuck-yous
it’s ever been my pleasure to watch. – What a nice girl.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Miranda, I’m busy. Go be productive.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Do you sail?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Too much work. I’m not really the physical
type. – Thank you, Alfred.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You do a very convincing imitation. Mm, this
is tasty. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Two drinks and I start swinging from the
rooftops. Tell me, Vicki. There’s something I’m very curious about. What
took you down to Corto Maltese?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: … I guess I needed a change.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You were one of the most successful magazine
photographers in the city. Everyone wanted you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not since the shooting started.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: We went there once when I was little. I
played on the beach. And at nights – they had a band – I danced with my
father on the hotel patio. That was Corto Maltese. When the war broke
out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time… I wouldn’t
look away.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: … Terror.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: There’s terror everywhere. Some types are
just more – familiar than others.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to – I know it all
seems a million miles away, out here on the water, with all this –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Insulation?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Bruce, really, when I say these things I
don’t mean to criticize you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I think you see things very clearly.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m happy to talk about something else. I
don’t want to be depressing.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Do you assume that if I know you better I
won’t like you as much?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are you like
this with the other women you know? – Because I just can’t seem to get a
handle on this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or…
ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible
interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn’t sound that way… that’s
how I’ll mean it.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: – but it’s not fair. I’m half drunk and
you’re not even –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Would you like me to take you home?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want
to get two drinks in you. As an experiment.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Maybe we should just kiss.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: … We could try that.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, Mr. Napier, let’s see how we did.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mirror.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mirror.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You understand the facial muscles were
completely severed –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: hands behind his head, staring up at the
ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Nice hair, dude!</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: That you, sugar bumps?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s me. “Sugar Bumps.”</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Jack? Thank God. I can’t believe it’s you.
I heard you’d been –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is that what you “heard”?</p>
<p><strong>you set me up!</strong>: Over a girl. You must be insane!</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Sooner or later you would’ve tried to take
me, Jack. You may get me now, but your life won’t be worth a dime.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ve died once already. It wasn’t so bad. – In
fact I recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Jack, listen – we’ll cut a deal –</p>
<p><strong>the cackle builds into furious, hysterical
laughter.</strong>: GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away
from the desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.</p>
<p><strong>grissom</strong>: Jack – I’m warning you. WIPE THAT</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: HA! That’s the best part. I CAN’T!!</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: What a view. Our little city. It always

<p><strong>batman</strong>: Better. It’s not on the market yet.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: It doesn’t protect your head, though.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: That’s why I wear a target on my chest.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: How’d you find this place?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Stumbled across it when I was a boy.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I don’t like bats. Not that kind.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: They used to terrify me. But I forced myself
to keep coming back, and – – I guess I became the thing I feared the
most. I’ll do your photos now.</p>

shipment, every warehouse, every loading dock. Nothing. No opportunities
for tampering. Somehow the Joker is supplying tainted ingredients… at
the source.</p>

database you want? Anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then I tap
into the FBI. – Your photos are ready.</p>

took me there. Because he’s trying to tell me.</p>

can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets once
and for all. I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away
from Vicki.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can’t do that. Not while the Joker’s still
out there.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Then stay away from Vicki. That’s all I want,

Batman. The apartment was booby-trapped with the Joker’s laughing gas,
leaving 17 policemen dead. Also found dead at the scene was Alicia Hunt,
26, a former model –</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: … Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: My name is Bruce Wayne. You’re welcome to
stay here as long as you want.</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: We’ll send a team into Ace the moment the
warrant comes through.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He’ll be ready when you do. Remember what
happened at the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I suggest a nice big bomb.</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne.
– We do have laws.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Then for God’s sake, Harvey, cancel the
anniversary celebration.</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: We’ve told him we’ll deal. What could he
possibly have to gain by –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Do you still think the Joker cares about
money??</p>
<p><strong>dent</strong>: I don’t know. I’m just a D.A. I don’t have
access to all your expert sources.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: … Your butler wouldn’t gimme a ride so I
figured I’d hoof it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sorry. I can’t let you leave.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You can’t keep me here, man. That’s
kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: If I let you leave, you’ll do the same thing
again. You’ll go after the Joker… and you’ll wind up dead.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Hey, man. Look at you. You’re rich. You got
everything you want. How do you know what’s in my mind?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t care what’s in your mind. You’re
staying.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: … You’re him.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s all right, Alfred. Everything’s under
control.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: … Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs, I’m here
to tell you… we have had one helluva quarter.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Look at that, folks. We got ’em rolling in
the aisles!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: All this apparatus, Vicki… this house, and
the money, and the power… it was never mine. It was something I
inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited. All I ever hoped for
was someone who could see through Bruce – who could see me – and not be
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m not frightened of you, Bruce. I’m
frightened for you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: In all these years… why couldn’t I see how it
would turn out?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Where’s the boy?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Upstairs. He’s quite docile.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I know that feeling. It won’t last.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He’ll be taken care of financially. Beyond
that… you know what to do. Don’t let all this go to waste.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Boston, Philly: loading bay one.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: … Detonate.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Good Lord!</p>
<p><strong>governor gilroy</strong>: As Governor of this great state, it
is now my honor to unveil for you a very special lady – a lady who
stands tall for life and liberty – America’s favorite lady… LADY</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here’s a little token
of my esteem. HAVE FUN… ’cause THE PARTY’S ON ME!</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yeah. Deja vu.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: What do you say? Let’s head for the
lights.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: So much for Underdog.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He’s got the
balloons rigged with compressor tanks!!</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Jesus Christ, the guy’s a genius.</p>
<p><strong>look! it’s bruce!!</strong>: Allie – the balloons. We’ve got
to find some way to tell him!</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Great. How??</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: No… NOOOOO!!!</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: There. There. – GET ’EM!!</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: God yes, Allie. I’ve gotta say – that was the
ballsiest move I ever –</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Holy shit. Holy –</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: Jesus, Vicki.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: He’ll be back… he’ll be back!!</p>
<p><strong>batwing</strong>: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the
asphalt SEAM running up Broad Avenue – half in, half out of the
tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: You do him. I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yo.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Now we’re even, huh? Even up.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: How did you…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I hitched. MOVE IT!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: The Joker. Is he –?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Forget it. Relax. … He’s mine now.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: I’m in the belltower. Don’t land.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: … Batman?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Mad… man…</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Well now, you’re not exactly the picture of
mental health, are you.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: … Murderer…</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Bruce, we’re both murderers. Think how many
people you’ve killed by letting me live.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No… sense… of humor?</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: As the details of the Joker’s heinous
plan become known, a city’s gratitude goes out to the mysterious Batman.
His whereabouts remain unknown, but Batman – if you’re alive – if you’re
listening – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I loved you too.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I’m afraid
he’s quite unreachable.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I don’t know why I’m doing this. I half wish
you’d stay a cripple.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Ohhhh… you don’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I don’t, but… I do. It’s just… I love you,
Bruce. I –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of
me?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I guess you did it, didn’t you. You saved
everyone. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t know how to explain this so it makes
sense… but you saved me.</p>
