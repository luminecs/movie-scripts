<p><strong>jake</strong>: So I’m dead…</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley- night</strong>: Dumpsters overflow with
the day’s garbage. A pillar of steam rises from an underground grate.
It’s the dark place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.
We see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20’s whose fashionable suit and good
looks are in obvious contrast to the surroundings– At first glance,
you’d think he could run for Congress some day. At first glance. Jake
faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution style. His face gives
away nothing– He could be kneeling in a strawberry field.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And I think it’s because of this redhead…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Know who I am, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The Anti-Christ?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No. I’m not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of
Darkness. I’m just a guy looking for some answers. Things are probably
going to end badly for you, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Gee… What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Your life flashing before your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just the last three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: That’s not a bad place to start.</p>
<p><strong>ext . - back alley- night</strong>: Title: Three Weeks Ago…
The same alley… The door of a building bursts open as LIONEL DOLBY ,
dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles out breathing heavy. The dim light of
a bare bulb glares off the sweat on his forehead. A moment later, Jake
emerges from the same door carrying a large black revolver.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I lost my head. I’m… Sorry. I don’t know what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Y-y-you fucking shot him! That’s what
happened!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I had to! That motherfucker was about to
welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: I can’t be here! You understand? I can’
t–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Oh Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: LISTEN to me! We don’t have much time. We can
still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: What– What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>int. - the euclid bar</strong>: A dive furnished with a few
mismatched chairs and a bar. A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner
table with face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel
Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway. MILES, late 20’s,
wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the edge of the bar are two
briefcases, both open, both filled with neat stacks of blood splattered
money. A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood. Jake
grabs the Dead Guy’s legs as Lionel watches in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come on. Grab his arms.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Lionel… He’s dead. Yeah, maybe you didn’t pull
the trigger, but you were standing right there and watched me do it.
Help me. Grab his arms.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Tick-tock…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut
up.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Your mess.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then shut up.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: My place.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Miles lets out a little chuckle; it’s
just enough to set Jake off again. Jake pulls the gun and points it at
Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Oh please… You think this kinda shit hasn’t
happened here before? Given it’s usually on Thursdays. And usually, I
gotta tell the cops, “No, Officer… I didn’t really get a good look at
the shooters.” Usually anyway.</p>
<p><strong>patron</strong>: I didn’t see nothing. And I swear if you let
me go now, I won’t say-</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Relax, porkchop.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: I can’t be here!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then go.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: What about… The money?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What about this situation makes you think I
can answer that question right now?</p>
<p><strong>ext.- the euclid/city sidewalk- night</strong>: Lionel
emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar to street-level just
as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt in front of the bar, lights
flashing, SIREN WAILING. On the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK
POLICE</p>
<p><strong>department.</strong>: Lionel does his best to look casual as
TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid. One of
the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder. The last thing
Lionel hears before he turns a corner–</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Everybody FREEZE!</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid</strong>: OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a
middle aged cop with a couple of spare tires, stands by the front door
with his gun drawn, in a dramatic stance.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: I said, freeze you motherfucking,
cocksucking, scumbags!</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: We’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: Or I’ll blow off every one of your
fucking heads!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Stop waving that thing around.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You sure we’re clear?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Guy looked like he was trying not to shit
himself. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>dead guy</strong>: What took so fucking long?</p>
<p><strong>dead guy/gordo</strong>: I’ve been lying in this shit like
half the night.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You guys were late. We had to go to a Mexican
stand-off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And you know I hate guns.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: We were fighting crime.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Keeping the city streets safe for drug
dealers and pedophiles everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I told you, use less powder.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: But you won’t get that splatter effect.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then these go into your cut.</p>
<p><strong>big al</strong>: Hey, Jake… When am I gonna get to play the
Inside?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Gordo plays the inside. You’re the Shill.</p>
<p><strong>big al</strong>: Yeah, but come on… All I get to do is cry
and get insulted.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you talking about? You should get a
fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do. We got it down cold,
Al. You don’t want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?</p>
<p><strong>big al</strong>: I’ m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want
eggrolls?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What? I can feel you looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: That’s a lot of cash. He came up with it
pretty quick.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Probably some investment banker or
convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of
here? It’s done. He’s not coming back.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody
mess up the hoop?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake rubber bands two small wads of cash
and hands them to Rottovich and Sobozinski.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ten percent.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: You guys got sack, I’ll give you that
much.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Confidence. It’s just confidence.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Feels a little light, Jake. Next time
we’re in for twenty.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Twenty? My ass!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you talking about? Ten’s
standard.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Yeah Well, Sobo’s kid needs braces.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: Do you have any idea what those monks
charge for that medieval torture?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We got a good thing going here. You want to
blow it over an overbite?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, Jake. I like you
boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say?
Twenty percent’s still better than what we give to any of the other
criminals.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All the shit we pulled with you and you’re
trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Was that a threat? Did I hear a
threat?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ROTTOVICH</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Cops…</p>
<p><strong>ext. back alley- night</strong>: Butch shaking his head,
still holding the gun.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Grifters…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We can’t all be model citizens such as
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s all about the money, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Isn’t it always?</p>
<p><strong>int.- four seasons hotel- night</strong>: A suite in the
upscale hotel. Miles answers a KNOCK on the door– An expensive CALL GIRL
stands at the door in an overcoat.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s what makes us run. And despite what they
say, it can buy you love.</p>
<p><strong>call girl</strong>: Are you ready for me, Ralph?</p>
<p><strong>int.- prada store- night</strong>: Gordo stands in front of a
mirror trying on a new suit. The sales people fawn over him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It can buy you a new and better you.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: I just don’t know if this says, “me”. What’s
the fabric?</p>
<p><strong>int.- big al’s apartment- night</strong>: Big Al has a
cordless phone to his ear…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It can erase all those things about you that
you wish didn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>big al</strong>: It’s Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven’t
been ducking you. I told you I’d get it.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- soho street- night</strong>: Jake walks down the
crowded street, passing the bars and restaurants of SoHo. His jacket’s
buttoned up to hide the blood stains.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It can make you think you’re on top of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake’s smile fades as he watches her
saunter into the bar, but not before she throws him another glance over
her shoulder. Jake continues on into…</p>
<p><strong>int.- neighborhood bar- continuous</strong>: A semi-crowded
bar. Not hip and trendy like “Wax.” Jake finds an empty stool at the end
of the bar and orders a drink. He takes a second to look around at the
cliques of people talking, laughing, having a good time before he pulls
a newspaper out his coat pocket. Jake takes a pen from the bar and opens
to the crossword section.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And if you believe that money can do all that
for you, you’re the perfect mark. Jack Kerouac said that if you own a
rug, you own too much. I don’t necessarily like Kerouac and driving
cross country isn’t exactly my idea of a good time, but the guy’s got a
point…</p>
<p><strong>int.- jake’s apartment- later</strong>: Jake enters a
sparsely furnished loft. The skyline of Brooklyn twinkles through dirty,
picturesque windows. Jake drops his keys on a table and hits a button on
an answering machine.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: You have no new messages.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If you’ve got nothing, you’ve got nothing to
lose. And when it comes to money, finding it and losing it, you always
gotta remember how much of it’s just luck…</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The realization makes Jake smile. Then a
FLAPPING SOUND spins him around to see a PIGEON, flapping up against the
inside of a partially opened window. Visibly upset by the bird, Jake
moves towards the window and pushes it wide, allowing the bird to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Dumb fucking luck.</p>
<p><strong>int.- dolby’s apartment- night</strong>: A nicer apartment
than Jake’s. Lionel Dolby, the Mark from the Euclid rushes around,
haphazardly throwing things into a suitcase. There’s a KNOCK on the door
that stops Lionel dead in his tracks. Another KNOCK. Lionel still
frozen. The door flies open with a BOOM. In the doorway, we see HARLIN,
an older mountain of a man dressed in a plain black suit. Behind him is
LUPUS , dressed in a sweatsuit a pilot could spot from 20,000ft.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Mr. Dolby. King would like a word with
you.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: R-r-right now?</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Please. We have a car waiting. I apologize
for the door.</p>
<p><strong>int . - jake’s apartment- morning</strong>: A RINGING PHONE…
Jake stirs on the futon oddly placed on the floor in the middle of the
room and picks up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You better get over to Al’s. Now.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Miles hangs up before Jake can
answer.</p>
<p><strong>int.- big al’s- day</strong>: Jake stand’s with Miles in the
sparse living room. Big AI’s body sits reclining on a Lazy Boy chair,
eyes bulging open. An open carton of food rests in his lap. A feast of
take-out Chinese surrounds him. The TV blares an old episode of “The
Little Rascals.” There’s a singed, neat bullet hole in his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He
likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know… He likes to order that
thing. The Rutti-Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Miles…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Sorry. I’m just… Look what they did to him.
Right in the middle of his egg- foo-young.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Big Al used to send money to his Father, some
Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind in a VA hospital in Cleveland. Al was
like that. That’s why Al never played the Inside.</p>
<p><strong>int.- diner- day</strong>: Gordo enters and takes a seat in
the back booth with Jake and Miles.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden
case of drowning last night.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, this is just fucking great…</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a
good rope. X mean, cash…. That much and we never had to put him on the
“Send?” Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King
Pin.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: The cash we fleeced off of him was collection
money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King
earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. `Cept this time, he
figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still
get the King’s money back before any body says “boo.”</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’s a King Pin?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Currently, the King Pin is a very large- type
pole stuck up our asses.</p>
<p><strong>mtles</strong>: Mob?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Independant. Same shit, just independant.
They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic
book… Big. Fat. Bald.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So what? We hide, right?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: What are you? New? Let me tell you how good
this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently
he’s been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he’s
got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: GORDO</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’re pissed we didn’t get credit?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: No, that was the only semi-fucking smart
thing he said! Except anybody that’s ever met Big A1 knows that the only
thing he’s comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy,
that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it’s way back to
someone who works for the King and–</p>
<p><strong>int- big al’s apartment- night</strong>: Big Al sits on the
Lazy Boy, about to take a big bite of egg foo young. He stops as the
front door is kicked open with a CRASH.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Shazaam.</p>
<p><strong>back to the diner</strong>: GORDO</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We sure Big Al threw him to us?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A bird flew into my house last night.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: JAKE</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Just an idea, but let’s just fucking split.
We’ll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He’ll find us. We go talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Whoa. What?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We’re going to give him the money back?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know what we’re doing with the money.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: And what about Big Al?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Leave him. Someone’s going to find him
eventually. Then they’ll start looking for us, too.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What can I get you guys?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Coffee. And a valium.</p>
<p><strong>ext. - the euclid– day</strong>: A basement bar in a crummy
neighborhood. There’s no sign, but everything about it says,
“Condemned.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The Euclid was our place.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- day</strong>: Jake, Miles and Gordo sit at
the bar of the run down watering hole. Jake stands placing neat stacks
of money into a Fed-Ex box.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot in a
card game. We used it every now and then for a rag, but mostly it was
our office. Our Power Point.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>miles/gordo</strong>: Bills…/Had that thing… Do we want
insurance? I’m just asking…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just mail it to the hospital. Mr. King,
please. It’s regarding an accounting problem. Yes… Correct… I know where
it is. That will be fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tonight. Just me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Fuck that. We’re going too.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Alright, let’s all put our dicks back in our
pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Meet me at my place later.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: How do you know the King’s going to let you
walk?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m getting a ride.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- the bulldog gym- night</strong>: A neon sign in the
shape of a boxing glove tells you what kind of gym it is. A police car
comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and Sobozinski in the front seats.
Jake gets out of the back.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: The King, huh? Nice going.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I try.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Don’t dick around too long. And if he
stabs you or shoots you or causes any other form of profuse bleeding,
call a cab because you are not getting back in this car!</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: We appreciate your punctuality. Mr. King is
expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: Lupus!</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: What? You said pat him down, I’m pattin’ him
down.</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: It only takes a moment to be polite. My
apologies, Mr. Vig. If you wouldn’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You the one that did it? You the one that got
Al?</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: Mr. King prefers to farm out for that kind
of work. Please, after you.</p>
<p><strong>int.- bulldog gym- continuous</strong>: Harlin and Lupus lead
Jake through the cavernous gym. All around them, huge, sweaty, boxers
work the speed bag, jump rope, spar, etc… There’s not one that doesn’t
look like he’s spent some time in the State Penal Boxing League.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh… Which one’s the King Pin?</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: He’s in the back taking a steam.</p>
<p><strong>int.- steam bath- continuous</strong>: A huge room filled
with steam. Harlin and Lupus stand by the door as Jake cautiously steps
in. NEW AGE MUSIC is being played– Could be Yanni. Sitting in a lounge
chair, wearing a white terry cloth robe is THE KING PIN. His large body
is less fat than just big, constructed of circles and topped off with
the baldest head you’ve ever seen. A MANICURIST sits next to the King
Pin working on his nails.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Ow! Watch the pinkie! Every time, you get
the pinkie and I get a hang nail. You Jake?</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Grifter huh? Where have you been on the
grift? Couldn’t been here long ’cause I would have heard of you,
Skippy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and
there.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Here and there, Scooter? Here and there
like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, `til
it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami?
Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You
guy’s pretty good?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have a good crew.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Minus one.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Minus one.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: You know, back in the day, grafting was
considered a gentleman’s racket. Good suits, good food… The Underworld
of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts…
I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they
are, guys like me gotta stay low.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: KING PIN</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I guess it lacks a certain style.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Of course, your line of work’s only as
good as the people you find.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You can’t cheat an honest man.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: You can’t cheat an honest man. But a man
like Lionel Dolby…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Honest mistake. Just give me the money
back and all will be forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let me rephrase– I won`t do that.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Let me repeat– Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Because you killed one of my crew.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Buddy, that was business. Besides, you
have more crew. Then there’s you…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll get the money back, plus interest. I go
on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Fucking grifters! I love it! You got
balls, I’ll give you that much.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. Just confidence.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: I’ ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter
comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler
than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First
thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain
playing me? You tried it once.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We got caught. So you know it won’t happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: I know it won’t happen because you’re
going to feel like a Prom Queen who just got gang fucked by the
wrestling team!</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: Mr. Vig arrived with an escort. NYPD.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Grifters… Always working an angle.
Alright. I can see you got some vision. But I give you the Mark. I tell
you the who and you give me the how. Lupus go with him.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Consider him part of your crew. Consider
him a part of me.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: He goes. Now let me see your hands.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The King picks up the nail file
again.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: You ask a lot of questions. Come on. Let
me see `em. I don’t like to ask things more than once, Junior. I want
you to know how much that irks me.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: You have incredibly soft hands. Good
cuticles . They’ re like a baby’s hands. Grifters with rough hands… You
know that they’re probably not that good. Means they’ve had to do some
hard labor to make ends meet. But you… Smooth… Supple.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Are you insinuating that the King Pin is of
an alternative lifestyle?</p>
<p><strong>ext. back alley- night</strong>: Jake shakes his head
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m not saying anything. Besides, you’re one
to talk. You’re the one who’s got me on my knees in a dark alley.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: And these cops? What do they get?</p>
<p><strong>int. - squad car- night</strong>: Rottovich and Sobozinski
sit staked out in front of a small cigar/magazine store.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just a tip.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: What are we gonna do with this stuff
anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: You sell it.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Don’t be an idiot. How hard do you think
it is to sell one drug dealer’s drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig’s
right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty
grand…</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: You think this is a good idea? We never
did this kinda shit before.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: What’s he going to do? File a missing
drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more
turns.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist
bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches
up. One fifty! It’s not even covered.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: It’s cosmetic. They don’t cover
cosmetic.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ROTTOVICH</p>
<p><strong>int.- another car- same</strong>: Parked across the street
and well hidden among the other parked cars… SPECIAL AGENT GUNTHER
MOONAN, a guy in his early 40’s in the kind of suit you’d find on a
“2–for-1” rack. He sits pointing a TELESCOPE MICROPHONE out the window,
wearing headphones. He chews on gum loudly.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Bullshit it’s cosmetic! My fucking tooth
was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity.
The department’s dental is for shit.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: Whoa, whoa… There he is.</p>
<p><strong>shut.</strong>: Moonan puts down the mic and hits “STOP” on a
microcassette recorder.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Confessions of a poor brusher.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- street/brooklyn- same</strong>: Rottovich and
Sobozinski walk quickly down the street. Ahead of them, the hooded
figure approaches, his hands buried in his pockets, a knapsack slung
over his shoulder. As he gets closer, we see that he’s just a KID of
about ten or eleven. Rottovich reaches over and pulls off the Kid’s
hood.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: You know who we are?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: The heat.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rottovich can’t help smiling.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: That’s right. We’re the heat.</p>
<p><strong>stick `em up!</strong>: The Kid jumps back startled and
throws his hands up. The cops share a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Alright. Put your hands dawn. What do you
got in the bag?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Something for my Pops.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: I see. Well, your Pops has been making
you carry around drugs for him. We’re going to have to take them.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: My Pops is going to be mad.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Give the kid a twenty.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: What’s the world coming to? Everybody’s
on the friggin’ take…</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back-night</strong>: Butch and Jake…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Keeping the Fix happy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You never know when you can use a crooked
cop.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel
Dolby.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So you want to know how to play the Big
Con.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: In this case, you might say I want to know
how not to play the Big Con.</p>
<p><strong>int.- bar- night</strong>: A trendy bar, dimly lit and
packed. We PAN along the hip crowd and STOP on Jake speaking with a
SLICK GUY dressed in black Armani.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: First thing about being on the grift…. You’re
only as good as your Mark. The Roper’s the guy who finds them.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They all have money one way or another. Some
of them come from money.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s that saying– Show me an honest man and
I’ll show you a natural born liar. There’s always that little bit of bad
no matter how much good. It’s that little itch on the back of you neck.
You may not even know it’s there, but it is.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A good Roper knows how to scratch it– You the
outdoorsy-type? “I was just fly fishing out in Montana”. You play the
market? “I just got a tip on a tech start-up IPO.” You saw “the
’Riverdance” twice? “I had a roommate in college who was gay.”
Whatever…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It means that in fifteen minutes we’re on good
terms. Thirty, I’m your buddy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: In an hour, I’m your best friend.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Give me a day and you’ll let me do your wife
and daughter at the same time. It’s too late for you…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have your confidence.</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: Dolby’s lips loosen in a wide SMILE. Jake
smiles back. He puts his drink down, then takes the drink from Dolby.
They remain talking as THE BACKGROUND–</p>
<p><strong>ext. - sidewalk-night</strong>: Under the light of a
streetlamp, the two continue to talk.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I tell you the “Tale”– It’s the story of how
we’re going to make easy money. No one gets hurt. And here’s the guy
who’s going to help. That’s when you meet the Insideman.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and
looking slightly anxious. Introductions are made.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The Insideman’s the one with the know- How,
the scoop, the angle. But maybe ‘you’ re the suspicious type . So I give
you the “Convincer.” We both put up a little and we get a little back.
Just a taste.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just enough that when I tell you we can make
more off of it, you agree.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That`s when I put you on the “Send.” You put
in -a little, you got a little. Put in a lot… I “send” you out for mare.
As much as you can get.</p>
<p><strong>int. - jake’s apartment- night</strong>: Jake stands TALKING
DIRECTLY TO CAMERA, loading a big, black revolver with bullets.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Doesn’t matter what the con is. Insider
trading, a line we got on a bookie club, insurance scam, whatever… You
saw the money and you want it. More of it. Who cares if you have to bend
the rules a little? As long as no one gets hurt. Then someone does…</p>
<p><strong>int. - the euglid bar- night</strong>: A flash of Gordo’s
stunned face before his chest EXPLODES</p>
<p><strong>in red.</strong>: Jake stands holding the smoking gun. Dolby
looks around in shock.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Frankie Suits always said, that what you have
to understand about any confidence game, is that it’s like putting on a
play where everyone knows their part… The Roper, the Insideman, the
Shills… Everyone except for the Mark.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: I’ve been shot. Oh. The humanity.</p>
<p><strong>big al</strong>: God. No. Please. Don’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You better hurry. The police will be here any
second. I don’t really understand my motivation with this. Why am I
washing glasses?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now you’re an accomplice in a homicide.
Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window
or is dripping down your leg.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You should be running out the door, desperate
to forget this ever happened, ready to repent your greedy ways!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dolby eyes the briefcases of money.</p>
<p><strong>dolby</strong>: What about… The money?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then there it is again… That little itch.
There’s a guy holding a smoking gun, a guy bleeding all over the floor
and still, all you can think about is the money. You twisted fuck. So we
gotta give you the “Blow-off”. We make sure that you never, ever want to
look for us again. We get you off our backs. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And that’s why you need the “Fix”…</p>
<p><strong>ext.- sidewalk- continuous</strong>: Dolby tries to act
casual as he walks away.</p>
<p><strong>int. - the euclid bar- continuous</strong>: Rottovich and
Sabozinski enter the front door.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The New York Police Department’s finest. Half
as smart and twice as crooked as the guy they just chased away.</p>
<p><strong>ext - back alley- night</strong>: Butch eases the gun off
Jake’s head.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So how’d you get caught?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or
later someone’s going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it
takes a little longer.</p>
<p><strong>int.- jake’s aparpment–night</strong>: Empty except for
Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lupus, dressed in another of his trademark loud
sweatsuits.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’re working for the King.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Wait a second… Who’s the mope?</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: I’m the King’s eyes and ears. Just in case
you decide to get cute.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: So we gotta short con our way out of a
hundred and fifty grand? That could only take like, a year.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out
from under all this. But we need another Shill.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What do we need another Shill for?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Breasts.</p>
<p><strong>int . - wax–night</strong>: A crowded night… LILY, the
attractive blonde from earlier, flirts with a well dressed, OLDER MAN
who has his hand firmly planted on her ass. She squeezes his hand and
gives him a quick peck on the cheek before walking away. She takes a
look at the man’s wallet she just lifted before putting it in her bag.
From out of nowhere, Jake bumps into her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- alley/outside bar- night</strong>: Jake pushes Lily
through the back door where she finds Gordo, Miles and Lupus waiting.
Her once flirtatious demeanor is replaced by something harder.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What is this? You guys cops or something?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’re not cops.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: You gotta be kidding me. Her?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes, her. Where’s my wallet?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Your what? That’s not–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You interested in a little work?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I’m
going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a waxed out Visa and a bad
fake I.D., you’re fucking crazy. Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Take a deep breath and count to ten. It’s not
that kind of work. You’re Lily, right?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re working Daffy’s block. He was going to
break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told
him you were with us, so that’s two you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure
on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up,
Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going? Keep the
wallet. We’re even. Take a deep breath… Count to ten… And go fuck
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Is it just me or is there something really
hot about a girl telling you to go fuck yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ext.- city sidewalk- night</strong>: Lily down the street,
Jake giving chase.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the
job.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Gee thanks. Now I don’t have to find that
bridge to jump off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We had to see what your deal was. I’m just a
little superstitious.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Here’s my deal– Don’t waste my time. What do
you want me for anyway? You don’t even know me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I just have a good feeling about you. Haven’t
you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No. What’s my cut?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You get an equal cut.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What do I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just play a part. A little acting.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Make a wish.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Eleven-eleven. If you’re superstitious, make a
wish.</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley- night</strong>: Butch smiles…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I can see why you liked her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed
the Mark.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- day</strong>: Jake stands in front of the
crew: Miles, Gordo, Lily and Lupus.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Morgan Gillette.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Because that’s who the King Fin wants us to
fleece. And Gillette’s perfect…</p>
<p><strong>int.- city bank of manhattan/boardroom–day</strong>: A circle
of BUSINESS MEN sitting at a conference table.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: His grandfather used to run liquor during
prohibition and his father made a bundle in illegal importing and
exporting. That makes him a third generation crook.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: JAKE</p>
<p><strong>int. - city bank of manhattan/hallway-day</strong>: Gillette
is greeted by a handful of SUITS. Butch is with them, staying in the
periphery.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s a story going around that he helped
fund the Contras back in the eighties.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- city bank of manhattan- day</strong>: A busy mid-day
New York sidewalk. Gillette heads towards a waiting Town Car.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Most of his money’s clean. A lot of it isn’t.
The best part is that we know exactly where it is.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid– resuming</strong>: Jake looks over the
crew, who are less than convinced.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: How much we going after?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Two million.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the
King.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: That’s worth it right there. You ask me, I
don’t think you can do it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m with Jack LaLane. That guy’s
untouchable.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s why we don’t go after him directly.</p>
<p><strong>int.- city bank of manhattan/lobby</strong>: Empty. The
marble floor spotless, the dark oak teller windows vacant, a row of
desks.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We find a doable guy in Gillette’s bank…
Someone about mid-level. Not too high, not too low.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring
about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in
order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the
right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom,
depending upon what we need.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: How’s that? He works for Gillette.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We pay better.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: An envelope stuffed with cash
MATERIALIZES on the desk next to Ashby.</p>
<p><strong>ext . – caymen islands–day</strong>: Crystal clear water
gently rolls onto a white beach.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Our guy gets us approved for the start up
capital. But, the money can’t be transferred to any one person. On the
given day, the money’s wired into a corporate account in an off-shore
bank.</p>
<p><strong>int.- grand caymen’s bank- day</strong>: Another empty bank…
A lone TELLER MATERIALIZES behind the counter.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That same day, I show up in the Caymens with
the proper I.D. and corporate papers to make a withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>mile5</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mile5</strong>: I’m just thinking out loud here, but… Two
million in a briefcase?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s bank policy not to release this money in
cash because it’s under a corporate account.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Teller turns to a computer printer
and removes a check. Jake signs a few documents and places the check
into his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- caymen islands/street–day</strong>: Lined with shops
and stores, but it’s as empty as the bank. Not even a car: Jake strides
out of the Grand Caymen’s Bank and walks across the street to another
building with a sign reading “BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS.”</p>
<p><strong>int.- bank of the grand caymens- day</strong>: Again, empty…
Jake strides in and approaches the deserted teller counter. ANOTHER
TELLER MATERIALIZES and greets him with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So we cash the check at another bank. Jake
slides the suitcase and the check over to the Teller.</p>
<p><strong>int.- jfk airport/terminal hallway- day</strong>: Like the
banks, empty. Jake walks with the suitcase down the flourescent lit hall
towards a series of tables under a sign marked “Customs.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now, this is the most important part– You
can’t just walk into the United States with a suitcase full of cash
without evoking the words “cavity search”.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s why you need someone on the inside at
Customs.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Officer literally looks the other
way as he pockets the envelope and waves Jake through the gate.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- jfk airport- day</strong>: Jake exits the terminal.
Outside, the street is empty, not a traveler, an airlines rep, a luggage
handler or a cab. Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the “walk”
signal is given.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then we disappear.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- resuming</strong>: Jake stops and gauges
the crew for their reactions, which are the same all the way around–
Slack jawed disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: This might just be me, but that is hands
down, the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: People have tried this before, Jake. It’s
never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for
it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It never worked before because A, they didn’t
flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they
didn’t have someone on the inside with Customs.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, or D, it’s a dumb fucking idea…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We never had a problem with that before.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem
before.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What are you talking about? Yes we have. And
we would have been beautiful about it. We would’ve had a bucket of
chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to
it. Then we woulda moved on `til the next local putz caught on.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’re getting a little old for running.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Yeah, well we’re still a little young for
Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I’m pissed too, but I’ m
not like “twenty-five to life” pissed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m getting clear of this. If you’re not going
to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Yeah… Whatever, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, not “whatever.” You’re either in or you’
re out.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- pay phone- day</strong>: Jake dials a number…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I agreed with Miles. It was, hands down, a
dumb fucking idea.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But they bought it. Now I had to deliver and I
needed help. Yeah, it’s Jake. How’d that tip work out?</p>
<p><strong>ext. back alley- night</strong>: Butch takes out a
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: But there were other factors.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Factors that weren’t clear to me until
now.</p>
<p><strong>int. - 16th precint/office- day</strong>: An office of empty
chairs and desks. Through the windows we can see the hustle and bustle
of the precinct. SPECIAL AGENT GUNTHER MOONAN, still dressed in the same
shitty suit, sits behind a desk as Rottovich and Sobozinski enter.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Gentlemen? Special Agent Gunther Moonan.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Special Agent?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this
would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I’m looking for Jake Vig.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: I’ve been looking for this Jake Vig for some
time now. Problem is, the guy’s the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a
ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake’s good buddy and member of his crew,
Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Moonan holds up crime scene photos of
Big Al’s body.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Look Special Agent Moonan… We don’t know
what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Don’t be an idiot. How hard do you think
it is to sell one drug dealer’s drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig’s
right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty
grand.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The two serious
looking gentlemen outside? Internal Affairs.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Do you want to know the first time I had a
line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card. Belated, but it’s the thought,
right? Oh, this prick’s got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys
probably know him better than I do. In fact, I’ve only met the guy once.
But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His
“Fix.”</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: You help me catch him. Whatever he’s into
next, I want you to be into. And what you’re into, I’m into. If it all
goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape.
I’ll clear you guys of anything you’ve ever done with Vig under the
guise of some cross-departmental investigation. This prick’s been on the
wish list for so long, you’ll probably get gold shields out of it.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: What do you get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Not everyone’s on the take, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: If you Feds are so hot for him, why don’t
we just bring him in right now?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: I want him for something big and to do that,
we have to catch him in the act.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: This guy must have been a real pain in
your dick.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Literally. It’s not a bad deal, gentleman. I
get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part,
Walter… Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that
winning smile. Capice?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Good. One more thing… You gotta give up the
booty. I can’t have you guys running around with heroin.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let me tell you something about Moonan…</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley- night</strong>: A serious look comes
across Jake’s face– Hate. Butch eases back with the gun for a
second.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He’s just as crooked as the next guy. You’d
think he’d have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Cue the fucking violins. Come on… It’s
getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>int. - the kiev diner- day</strong>: Gordo, Miles, Jake and
Lily next to him, all crammed into a booth.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Am I the only one who feels like we can’t
make a move with this guy on us?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: We should ditch him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just watch every thing you say around him.
Every word, every move… It all goes back to the King Pin.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: How’s the hoop, superstar? Clean?</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: What is it with you and bathrooms?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: He doesn’t like using a bathroom unless he
knows it’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Manly.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: You laugh now, but wait until you need a
clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation
does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can
get off a toilet or doorknob? Let’s do the list… Hepatitis, influenza,
the flesh eating disease-</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Here’s what’s going to happen. Gordo, we need
to find a guy in Gillette’s bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate,
insurance…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Is it all fugasi?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But
you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a
Banker.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What about Customs?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll worry about Customs.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Hey, I’ m not just along for the ride, so I
don’t want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Take a deep breath. You sound like you just
broke up with your boyfriend or something.</p>
<p><strong>int.- bulldog gym- day</strong>: Boxers at the bags, a
jumping rope, etc… Jake and Lily stand in front of the King Pin, who’s

Lupus and Harlin stand vigil by the sparring ring.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I think two million.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: What do you need from me? Permission? Go!
If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I need you to stake me.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Stake you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I need you to stake me. I can’t do it without
it. It’s just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we’re
done.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: That’s more than you already owe me. What
happens if you fuck this up?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Hey Skippy? Do I have the word “chump”
tattooed on my forehead?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Mr . King, I think—</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You
just might learn something here.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Listen, Scooter—</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, you listen. We’re partners now and even
though I’m running the show for you, I’m still running the show. That
means I get a little respect. So I don’t want to hear anymore of this
Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It’s Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all
his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Take off your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: I said take off your fucking shirt.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Fine. You want me to take it off, I’ll take it
off.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Look at you, you skinny prick.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re not going to bust out baby oil and
start rubbing me down or anything, are you?</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Come here. Feel this.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No thanks. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Come here!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You guys are freaking me out.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Shut up. Feel that? That’s solid muscle.
Not an ounce of fat. Go ahead. Punch it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I am not going–</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Come on. Harder.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I think I just broke my hand.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy. All
muscle.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Maybe it’s true. Maybe you can’t cheat an
honest man. Me? I’m about as dishonest as they come and that’s the
truth. But if you even think about trying to con me they’ll find fucking
pieces of you in each of the five boroughs. Pieces of you, pieces of
her, pieces of your whole crew. Can’t be any mare honest than that. I’ll
stake you, but that’s three hundred fifty you’re in the hole and
consider the juice running. Now go make me proud.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You get all that?</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley</strong>: Butch lets out an easy laugh.</p>

who’s weakness you can exploit.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Guy like me, with people like that… I’ll tell

safety of tedious and solitary lifestyle. Moral and ethical constitution
flexible.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What you’re looking for in a mark is someone
who’s got nothing to lose. No friends, no family, no life. You’re
looking for a guy who doesn’t own a rug.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ m sure.</p>
<p><strong>int.- garment district/warehouse- day</strong>: Jake, Miles,
Gordo, Lily and Lupus enter a warehouse housing racks of clothes.</p>

He. Was on the grift since he was ten.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Last of the red hot grifters.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Back in the day, Suits made money running
fight stores and the wire with a Fix so tight it was like a legit
business. I never understood what the point was if grifting became like
a regular job.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We need wardrobe. So I see. In from Long
Island? You fellas take a look around.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Hey Suits? You got anything in like a eleven

financial records. There’s also the I.D. you asked for. Corporate papers

<p><strong>suits</strong>: In over your head?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Pretty much. Suits eyes Lily.</p>
<p><strong>suits</strong>: Can I speak to you in confidence?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Huh? Oh. She’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>suits</strong>: Try and keep up… You ask for the Advantage
Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think
you’re either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A little bit of both.</p>
<p><strong>suits</strong>: Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got
no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.</p>

that place in the hall of fame?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s not history.</p>
<p><strong>suits</strong>: So what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I want to get out from under all this for
good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.</p>
<p><strong>suits</strong>: Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can’t
get what you want.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes I can.</p>
<p><strong>suits</strong>: Still time.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Can’t do it Suits. I can’t lay down for this
one.</p>
<p><strong>suits</strong>: Okay. Here’s the thing… You fall flat, you
might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it’s Blue River Land for
everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to
multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it’s the shape of an
arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We

<p><strong>lily</strong>: It’s just that I left my asshole decoder ring

<p><strong>lily</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And some new clothes.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’re going to rope this banker tomorrow and
you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this
thing and I don’t even know if you can.</p>

<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t trust anyone.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Then show me how.</p>
<p><strong>int. - tiffany’s - night</strong>: Jake and Lily enter the
store. Jake takes a quick moment to case the place– A few scattered
CUSTOMERS, some being helped by SALESPEOPLE. All the Customers look like
the uppercrust crowd you’d expect at Tiffany’s.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh yeah. This is good. This will do nicely.
This is about confidence. Your confidence and their confidence. You get
their confidence by giving them yours.</p>

<p><strong>jake</strong>: It is you. Hello!</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Sorry, I–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with
your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of
all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Excuse me? I believe you’re holding something
far me under Pearson.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: Do you have a ticket?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know, this is kind of embarassing, but my
wallet was stolen yesterday and I’m afraid the ticket was in it. But the
name’s Pearson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: While you’re back there, could you make
sure that Carolyn is spelled with a “y”? What brings you down from
Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: My wife and I are just taking a little
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewts</strong>: Carolyn’s down this weekend too.</p>

<p><strong>jake</strong>: Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis’s
father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry, honey. I’m almost done.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll be looking for earrings.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Attractive girl.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thank you. Actually, it’s our first
anniversary this weekend. She thinks I’m here to pick up something for
my mother, but it’s actually a gift for her. Think I’ve fooled her?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Take it from me, you never do. But
congratulations. Nice to be married, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Very much so.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: We have Carolyn with a “y”. I’m sorry,
there’s nothing under Pearson. If we had an invoice number–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I told you. My wallet was stolen. Please…
Check again.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Good luck. Congratulations again.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn’t
too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the
weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It’s a check. We
split the cost on a few books and I haven’t had the chance to pay her
back yet. Could you..?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’d be a great help.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Salesgirl returns.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: I’m sorry. Nothing under Pearson.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re sure? This is… Just a complete
disaster.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A ring for my wife. Alot like that one. In
fact, it was that one.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: That’s no problem. We have those in
stock.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thank you. Sorry, I’m just a little anxious to
give it to her. You take out of state checks?</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: With identification.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen
last night. Is there any way..?</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know it’s policy, but… The thing is… It’s
our first anniversary and we’re only in town for the weekend. It’s a
very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her
and I think she’s going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers
to call for people who’ll vouch. I can send you I.D. later…</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This is embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. Thank you very much for doing
this. And please tell Carolyn hello for me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. lewis</strong>: Why don’t you let me put the ring on the
card and you can write me a check in return?</p>
<p><strong>ext.- tiffany’s/sidewalk–night</strong>: Jake and Lily exit
the store. Jake hands Lily the trademark colored box.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Happy anniversary.</p>

your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now we gotta give him a strong finish.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake pulls Lily closer and looks into
her eyes. She leans in and they kiss– A deep, slow kiss that makes
people have to walk around them. Mr. Lewis sees them and smiles to
himself as he gets into a cab. Jake and Lily are still kissing as the
cab pulls away. Lily finally breaks the kiss— Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: He’s gone.</p>

<p><strong>moonan</strong>: It’s Moonan… I’m in New York. Listen, I got
Vig. He’s here and I’m this close… Look, I understand that, but I’m
telling you this time… Obsessive is a big word to use… Goddamn it, Lou!
I’m telling you, this is it. Yeah… I figured you’d feel that way. So
here’s the deal… Call Kylie over at the Bureau. Tell him I got something
that might interest him. A guy they call the King Pin. I think there may
be a corruption case brewing here, too… That’s right. So even if I don’t
get Vig, you’ll still have something to show.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MOONAN</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: Whaddya mean? We got dick.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: You guy’s are not working with me here. I
just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new
Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I’m
welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY
FUCKING TIME!</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Like we told you before, we think he’s
into something with the King Pin—</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Look, I’m not a confrontational person by
nature.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: I need answers and the only two things
you’ve given me are jack and shit. You gotta do better. You gotta do
better or I swear on my sweet dead grandmother’s grave, I’m gonna make
you guys an I-A-fucking-D cautionary tale.</p>

<p><strong>butch</strong>: You’re a superstitious fucker.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Luck’s a funny thing. Especially the bad.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Having a gun pointed at you for one. It’s not

cats… Believe it. Believe it all.</p>
<p><strong>int.- jake’s apartment- night</strong>: Miles, Jake, Lupus

<p><strong>int.- jake’s apartment- night</strong>: It’s the scene
earlier, when Jake finds a BIRD rapping at his window to get out.</p>

eyes stare straight at us, his mouth hanging open.</p>

<p><strong>back to freeze frame on lily’s bird blouse.</strong>: The
action resumes…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You have no idea what you’ve done do you? No

this means? You’ve killed us. We’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Did I miss something?</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: The red hair… It’s bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: It’s not like she’s a real redhead, Jake…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Like that matters! You can’t fool bad luck!
You can’t get by on a technicality! You can’t trick karma!</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So much for that good feeling, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Anybody says a word I swear to God…</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley- night</strong>: Butch cracks a big
smile.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: She had you tempting fate.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: My father used to play the same fucking lotto
numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday
for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he’s out and
plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two
million.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Guess he passed on that unlucky- asshole
gene.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You should have trusted me Jake.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the bull and the bear pub- night</strong>: Jake turns
and looks at the crew, Miles, Gordo, Lupus and Lily behind him. Grant
Ashby sits alone at the crowded bar, doing his crossword puzzle. Jake a
smile and saunters over to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: She up for this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She’s up for it.</p>
<p><strong>angle on ashby at the bar</strong>: Ashby sits finishing a
drink. Snippets of CONVERSATION and LAUGHTER from the cliques around him
catch his attention, but he remains alone.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Is this seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Uh, no. Please.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: But I’m not that late. You didn’t have to give
away my seat.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: I wasn’t sure if you’d make it.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Oh, I didn’t know you… Here. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit
for a while.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Tough day?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Brutal day. They say the streets are lined
with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake.
What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Uh, Maker’s Mark. Rocks.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: My name’s Grant. Grant Ashby.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Oh god. I’m overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily
Finn.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: So, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: It’s more like what aren’t I doing. My
partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech
company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then
again who hasn’t up there.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Silicon Valley?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: That’s right. So, brainiacs that we are, we
thought we’d be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a
straight corporate loan out here.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: I can—</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: On me. For the seat. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So we’ve been meeting with banks all day. It’s
amazing how many ways they can say “no” without ever using the word.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Well, typically, corporate loans are
relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for
gross fund recovery.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Don’t tell me you started a tech firm here
before us.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a
bank.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: My partners are here.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You’re welcome. I was just going to ask you if
you’d like to join us. Ashby brightens again.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the bull and the bear pub/table- later</strong>: Ashby
sits with the crew, a few empty glasses in front of him. He looks
remarkably relaxed, just another guy hanging around with a group of
friends.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She got one leg out from under him. Now we had
to lean.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: So then Miles walks straight into the
Creative Director’s office and says “The code’s fine, the program’s for
shit” and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy’s
desk!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So this is our boss, right? He chases me and
Miles out of his office and he’s yelling and screaming, “You’re fired!
Your whole team’s fired!” He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo–</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: But the best part was that he couldn’t find
Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a
stall door and starts yelling! And there’s Gordo, pants at the ankles,
holding a PC World Magazine!</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: I haven’t been able to use a public bathroom
since.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Especially with the thing!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh, right… And that was it. That’s when we
decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.</p>
<p><strong>ashsy</strong>: I envy you guys. Taking a chance like
that.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Masters of our own destiny.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So far, masters of our own demise. What bank
are you with?</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: City Bank of Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: That’s that Gillette guy, right? You Like
him? As a boss, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: He’s . . . He’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you do over at your bank, Grant?</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: What do I do? I’m the VP of Finance.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Wow. We haven’t met with anyone your level
yet. VP? So that means there’s you, then the P.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Here’s where a little research comes in handy.
Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It’s a small lie, but
now we’re sure he’s playing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe you can help us understand what’s so
hard about getting a corporate loan.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Well, typically speaking, they’re not. As
long as you can demonstrate–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we
got that part.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: That’s right. And tech firms… They ’tend to
scare people off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They scare people off because most people lack
vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Banks need to know how they’re going to get
their money back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We know exactly how we’re going to make The
money back. There in lies the Catch-22</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Jake…</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: It’s alright. Grant’s one of the good
guys.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Yeah. He’s our boy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Listen, what I’m about to tell you, I’m
telling you in confidence, okay? Have you ever heard of a company called
Big.Com?</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Big.Com. That Internet thing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Right. The guys who started that did what a
lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around,
raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft,
Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they’ve pretty much sold
the company before they’re even real. The bigger company is already set
to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually
works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for
like five times the initial loan.</p>
<p><strong>ashy</strong>: Sort of like a letter of intent.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can’t
tell anyone about the offer, because if it’s public, you could start a
bidding war and that’s considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a
deal. But, wait too long and you’re not considered hot anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: And you have this letter of intent?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes. That’s why I wish there were guys willing
to take a chance and live a little.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: We’re getting down to the wire. Apparently
another company has a similar product in R&amp;D right now. If they beat
us to it…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Off the record, I’m this close to cutting
someone in on the action if it’d help.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Should we get another round?</p>
<p><strong>tnt.- city street- night</strong>: Jake, Lupus, Miles, Gordo
and Lily walking, still on a celebratory high.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus,
I almost felt sorry for the guy.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I
got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I’ m going home</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Let’s go, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh… No thanks. I’m not going all the way to
Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Lupus! When this is all over, you’re going to
tell me who the King put on Al.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: You going to have the time?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’11 find the time.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Look at you… You want to go.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: For what? A couple hundred bucks?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I think you’d do it for free. You’ re almost
drooling. You like the rush.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s what I do. It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Why? Your mother not breast feed you or
something?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are you asking me if I have something to
prove?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Do you have something to prove?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not in that repressed anger sort of way.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I’m your basic underachiever. Can’t stand
working and porn doesn’t seem like a good option.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good quality porn has it’s place in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Whatever. But you… I get the feeling you could
have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m good at it. Lying, cheating. Manipulating…
I’m good at it.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: It’s more than that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Intuition. It doesn’t make you Yoda. Like
tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So that was my part? Smile and shake my
ass?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. You have another part? You’ll know what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: How do you know I will?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Intuition.</p>
<p><strong>int.- lily’s apartment- night</strong>: Illuminated only by
the light coming from the windows… Jake runs a hand down the length of
Lily’s bare back. She falls onto him, both of them hitting the bed
locked in a deep kiss. Lily’s hand moves down Jake’s arm until it finds
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You have really soft hands. Like a baby’s.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t ruin this for me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley night</strong>: Jake takes a deep breath,
Butch and Lily behind him.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know when the first con was ever played?
It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then she fucked him over with an apple.
Redheads…</p>
<p><strong>int . - lily’s apartment–day</strong>: Not even the soft
morning light can diffuse the reality of this slum-pit studio apartment.
Jake lies next to Lily, kissing her neck. A spoon RATTLES in a glass
from the growing RUMBLE of a passing subway train. The RUMBLE rises to
an almost deafening volume. Jake’s a little alarmed. Lily,
oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How do you deal with—</p>
<p><strong>said, how do–</strong>: Deal with that?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Do you think we can do it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe. Even if we don’t, you’ll be alright.
You’re not in the hole with the King.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Who says you have to know the King to be in a
whole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I
worked as a candy striper.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sounds respectable.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the
time. I don’t know how you could change bedpans sober.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He
was an x-ray technician or something.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You want to talk about an old boyfriend right
now?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: He wasn’t my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at
the time… What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only
fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to
get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey
or some stupid shit like that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for
me.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: We were friends. I trusted him. I should have
known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You guys got busted. This is a great neck.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No, we never got busted. We were done with a
shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn
about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know?
I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him. What
the hell was his name?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Glenn talked you out of it.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Sort of. I was telling him about this great
love of my life who’s name I don’t remember, and I could see… He was
getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me,
but…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LILY</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He was looking out for you.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the
floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started
ripping my uniform off. He said he was going to “fuck some sense into
me.”</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Shit, what was that guy’s name? I really liked
him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Lily… Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple
of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met
him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into
his chest. Three or four times.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Did, uh… Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I don’t know. I packed up my shit and ran
away. To this… So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a
repressed anger sort of way.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. You trusted him… You were just getting
square.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You know why I told you that, Jake? Because I
trust you too.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake tries a reassuring smile even
though he’s not sure it’s something he should be smiling about. The
spoon starts to RATTLE again as another subway train RUMBLES in the
distance.</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley-night</strong>: Lily shakes her head in
disbelief that Jake would tell the story.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sorry, honey. But I figure if we can’t all
share at a time like this…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You got some issues, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>int.- ashby’s office- day</strong>: Ashby sits behind a desk
in front of the crew. In front of him are the corporate papers.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We had to finalize the deal.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Everything looks in order.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This has to happen fast.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: I know. It won’t go unnoticed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’ll be red flags.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You need some convincing. Consider it a
convincer.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Let’s just slow down for a second…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re worried about recouping the loan. I
already told you.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: No, I understand that. What I mean… What I’m
trying to say… I was actually wondering about… Well, my cut.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The standard ten.</p>
<p><strong>ashby</strong>: Ten percent. Of how much?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Two million.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: We’re going to make it back, Grant.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And all you need to do for your ten percent is
put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>int.- city bank of manhattan/hallway- day</strong>: Jake
exits Ashby’s office with Lupus, Gordo, Miles and Lily. They all follow
Jake down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: You’ll be there?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Eight A.M. flight.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Calls?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’ll use the Euc.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- street- day</strong>: Jake, Lily, Miles, Gordo and
Lupus… As they move through the crowded sidewalk, Rottovich and
Sobozinski appear behind them.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Hey Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That tip not work-out for you fellas?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more
curious about the Fed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, listen… If you guys don’t pay your taxes,
that’s your business.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: Back up.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: You want I should hold him down?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Gordo throws Lupus a look.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a
bell?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Gunther? I think I’d remember a Gunther.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Ring it for him, Sobo.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Well he’s in town and he sure as shit
remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can’t afford
to have a Fed onto us.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Wouldn’t dream of it.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: I don’t know what you’re into with the
King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big
piece. If we find out you’re keeping us out, I may suddenly develope a
conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we
got a deal, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: And don’t leave town! I always wanted to
say that…</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: People don’t like you much, do they?</p>
<p><strong>int.- car- day</strong>: Rottovich and Sobozinski get in the
front of a squad car. In the back, Moonan sits reading the Travel
section of the NY Times.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Did he buy it?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: I think so. What’d he ever do to you
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Let’s just say he burned me once.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Why’s this guy so hard up for you? You’re not
exactly a threat to national security.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- day</strong>: Jake sits at a barstool,
battered and bruised. Lily tends to him with a towel. Miles and Gordo
pour drinks. Lupus sits at a table, watching.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We go way back…</p>
<p><strong>ext.- dog racetrack- day</strong>: A BELL… A mechanical
rabbit springs forward. Greyhounds bolt out of the gate.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: About four years ago, we were working in
Miami, turf fixing for some local goon.</p>
<p><strong>int.– racetrack- day</strong>: Gordo, Miles, Big A1 and Jake
watch the race with indifference, surrounded by excited SPECTATORS.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Turns out this local goon was being watched by
the Feds, which means we were being watched by the Feds. One in
particular.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Special Agent Gunther Moonan.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- racetrack/parking lot- day</strong>: Moonan walks over
to a car.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He didn’t really have anything on us, but I
figure, maybe this guy’s good for a Fix. So I ask him out to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>int.- la scala- night</strong>: An elegant restaurant. Jake
sits confidently in an expensive suit speaking to the shabbily dressed
Moonan across from him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: These guys we have now, sure, give them twenty
bucks and they’ll look the other way on a parking ticket. But a Fed… You
get a guy like that as your Fix…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It was probably a stupid idea. There I am,
Armani and Rolex. There he is, JC Penny and Timex…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Moonan smiles and slides the envelope
back over to Jake with a disappointed shake of his head.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So I took a shot. But now he had me on
attempted bribery of a Federal Agent.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s when Gordo comes in with the Hazelnut
French Roast.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- la scala/parking lot- night</strong>: Miles pulls up in
an old Cadillac, picking up Jake at the entrance. They pick up Gordo and
Big Al from a side door and drive off as Moonan limps out of the
restaurant, still holding his crotch.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- day</strong>: Jake finishes the story to
Lupus.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And that’s how Special Agent Gunther Moonan
and I became friends.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Moonan. Here. Shit…</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: So what? We just stay clear of him.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Jesus… Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, I’m not going to take it easy. You can’t
stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What do we do? We change the scam?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There is no scam! I’ve got a fucking sign on
my back! I can’t leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of
money. You get it? It’s over. We walk.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Jake–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do I always tell you guys? Don’t spend it
all. Sooner or later we’re going to run into some bad luck. Save some.
Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you’re not desperate.
That’s it. The gig’s up.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: That’s it? What are you talking about? We can
still do this!</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: Jake, I mean, come on–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for
your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the
Armani! You with the hookers!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Escorts!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what
he looked like sitting there?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You are such a raving pussy sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes
you a good judge of character. And don’t think I didn’t know you were
working some angle with that either.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Everyone’s working an angle, right?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There are three people I trust– him, him and a
guy who got killed. I don’t know who you are! You’re like some stray doq
that wandered into the house. So I’m telling you to cut loose of this.
No one’s looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette.
Just go wherever it is you would go. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What about…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What about what?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: What about the money?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So there it is. You got that big itch you need
to scratch. It’s all about the fucking money. What do you want, an
apology?</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No, I want my cut!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m going to say this one last time for You,
so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>gordo</strong>: So that’s it…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: King ain’t gonna like this.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll settle up with your boss. We
haven’t skipped town yet.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: What I’m saying is, is that the King ain’t
gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If
you ask me I think he’s jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Of what? They’re both crooks.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Exactly. `Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to
walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank,
that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid
to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: My fucking heart bleeds.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn’t
wait to have that guy whacked. He didn’t even know who the guy was, but
he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain’t personal.
It’s business.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Point, Lupus. Give us a point.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Point is, you don’t go through with this,
he’s going to go after you next. And he don’t even like you, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley</strong>: Butch hovering over Jake…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So much for honor among thieves. You would
have cut loose your friends, your girl…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was doing it for them.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You - Lost
your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren’t being noble. You
weren’t trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yes it is Jake! Yes it is! They were right
there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her! She trusted you
and you sold her out! Be honest! Be a man! Tell her, Jake! Tell her that
you loved her but the money meant more to you! Grifters… Gentleman’s
racket… My ass. You’re just any other lowlife stammer– Looking out for
number one.</p>
<p><strong>int . - jake’s apartment– night</strong>: Lupus and Jake sit
at the table. Lupus on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Hey, boss. It’s me. The bank’s in. It’s
happening tomorrow… Jake? He got a little shaky there for a minute, but
we got him back in the batter’s box.</p>
<p><strong>int. -bulldog gym - same</strong>: The King Pin on a cell
phone. Harlin stands in front of him, punching the King’s stomach hard
enough that he’s sweating. The King seems to hardly notice.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Coupla things. They got this Fed , loo king
around and the girl just split.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: A Fed? Is he close?</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: I don’t think so. Their Fix gave us the heads
up and Jake’s got a plan that’ll probably keep him off.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: But this girl, the redhead. She knows a lot.
She could be a pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. She won’t. She’s not going to be a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>lupu</strong>: He wants to talk to you. Don’t tell him I said
he was jealous of Gillette, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Uh huh… Uh huh… Okay… I understand.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, you know… Don’t fuck this up. I’ll kill
you. I’ll kill your family. I’ll shoot your dog… All the usual. Then he
said good luck.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A FLAPPING SOUND catches Jake and
Lupus’s attention. A WHITE PIGEON sits on the frame of an open
window.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aww, shit!</p>
<p><strong>ext. back alley- night</strong>: With a shrug, Jake
continues…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We were back on.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: After you cut her loose.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She walked.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: I walked? Let me tell you a story,
asshole…</p>
<p><strong>int.- lily’s apartment- night</strong>: Lily stands at a hot
plate in her “kitchen” frying an egg. HEAVY FOOTSTEPS from the hall
catch her attention, growing louder, then stopping at her door. A
KNOCK.</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: Lily?</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: .Jake sent me.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Jake? Hold on. I just got out of the
shower.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Lily rumages in the closet and a
baseball bat. She hefts the bat and takes a stance in front of the door.
More KNOCKING.</p>
<p><strong>hold on!</strong>: Another KNOCK. Lily slowly reaches for the
doorknob. Then the door flies open with a CRASH. Harlin fills the
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: The King would like to have a word with
you.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Uh, right now?</p>
<p><strong>harli</strong>: Please. I have a car waiting.</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: I apologize for the–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Lily shakes her head and points to her
ear and mouths, “Can’t hear you.” Harlin moves closer and they lean into
each other.</p>
<p><strong>i said, i apologize for–</strong>: –The door.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>ext. - back alley- night</strong>: Jake, Butch and Lily…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t know…</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Your friend, Big Al? It should have been
you.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Today? Started off great…</p>
<p><strong>ext.– caymen islands/beach- day</strong>: Crystal blue water
gently rolls onto virgin white sand. A jet cuts a line across the
cloudless sky…</p>

impeccably dressed in a Brooks Brothers suit.</p>

I needed Rottovich and Sobozinski to keep Moonan off our backs and the
only way I could do that was to stay in town and cut them in on the
deal.</p>
<p><strong>int.- 16th precint- same</strong>: Rottovich and Sobozinski
sit around the desks, as Moonan reads the newpaper behind them.</p>

Lupus at a table in the otherwise empty bar.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: He should be landing in the Caymens about

Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every
green light.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: And we got rid of the red head.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And we got rid of the red head.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jake? Customs?</p>
<p>****: They say a good chess player can. See up to twenty moves deep.
That means that in some games, you’ve calculated every possible move in

<p><strong>int. - the euclid bar- same</strong>: Jake hangs up and
immediately dials another number.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: In order to ensure that we weren’t going to
welch, Ashby’s pay-off was to be directly deposited into his own

ecommerce, paper currency has become ” more of a liability than a
commodity. Especially to us.</p>

just an escort. You wanted in, this is in.</p>
<p><strong>int.- 16th precinct/detectives’ office- day</strong>:
Sobozinski behind a desk. Sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine
is Moonan. Rottovich on the phone…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a
black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Don’t worry about Moonan. We got him

going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I’ll
get square with your boss. I’ll get square with whoever did Al. I’ll get
square with everybody. Then I’m going going to cash in my chips and be
on my way to a new and better me far away from here.</p>

<p><strong>int.- bulldog gym/locker room- same</strong>: The King Pin
closes the cell phone and looks over at Harlin, who’s hair is singed and
matted down on one side.</p>

<p><strong>harlin</strong>: I’ll get the car.</p>

this?</p>
<p><strong>harlin</strong>: Looks fine, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>ext.– jfk airport/parking lot- night</strong>: A black
Lincoln Town Car rolls through the parking lot. Behind the wheel we see

Rottovich overlook the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>sosozinski</strong>: You trust this Moonan guy?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: I don’t trust anybody. You see how bad
this guy wants Vig? It’s like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves.
We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I
want to see it right in front of my face.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: It’s just insurance.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: That’s what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: I’m down!</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sobozinski</strong>: High five.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Put your hand down. I don’t high
five.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: You guys awake?</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>int.- jfk airport/terminal- same</strong>: Moonan sits a safe
distance away from an area marked “Customs”. Behind a large table, a few
CUSTOMS OFFICERS in white shirts mill around. Moonan speaks into a mic
hidden in his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Stay sharp.</p>
<p><strong>int . - jet- night</strong>: Gordo sits squashed in the
window seat, next to a VERY</p>
<p><strong>mr. heavyset</strong>: Oh jeez.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- same</strong>: Jake sits at the bar, the

HEAVYSET…</p>

using the bathroom on this plane.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- same</strong>: Jake hangs up…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He’s wheeling around two million dollars in
cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?</p>

looking for a safe place to shit.</p>

wheels.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: So do half the other people in this place.
How do I know which one?</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: I got it figured out… He’s got this thing
with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he’ll be heading for the
john.</p>
<p><strong>king pin</strong>: Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your
sight.</p>
<p><strong>int. – the euclid bar- same</strong>: Jake looks up at a
small digital clock sitting behind the bar. It reads “11:11PM.” Lupus
emerges from the back hallway to find Jake dialing a number.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s up with you? Bladder infection?</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Keep it up.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: You got my cell. Leave a message.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s me. It’s Jake. Listen… It’s happening.
Gordo’s landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid… For your cut, I mean.
It’s… I want you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: You really like that bitch don’t you? I gotta
tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing
her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for
you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you’re into her… That’s
cool.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s what I like about you, Lupus. You’re a
free thinker. Don’t let the King tell you different.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: Not for nothing, Jake, but the guy who
whacked your buddy? It was me. The King usually farms out for that kind
of stuff, but I tell ya, he was so pissed off he couldn’t wait for the
regular guy. Fucker didn’t even put down his Kung Pao Chicken.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake seems to be reeling with the
information.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Egg Foo Young. Stand up.</p>

<p><strong>int.- morgan gillette’s office- night</strong>: MORGAN
GILLETTE sits behind a desk in an ultra modern office, his reptilian
like face fixed straight ahead. Butch leans against the wall behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This is probably about where you came in.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Wow. Now that’s an exciting story. Butch,
has anyone ever tried something like this before?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Not that I recall. What do you want us to do
about it?</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Let’s see… Let’s suppose he gets to
Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to
deal with a criminal investigation. I don’t much like that idea. Then
again, let’s suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that’ll be
something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the
corporate fraud. We double our money.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So we go to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: I think so. The airport’s going to be
crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar.
If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: And how much did you say you wanted for
this… What did you call it? A finder’s fee?</p>
<p><strong>lil</strong>: Ten percent.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Ten? That seems a little high.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Ten is standard, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Fine. But only if we recover the cash.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Only if–? No way. I want something for
this.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Have a little faith in him, honey. Butch,
see if you can get him to tell you how he did it. Or almost did it.
Sounds like a good story.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’ ll ask.</p>
<p><strong>gillette</strong>: Apple?</p>
<p><strong>int.- airport/terminal hallway- night</strong>: We follow
Gordo as he wheels the black suitcase down the long corridor towards the
Customs Desk. Moonan spots Gordo and speaks into his wrist.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: I got him.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the customs desk</strong>: A few TRAVELERS quickly
move past the desk. Gordo approaches a CUSTOMS OFFICER. Gordo lays the
suitcase on the desk: The Customs Officer looks nervously in both
directions before waving Gordo through. Moonan follows at a safe
distance as Gordo clears Customs.</p>
<p><strong>int.- car- same</strong>: Rottovich and Sobozinski check
their guns.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: He’s headed towards the eastern most exit.
Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the

half the roll before gingerly setting his ass down. Suddenly the STALL

floor.</p>
<p><strong>int.- jfk airport/terminal- continuous</strong>: Moonan
watches the door to the Men’s Room as Harlin comes out, wheeling the
black suitcase behind him.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: They pulled a switch. Big guy. Blue suit.
Keep on him.</p>
<p><strong>ext.- jfk airport/parking lot- continuous</strong>: Rottovich
turns the walkie talkie off as he and Sobozinski fall in behind Harlin.
ANGLE ON MILES– Who steps out of his car, watching the little parade go
by with a look of confusion.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- same</strong>: A LOUD THUMPING NOISE… Jake
has Lupus by the hair as he rams his head repeatedly into the bar. Jake
then gets him into a headlock. Lupus snaps his head back and butts Jake
in the nose, sending him staggering back.</p>
<p><strong>tnt.- jfk airport/terminal- same</strong>: Moonan taps the
mic hidden in his sleeve, then checks the walkie.</p>
<p><strong>moonan</strong>: Hello? Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>ext.- jfk airport/parking lot- same</strong>: Harlin gets to
the King Pin’s car and opens the back door. As he crams the suitcase in,
Rottovich and Sobozinski come up behind him, guns drawn.</p>
<p><strong>rottovich</strong>: Hey asshole.</p>
<p><strong>int.- the euclid- same</strong>: Jake goes flying into the
bar. Lupus pushed Jake back up against the bar and lands a series of
body blows. Jake manages to grab the phone and whips it across Lupus’
head, sending him to the ground. Jake straddles Lupus and raises the
phone for the last whack. We HEAR A LOUD CLICK. Jake stops and the two
slowly get up. As they stand, we can see that Lupus has the barrel of a
small gun in Jake’s mouth. Jake shuts his eyes tight, still holding the
phone. Which just then, RINGS. Jake opens his eyes and looks at the
phone. Then to Lupus, who nods. Jake picks up the receiver and speaks,
the gun still in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Eww-Whoa?</p>
<p><strong>ext.- jfk airport/parking lot- same</strong>: Miles on a cell
phone…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Jake! I don’t know what’s going on! The King
Pin… He’s here and he just got pinched. I think with the twinkies! It
looks like half the police department’s down here!</p>
<p><strong>int. - the euclid bar- same</strong>: Jake drops the phone
and looks at Lupus.</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Eee Oott Auught!</p>
<p><strong>lupus</strong>: Sorry. What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a

<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aaaaiiit!!! Ooopusss!!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake lets the gun fall and Looks up to

the front of his teeth.</p>

like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Alright… Turn around. She doesn’t get shit,
unless I get that money. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Probably safe in the hands of the Federal
Government.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let
Lily here down again.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: BUTCH</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s like putting on a play, where everyone
knows their part except for the mark.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Like putting on a play… Guess some people
forgot their lines.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Guess so.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So why don’t you take a deep breath, Jake,
and I’ll count to ten. One. Two. Three…</p>

SCREECHES out of his parking space.</p>

<p><strong>butch</strong>: Jesus Christ! Tell me before you do something

<p><strong>ext.- jfk airport/parking lot- night</strong>: POLICE
OFFICERS and FEDERAL AGENTS in windbreakers swarm all over the parking
lot. The King and Harlin are bent over the hood of the car, cuffed. One
Federal Agent pulls the black suitcase out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But maybe I can’t blame Lily. Maybe I just
should have just trusted her to play her part. Because playing the big
con is like putting on a play. A play where everyone knows their part
except for the Mark…</p>
<p><strong>int.- diner</strong>: Jake sits with Lily, Miles and Gordo

<p><strong>int.- the euclid/bathroom</strong>: Lupus on the cellphone to
the King…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And like in a game of chess, you’ve played

want it, you gotta get it at the airport…</p>
<p><strong>ext.- jfk airport/parking lot- night</strong>: POLICE
OFFICERS and FEDERAL AGENTS in windbreakers swarm around the King Pin’s
car.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then you give them the “Blow-off”. You get

became friends.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Lupus nods, satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>int.- customs desk</strong>: Gordo hoists the suitcase onto
the desk. The Customs Officer looks around nervously. We see he’s
looking at Moonan in the B.G., who gives him a nod.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Like Suits said, sooner or later someone’s
going to start asking the right questions.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Rottovich and Sobozinski would ask how the
drugs got in that suitcase. The King and Gillette would ask where the
money really went.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And all of them would ask what agency Special
Agent Gunther Moonan worked for.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But what do I care? I’m dead…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No one’s going to ask me:</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Drop something?</p>
