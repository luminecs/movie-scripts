<h1 id="at-first-sight">at-first-sight</h1>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m lost Betsy, and you know me - I don’t wear
lost well - wait, wait I’m losing you… I’m pulling over before you
disappear forever.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sign? I was looking for a sign? There’s no…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes… I took the first ….. no, no, I’m
listening…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Wait, I got it - yeah. No don’t call me..
right, unless you hear from Atlanta. And fax me the designs - I want to
tinker with them a bit more … I’m going to rest - bye - I’ll see you in
a week.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh p-lease, Whitney.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: � we have a full weight room, lifecycles,
stairmasters, a spa, yoga, aerobics, spin classes…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m really just looking for a quick fix, here.
Do you have anything that just involves lying down?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: A massage.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Great. I’ll have one a day. Not too early.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Virgil, Oh God…, right there.
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Yes there - a bit more… –wait - wait,
you can’t stop - one more minute - noo!</p>
<p><strong>virgil’s voice</strong>: Sorry, Susan - time’s up. I’ve got
someone waiting.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Virgil, you have to come live with me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil’s voice</strong>: And what would your husband say?
Amy, you out there? - c’mon in.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: That’s it - I’m getting a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey, Amy, I’m Virgil - why don’t you get
ready - hop up on the table.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sounds like you’re a genius at this.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That’s right.. Mozart, Einstein, Virgil
Anderson, massage therapist. Now I’m going to start working somewhat
deep - you let me know if you want anything deeper.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Deeper is good - where I come from, all you get
is shallow.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I like that - deep it is.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: First time in Pinecrest?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Came in late last night.. missed the town
completely.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: If you came in broad daylight, you could
still miss the town completely.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Too much compute? work.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Bad chair - you should think about a
change.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Too deep?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No.. ….. just right.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I - I’m sorry - it was too deep…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - it.. It’s not you.. It’s just things have
kinda built up, I don’t know why I’m crying.. look, this is
embarrassing…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Don’t be embarrassed - you obviously needed
it. We should stop for today.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah, thanks. You always make the girls
cry.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Not since grade school. I’m going to go now
- unless you’d like me to stay.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Could you - just for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Of course, whatever you need.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You ever feel like a Martian’s invaded your
entire body?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Every day.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey Caroline, you look incredible today.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Quite a compliment, Virgil. See ya
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - wait…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil, hey.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s Amy - Amy Tremont.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Of course - you were sleeping, didn’t want
to wake you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes thanks - you’re the skater, right - I saw
you last night, coming in. Pretty mean slapshot. You play on some team
or something?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah, something. You a hockey fan?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Always liked it - never get around to seeing a
game. But I loved to skate as a kid - unfortunately I have two left
feet.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: They look perfectly OK with me.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I love the view you get here.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Same here - I never get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Well, this is my ride. Hey Tommy, my
man.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Virge.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, I just wanted to apologize for back there
- blubbering like that - I was just in a weird place.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: And now…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Now, I’m fine - so I wanted to thank- you. For
what you did.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: For making you cry.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, I made me cry - and you handled it great -
didn’t freak or anything. Is my mascara smeared or something?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re just looking at me funny.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Virgil - lets move it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: As I said earlier - I just never get used to
the view.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: See you… oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re, you’re – I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey, you already apologized once - no need
to overdo it. Bye now.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Get of f the couch, Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Some seeing eye dog - more like sleeping eye
dog.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Met a girl today - nice voice - followed me
out of the building.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No she wasn’t a stalker.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Sophie’s just worried about you - she
watches too many horror movies.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey, you’re here - so how are the kids
today?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: The usual - need a lot of attention. So
who’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: From the spa. I made her cry.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: You haven’t done that since–</p>
<p><strong>virgil/jennie</strong>: – grade school.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That’s what I told her. Coke?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’m fine. Your dinner’s ready - chicken’s at
3 o’clock - rice is at…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: 6 o’clock, peas at 9 o’clock and news at
11.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: One day I’m going to switch them on you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: And one day I’ll play forward for the New
York Rangers.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Or a new sister.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’d work on the jokes.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You want to watch some hockey?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: You want to grade some spelling tests? I’ll
be next door you need me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You know this girl - for one moment - she
actually thought I could I’m not kidding. And she had this great voice -
relaxing - soft like a breeze through Wonder what she thinks about
“blind dates.”</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil..?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: My turn to apologize. I should have told you
I was blind it wasn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s OK. You want to come in - I just got out
of the shower - give me a minute to get changed?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Sure, I promise I won’t look.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Anyways, I was in the neighborhood –
actually the whole town’s my neighborhood – and since you’ve never been
to our illustrious village, I thought maybe we could go into town - see
what we see.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: See what we see?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Figure of speech .</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You mean right now, tonight?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Great - I’m blind and you’re deaf - what a
pair.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: … the Mechanic at the top of the street is
Doug - smokes too much - but a good guy. Three steps down is Carlson’s
hardware - he’s got a laugh like a donkey - we sometimes listen to games
together - he’s a Devil’s fan. And just up ahead should be Grady’s junk
shop - he calls it “antiques”… Smells like junk. I’d hate to see what it
looks like .</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hey Virgil - got that book in for you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Nancy’s our librarian, brings in any braille
book I want.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The guy’s nuts about the pyramids - anything
he can get his hands on…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Thank-you Nancy - you should get your
groceries home - your ice cream’s melting.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Nice place - you seem to know everyone
here.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Moved here when I was eight. My family
figured it would be a good place for me to grow up. Tell me what you
see.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, there’s a good structure to the town -
genuine lines, good use of space. To be honest I’d find a better balance
to a lot of these buildings. But that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What’s you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The architect in me - can’t leave well enough
alone. Art school in college - I made the arms for the Venus DeMilo.
see, the Venus De Milo has no arms and…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I know the Venus De Milo has no arms, and
the Mona Lisa has this captivating smile and David doesn’t wear a fig
leaf.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How do you…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I may not have been a lot of places - but I
read about things, then make an image up here – –that works for me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This is the end of the street. We should
turn back.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What about past the end of the street? What’s
out there?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - there’s an old run down building off to
the side…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Must be the old firehouse. It had a fire so
they shut it down. Honest to God. What else do you see?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: A wall of shrubs - a field with an interesting
configuration of trees.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Tell me how you see it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: OK, sure. Let’s see - long and elegant. Like –
like a woman dancing with two lovers, trying to decide which one she
loves.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s just - the image you just gave me -
“Dancing trees. - I like that.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: We should go - it’s starting to rain.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There’s a bit of a breeze but–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I can’t believe how fast it happens…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You like rain - I love the rain.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What were you just doing there?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Listening - the rain - it brings out the
contours of everything, gives life to a room I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You hear it?…on the roof dripping down the
walls on every side. On the right, on the drainpipe, it’s drumming with
a deeper, steadier sound - - like a timpani - echoing across the room -
tells me the room is large - open. You feel it - in your chest? On the
left, the rain says… …a fire escape, with it’s own rhythm - ping - ping.
Then listen - there… –what’s that - over there…?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Looks like it’s…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No, listen for it - not what it looks like -
what it becomes. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Now just listen to it - shut out everything
but that sound - do you hear it?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes - there - it’s soft - like a shimmer</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The wind blowing the rain against a
window.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Like a cymbal. It’s like our own percussive
symphony, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The world is invisible to me - with my touch
it comes alive. But only one thing at a time. But when it’s raining, I
feel everything at once. Sometimes, I wish it could rain inside rain all
around us.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: “Einfuehlung.”</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Einfuehlung - it’s an architectural term. It
means to share an empathy. Been a long time since I felt that.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You’re cold, we should go.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, I’m fine, really. It was just something
passing through me - can’t explain it - a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What you just showed me � how I feel - makes me
smile.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I see it now. Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I thought after yesterday, you’d never get
up on my table again.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You kidding? today, I’m looking for a complete
nervous breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I love a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: Virgil’s hands on the small of her
back - something amazingly sensual about how he works her muscles. Amy
speaks to him in low tones - in a state of complete relaxation.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Can I ask how long you’ve been blind?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Of course, most people avoid the subject.
You tell them you’re blind and they act surprised. “You’re blind?
Reallv? I didn’t know - you hide it so well.” And then they wave their
hand in front of your face just to make sure. It started when I was a
little over a year old.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You see shadows?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No. Congenital cataracts. And a case of
retinitis pigmentosa thrown in for good measure. This area needs to
loosen up.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I think you’re doing it. No bright lights,
nothing?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m blind as a bat. Actually, blinder ’cause
they emit sonar all the time. I don’t have a sixth sense, I just don’t
have the fifth one. I can’t hear things in Vermont, can’t smell if
you’re mad at me, and, no - I don’t know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or
Stevie Wonder.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You say something?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, I just - this feels nice - too nice.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re very good.. at what you do.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: At times. Some clients make it more
enjoyable than others.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: And this client…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Is very, very…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Sorry - it’s time. I’ve got Mr. Ketchum
coming in next - all two hundred pounds. Sorry - I felt like we were
just getting started.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thank-you. For last night as well - love to do
it again.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: How about I cook dinner then, tonight.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Amy �</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - it’s Amy. I - I can’t make dinner -
I’m really sorry - an emergency came up - they’re dragging me back to
New York.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Oh. Yeah. Anything serious?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The project we were working on was rejected -
could go down the drain. I’ll deal with it quick - I’d like to come
back.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah. Good. Well. I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Shit - that was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m just saying there seems to be something
missing.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Absolutely Mr. Falk - something lj missing -
we realize that now. We just need some time to figure out what.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: Fine - but you all know what kind of schedule
we’re on here?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: And budget. Yes sir. Don’t worry, we won’t
let you down.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Don’t say it, I know. You were never happy
with the design.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I wasn’t going to say that.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: But you’d have tinkered with it till the job
went away. So now we’ve got him hooked, you’ve got your second
chance.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look at these site photos - see those trees -
we were going to get rid of them - let’s incorporate them into the
design use what’s natural about the location. And by the way - the 53rd
St. lobby - coming back from Pinecrest, I came up with a new addition -
add some life to that place.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: OK – what’s going on here? We sent Hydra the
three headed monster off a few days ago and got back Mary Poppins in
return.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What? I can’t have a couple of ideas. Fine, you
want to know - I met a guy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Too modern for me.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Sit down.Betsy. We’re all friends here. So -
spill the beans.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Nothing to spill - he’s a good guy - smart,
funny, blind…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Whoa, whoa - wait a minute - Blind!? Like
tap-tap, white cane blind? Come on Amy - I mean, I know you like
challenges, hell you married me - but…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I knew you’d be understanding.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: No, no I am. You’re right, this is none of
my business anymore - but a blind guy? If you’re lonely - in my. opinion
– get a puppy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Duncan, don’t be a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You still work here.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: He’s just jealous.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So much for the “we’re all friends here”
idea.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Everybody’s gone for the day.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thanks. You go ahead - I’m just finishing up
something here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What? I just want to know a little more about
what’s wrong with him.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Amy? Friend to friend?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shoot</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: I hate to admit it but I agree with Duncan on
this one.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Don’t shoot.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: He makes sense sometimes. My father had a
problem a few years back with severe cataracts. Do you have any idea
what you’re getting into?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You ever listened to rain - I mean really
listened?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: This like that smell the roses thing?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ve spent the last five years of my adult life
with a man who has the emotional content of a soap dish. The only time I
saw him cry was doing our tax return three years ago. I need more than
that, Betsy. For once in a long, long time I feel like I can breathe
again. Just the way he touches me I know I found someone I can connect
with.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Ah, here we go.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, no. I can tell he’s sensing everything
about me with a simple touch. He listens to my every word as if it’s the
only sound on the planet - I feel like even though he can’t see me, he
knows everything about me. He just moves me - does that sound crazy.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Does he have a brother?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Wayne Gretzky, look out.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sorry – sorry. Didn’t mean to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy?!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I said I’d come back.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: How long … how long have you been…?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Watching you? Just got here - couldn’t find you
at the spa - took a chance you’d be here. You’re very good.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Skated since I was a kid. My dad taught me -
wanted me to play pro one day. How do you like my pond?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Describe it for me.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: OK. Let’s see. Like cool blue silk - you know
blue?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I think so - keep going.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Blue silk stretched tight across a bowl -
surrounded by white jacketed sentries of trees on the horizon,
protecting it from the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Horizon’s a tough one.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Never understood horizon - if touch it -
don’t know what it that’s OK I liked the rest of picture. You want to
skate?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sorry, I didn’t bring my skates.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Don’t need them. Come on step hold of my
stick.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hockey stick. Here.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: OK. Now hold on for balance. I used to do
this with Jennie when we were kids.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look out - we’re running out of ice.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Fine. Never been dumped so fast in my life.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Me, dump you? No way. Stay where you are -
I’ll come to you - just keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do I say?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Anything - how’d you become an
architect?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: God - let’s see - I was in college - art school
- a little aimless - and I met this guy -. an architect - opened up a
new world to me. I liked the structure the control - finding problems,
coming up with solutions - when I graduated - we started a company
together - on impulse got married - which was crazy - divorced a year
ago - but we’re still partners.. which must seem even crazier.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You’d think I meant to do that. A patented
move.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This is tough.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I bat my eyelashes, toss my head just right,
and there’s this very sexy thing I do with my eyes - then realize none
of it matters to you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It doesn’t matter. Tell me what you look
like.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I.. .1 don’t know I’m…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Wait. Let me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Eyes, mouth, chin, cheek.. you are very
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thank-you. So are you - more than I could
describe.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So – that’s what a blind date is.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’m Jennie, Virgil’s sister. And you
are..?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Jen, this is Amy Tremont.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I was just at the market Virgil, picking up
a few things before school - and I thought you might like some…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Apples and bananas. Amy sees the fruit on
the counter - impressed.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: He’s being a show-off, Amy - I always bring
him these. The apples are on the bottom shelf…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: At two o’clock. Oranges at 10. I know,
thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Amy – you in town long…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No you’re not - you’re bleeding. First
lesson with a blind man, Amy - don’t change anything - it’s too
dangerous</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m sorry - I didn’t know…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It was my fault. I’m OK.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Goddamit, Jennie - I said I was OK - leave
me alone!</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’ve got parent meetings tonight - there’s
dinner in the freezer - left corner. Nice to have met you, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Me too - and again - I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: She seemed … nice.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: She seemed jealous.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Your leg is still bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’ll stop - happens all the time. Welcome
to my world. We hold on Amy - taking this in:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Let’s see if I can get this right. Chicken’s at
three - salad at seven - vegetables at ten.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Very good - thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This is nice. They do this every weekend?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Every Friday - for the guests leaving.
Supposed to make them want to come back.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Love the music - Gershwin - makes you want
to…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You like dancing?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hmmm? Yeah - don’t do it much. Chicken’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Nothing like a good pat of fat. What do you
say we dance?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, really, I’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Come on</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Lead on.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Different piece - maybe we should…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You kidding - take my hand.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You have to teach me that move.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Betsy - you were telling me about your father,
his cataracts - you said he had a problem. How is he now? Doctor -
Dr. Aaron? - do you have his number?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil, I just got some great news.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The Atlanta project?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, no - I was talking to my assistant this
morning - her father had these severe cataracts…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Oh. Really.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: She put me in touch with a Dr. Richard Aaron -
the guy’s the leading eye surgeon on the eastern seaboard - he’s been
working with techniques - I don’t know all the jargon - but I spoke to
him earlier on the phone at the Institute…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You called this guy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I told him all about you - he just faxed me
back - he’d love to get a look at your eyes - he thinks maybe, mavbe -
there might be a chance of reversal.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I don’t get it - am I missing the sign that
says it’s help the handicapped week.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I thought you’d be excited. What’s the
problem?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No problem. That’s the whole point here Amy
- there is no goddamned problem.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker</strong>: Hey Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Amy, right?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’d like to talk to you if I could – about
Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sort of. There’s something I don’t understand.
You see I spoke to a doctor who’s apparently doing breakthrough work on
cataracts - - but when I brought it up to Virgil he acted as if…</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: What don’t you understand?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: If I was blind almost all my life – and there
was even a remote possibility I could see - I’d jump at it.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: When there’s something you’ve adapted to,
accepted - you’d just want to change it without even thinking about it?
We’re very comfortable here, Amy. Virgil has everything he needs.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I thought just maybe he’d like to not be
falling over things for the rest of his life. Look, I see…</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Yes you do and Virgil doesn’t. He spent the
first eight years of his life having his eyes prodded, pierced and poked
by doctors, faith healers, spiritualists, shamans and medicine men. My
father had them lined up out the door. It hurt and disappointed us all
and it almost killed him. He doesn’t need to go through that again. Now
- maybe you understand.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No, no - why - why?!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I can’t believe you’re doing this to me.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What - Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Sophie - stop it. Amy? C’mon in - it’s just
the Rangers. I could check better than these guys today.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They lost?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I prefer to think of it as not winning. I
thought you would have been long gone after that outburst from my evil
twin brother. We’ve had him committed you know. Rikers Island - hard
time. Can I get you something - - Coke - beer?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - I - I’m fine. I just wanted apologize for
stomping around in life like Bigfoot today.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy, you see the big tree outside? How far
is it from my front porch?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Guessing, about thirty feet.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: To you. But to me, it’s fourteen steps
exactly. Fourteen steps and I arrive right where I want to be. But – if
I run or rush, I’ll lose count and slam into it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m sorry. Told you - can’t leave well enough
alone. I - I guess I should get back, start to pack…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Rushing into trees again?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You know this dinner - this is really
quite…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Ordinary? It’s an acquired taste - trust me.
Jennie thinks it’s the only way I’ll know where my food is. But I have a
secret weapon. Hot sauce! Let’s you know you’re eating something - like
some.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s OK - I’ll do it. Don’t want to overdo
it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - I have to go home tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Wait, wait - you smell that?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - what?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The winter pines - it’s so strong at night -
drifts on the wind - wait - hear the breeze then…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m here - trouble sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Amy’s face - the voices awaken her -
cutting into her dreams.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Morning - Look, something I want
to say…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The leaving thing - I know - hate it too.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The other night - when we were dancing -
being with you - I felt different - special - I don’t know - whole.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That was whole?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Just for a second I felt like I could see
you - all of you. What you said about this Doctor, this eye guy - I know
how important it is to you…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Are you sure you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: We’re just going to talk to the guy - what
could it hurt? Off Amy’s smile:</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re going to love the city - so many things
to see.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Waitwaitwait - he hasn’t said he can even do
anything yet.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I know I just feel good about this. Virgil,
before you lost all sight, do you remember seeing anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah, I do. I was just a baby when it
happened - but there is one thing. Something … puffy. That’s all I
remember about it. Everyone says it’s “clouds,” but I know I had it in
my hands - so it couldn’t be clouds. This puffy thing - that was
something special - it’s stayed with me all these years - I don’t know
why.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: OK - we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Some good news. You have grade 4 posterior
subscapular cataracts.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: And this is the good news?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Good news in that I should be able to remove
them with little or no damage to your cornea.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So – what does that mean - they’re gone - then
what?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The cataracts are acting like a curtain -
covering the window of sight. If the disease to the retina is reduced as
much as I think it is - there’s a very good possibility we can give you
sight.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Sounds expensive.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: We feel there’s an opportunity for us all
here - I think I can get the institute to pick up the bill.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: So. Say you remove the cataracts - do you
have any idea what kind of vision I’d have?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: At this time - no. Unfortunately the
cataracts are not allowing me to see the retinal wall. I can’t tell how
advanced the retinitas pigmentosa has become.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: So you’re suggesting an operation that may
or may not be successful.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But there is a chance he could regain his
sight.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: There have been a few cases of restored
vision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth. The operation is
delicate, I’ll admit - but nothing as invasive as what you went through
as a child. Of course there is always some risks with any operation -
infection, swelling - long shot stuff. I would do both eyes at the same
time - it’s basically out patient surgery. Virgil - an exhale of air. A
lot to take in.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What if it doesn’t work? What if I have the
operation - with all it’s risks - and you remove the cataract - and it
doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It would be evident that you will never be
able to see.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That’s what I need - to think.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This is my place - there’s a park across the
street and…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Ethan!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sorry - my mom won’t let me go outside till
she gets home from work.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, if the super catches you playing ball in
the hall, he’ll have a coronary.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Never mind. Ethan, this is my friend
Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey, Ethan</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Are you blind?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Cool. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey, the kid thinks I’m cool - what’s so
bad.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This is where I hang my hat - it’s a bit of a
mess but…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Now, Blind 101. Help me out with a mental
map. Walk me down a straight line and show me your place, all the
obstacles. Remember once you’ve told me, they can’t be moved -
otherwise…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Got it - here take my arm. Couch, chair, TV to
the left, low table at.. .at 4 o’clock, has the phone on it…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Nothing. A sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: My art school days - not very good.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s a mother? - holding her child - up in
the air - like she’s proud? It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s not done yet - one day I’ll finish it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Does this window open? I could use some
air.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The wind - knocked over my plans.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What is this - these plans?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Just my work - - some plans for the Atlanta
project we’re bidding on - drawings of a lobby we’re finishing up, some
other smaller stuff. It’s – it’s what I do.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ve got to get to work. Tonight we’ll do
something - we could listen to music or go out for dinner…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: How about a movie?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: A movie?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah. I haven’t been in years.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Alright. A movie. I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There’s these big pots and Woody’s got a huge
lobster in his hand…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Lobster - what’s a lobster?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s a.. .kind of like.. it’s got…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s it - you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: And they lived happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Woody and Diane…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: And the lobster?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stop with the lobster.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey - you here that?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey - can you turn that up?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: “The way you comb your hair, The way you sip
your tea…”</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil?!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: “Can’t take that away from meee” - what?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: People are watching.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Watching? Watching what?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You. Me. Everyone is staring at us.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well - it can be embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Oh - I see.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do you mean?! You mean it. I mean I only
want you to have the operation…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy. I want the chance to see. The chance to
see Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, apples, raisins, a buffalo, a
carbuerator and the man in the moon. But I would give all that up - just
to see this face.</p>
<p><strong>amy/virgil</strong>: “You can’t take that away from me.”</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: a platter of silver utensils - fine,
exacting scalpels. A gloved HAND comes into frame - picks up a clamp -
and we follow it to:</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: OK Virgil - let’s get to it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Coffee? It’s really bad.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil never mentions his parents - do they
know?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Our mother died when I was 20 - Virgil
wasn’t even a teenager. And our father - he’s been gone for quite
awhile.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: You’re right this is bad.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It must have been very tough on you - taking
care of Virgil alone after your mother died.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: He’s my brother.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You don’t like Virgil doing this - do you?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I don’t like Virgil getting hurt. Hope is
like fire, it can keep you warm - - or it can burn you.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Virgil’s eye. Cut open. Aaron’s probe
working right in the middle of it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. aaron</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>dr. aaron</strong>: You know what they say, Virgil? The eyes
are the windows to the soul.</p>
<p><strong>dr. aaron</strong>: That makes us the Windex to the soul. OK,
both eyes done. Let’s patch him up.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Jennie?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: How’re you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: OK - a little pain, like a tequila hang over
- is Amy here?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Right here - Dr. Aaron said you did great</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: So how’s my hair - I’d hate the first time I
see myself to be a bad hair day. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: There’s camera guys here too.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Camera guys?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: For posterity. We’re going to make you
famous. We’re also sending this closed circuit to one of our conference
rooms - there’s a lot of people interested in our results today. So how
you feel Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Good. Great. Fine. Nervous.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Nothing to be nervous about. Now Jennie and
Amy, if you would stand off to my right – I want Virgil to get just a
slight bounce of light. Ready Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Okay - last phase - we remove these patches
and…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Okay - wait. So - so - what do I do? I mean,
what will I see first?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well - we’re all here - Amy, your sister.
This is new for us all. Why don’t we find out?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What is it Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s - it’s - I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Virgil - what do you see?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil what’s wrong? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Everything’s fine - it’s going to take…</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: It’s not fine - don’t say it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Tell me what you’re seeing Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I don’t know - it’s all screwed up - this
can’t be seeing - something’s wrong - too confusing - what the hell’s
happening??!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What is it - Stop!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What? The camera?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Stop moving!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil, it’s just the camera.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Alright - alright - they’ve stopped. OK.
Let’s everybody just calm down - we’ll take it slowly.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil. What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I gotta focus - gotta think - gimme a second
- OK, OK - get me a coke. Somebody?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: He’s thirsty - someone get him a drink!!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No - just a can - a bottle – put something
in my hands!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Here - how’s this?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Good, Virgil - that’s it - use your touch -
associate - now, tell me - what do you see in your hand?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: A can. Is it a can?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He’s associating - one sense to the other.
His fingers tell his brain - then his brain tells his eyes and he
recognizes the image in front of him. He’s seeing!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Virgil - let’s rest your eyes for today and
we’ll check them again tomorrow. We should all be happy - we’ve got
something.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What just happened in there?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You saw it. Success.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Success - wait a minute - then why can’t he see
me, his sister, anything.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He sees you. He just doesn’t understand that
he sees you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But he’ll overcome it - I mean - this is
temporary right?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: There’s a very real possibility the part of
his brain area allocated to vision is atrophied - given it’s lack of
use, Virgil has probably used it for some other function.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: You didn’t think of this?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: We had no way of knowing what his faculties
were until we gave him the operation. If you remember - we didn’t know
what to expect - though it’s clear his retinal disease must be in
remission.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So what are we supposed to do now - you saw him
- it’s like he’s another person in there.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He won’t need to stay here - take him home -
let him rest. But I will need to see him every couple of days for the
next month.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Isn’t there some kind of therapy he should be
doing - someone to help him.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: OK, there is a visual therapist - Ray Webster
- a little unorthodox - that’s why he’s probably your best bet,
especially considering the unique aspects of Virgil’s condition. I’ll
contact him for you - but there’s no guarantee he can help.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Jennie, I told Amy here when we first talked
- this is whole new ground - for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Is there…?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Duncan - I know the additions to the mall will
cost more.. look, I can’t do this on the phone - I’ll be in tomorrow..
yes, I remembered they’re putting the fixtures in the lobby - I’ll get
there as well - I’m just asking for one more day.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: No - it’s Jennie.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’m sorry - I’ll move slower - I just…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This is you.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: This is me.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Everything’s going to be alright - we just
need to get you home.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No, no - I can’t go home. I need to be here
- see the therapist - doctor’s. I want to be here.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: But I can’t stay here - and you can’t do
this alone–who’s going to take care.. .?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Amy? She’s going to look after you? She
doesn’t know anything about the blind.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m not blind anymore - and I’m not going to
let someone I care about walk out of my life again.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: It’s not your fault he left. You can’t keep
blaming yourself.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m staying here.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Amy?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Virgil’s finishing getting ready. Could you
walk me to my car?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I’m scared to death. I’ve spent my whole
life looking for any holes he might fall in. I’d run up ahead and cover
them. Everywhere I look here, I see holes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please believe me - I don’t want him to get
hurt anymore than you do.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Amy - when Virgil was very young, he
couldn’t see those close to him - so he never learned to reach out.
Don’t expect him to reach out when he’s in pain, or confused, or
unhappy. If you really care about him you have to just be there for
him.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This is just great - I don’t believe this.
What’s that saying - stop the world I wanna get off.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hey Virgil, it’s Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That you Ethan?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s me - and this is my mom.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - Karen.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hi, Virgil - heard a lot about you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You look funny.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You should see how I look from this
side.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Wait, wait, what are we doing</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s OK - it’s not a wall - it’s just a
staircase. You’re going to have to trust me on these things.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: God, I feel like… like such a child - I just
thought seeing would be different.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We’ll get a hold of this Ray Webster guy -
we’ll get his help.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Man. Something exploded in your
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I wanted to do something special for you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s making me a little bit dizzy - but it
is special.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Okay - so - this is what beautiful looks
like.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thank-you. You want to see the rest. Focusing
on her, Virgil smiles, takes her face in his hands - leans in and kisses
her. She pulls back a little.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I can’t believe this - how nervous I am.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What if you don’t like what you see?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Do you want me to turn off the lights?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - no. This is your first seeing day. I want
you to see everything.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yes, very OK.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I can’t sleep - I’m afraid if I close my
eyes…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’ll be black when you open them again.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You enjoy sculpting?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: At first. I liked the idea of molding - taking
the way I saw things up here- - - and making it take shape with my
hands.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: But you never finish them.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Pieces never come out the way I wanted - the
way I saw them. I end up working on them forever - like this one - never
getting them right.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This is what rain looks like?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It looks lonely. Not what I expected. But I
like it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’ve got to alter each of the windows by five
feet…</p>
<p><strong>draftsman</strong>: These are the specs you gave me.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I know - I’m changing them - this is better.
Betsy!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Can you get me some research on those Maple
trees we’re leaving in. They’re too big - I want to change them so they
fit in with the design better. Get rid of the dead weight.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Don’t you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes, yes. Thank-you. Evan here will print out
the new specs - give them to Duncan - tell him I’ll be back in two
hours.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Amy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Just give me two hours.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Right - OK, Virgil - says here you went
blind at one - before you developed a visual vocabulary. You have no
sense of depth of field, no knowledge of space, shape, size or distance.
Basically your eyes work but your brain hasn’t learned to process the
information. You are mentallv blind. Neurologists call this “visual
agnosia”.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I call it pretty screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Better term. I’ll make a note of that.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Dammit</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Glasses, can never find ’em.
Mrs. Fenster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: OK. Alberto Valvo “Sight Restoration after
Long Term Blindness” - blah-blah-blah. - ah here… “One must die as a
blind person to be born again as a sighted person. However it is the
interim, the limbo- -between two worlds, one dead/the other powerless to
be born - that is so terrible.” There. You’re in limbo.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do you mean - there - he’s in limbo.
That’s all you have to offer?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: What? - I’m Anne Bancroft all of a sudden?
I’m a professor - I teach people, how to teach the blind how to become
independent. There’s no book on what you’re going through - I’d like to
help - but like the rest of things in life - it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Wait a minute - up to me? I thought you were
going to help me here.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You want a lesson? Right - here. What’s
this?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s an apple.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Good. Good. OK. What’s this now?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s an apple.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Good. Good. But is it an apple or just a
picture of an apple?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: So this is a joke? Is that what you’re
saying - your eyes lie to you? Great - looking forward to this.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Your eyesight can and will play tricks on
you Virgil. Remember that. No matter what I could teach you - no matter
what exercises I could give you - they’ll still play tricks on you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That’s all it is right now - one big trick.
Nothing makes any sense. I can’t function like this.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Virgil - look - you have to learn to see -
just like you learned to speak. Only this is not like learning a new
language - it’s like learning language for the first time. Perception -
sight - life, is about experience - about reaching out and exploring the
world for yourself. It’s not enough to just see Virgil – – we’ve got to
look as well.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, thank-you Obi Wan Kenobi - but that
doesn’t tell us anything. What we need is some assistance here - some
kind of program - a set of exercises - we’re kind of adrift and…</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Amy - last I checked - this isn’t a game of
Parcheesi, it doesn’t come with a set of rules.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I can’t believe you’re just…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, wait, Virgil…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Let’s go. Thank-you Dr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You want me - I’m always here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m going to call Aaron - get him to recommend
someone else.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: He’s right, Amy. I’ve got to do this on my
own. No one taught you how to see.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I was a baby then - I had years to learn - you
don’t - you need to… –we don’t even know what to do - where to
start..</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What’s this - this thing?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What - it’s a mailbox.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What color is it?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Blue.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Blue. OK, good - that’s a mailbox - it’s
blue. There - we’ve started.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I want to walk. I want to see what’s out
there.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Fine. Let’s walk.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Don’t you have a job?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m going to make time for this. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Go to work. If I need you - I have your
number.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Screw work - let’s go try those eyes.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Now just two weeks after surgery–the patient
is still having difficulty understanding images, shapes, contours -</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: - and his progress with depth of field has
been especially slow…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Virgil is still very reliant on his touch to
interpret objects in his surroundings -</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: - and his understanding of three
dimensionality is extremely limited and confounding to him…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s a dog.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Now what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: I believe we have just the tree you’re
looking for your lobby. Needs very little light - slow growing - ah here
we are…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Nice. Good. What do you think Virgil?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: He is also still having great difficulty
“scanning”, basically putting a whole picture together.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: If he looks at the top of a tree - then scans
to the bottom - he’s forgotten the top by the time he reaches the
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: This includes the ability to read. In reading
a word - he forgets the first letter by the time he gets to the
last.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: – meaning … he has a total lack of visual
memory. This is an unexpected physiological flaw. We are hopeful Virgil
can overcome this. Thank-you - that’s all for today.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: A camera - it’s OK - taking your - picture.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What, by flashing me in the face?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Please!! - It’s not good for him.</p>
<p><strong>christie evans</strong>: Mr. Anderson. Christie Evans
Eyewitness news. We heard the Doctor speak about your progress - and
we’re wondering what your expectations are.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Information. Pinecrest. For a Jennie
Anderson..</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Uh uh uh. See it first. No cheating.
Concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: A pen. I don’t know - let me touch it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: A fork.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Right.. Now put it down in front of you. How
far is it from.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Twenty feet</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re not looking.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Dammit, Amy, Amy, I spent all day in front
of that panel feeling like a guinea pig. Every time I open my eyes I
have to look. Can we just sit and have dinner for once?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m just trying to help you see.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I know. But that’s all it seems we’re about.
How was your day - what goes on at work - how about those Rangers - did
the stock market hold today - is there anything else going on in our
world besides my eyes?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: OK, we’ve been invited to a party - Duncan’s
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What’s this - looks like worms.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s spaghetti - it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I brought you a present - good for hand eye
coordination.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Great - you go to work building buildings -
I go home with building blocks.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m here for you to wish me happy birthday.
How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: OK. He’s progressing, slowly - doing the best
he can.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I was actually wondering about the mall
designs. We’re expected in Atlanta tomorrow - with these plans.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I can’t go to Atlanta tomorrow - not with
Virgil’s problems,..</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Ok, ok I’m sorry. Things aren’t going so
well?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He seems blinder now than he ever was.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Do you ever wonder why you do the things you
do?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Didn’t get what you expected did you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sometimes I think he’s not going to make it -
that he’s never going to be able to see.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Amy - listen to me. You liked this guy - I
saw that. You wanted to help him - it didn’t work out so hot. You can’t
punish yourself.. Sometimes things just don’t work out the way we want
them to - look at us.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah. Thanks Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Anytime. Now back to work.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hey, Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Measuring cup?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Cheese grater.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yes - my man.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Got me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You’re no help. How am I supposed to do my
homework if…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Homework - dude - I ain’t doin’ homework.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re lucky you got a cane.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You want it. I’ve been thinking about
throwing it out.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Man - really - I can have it? Cool. I could
be a Ninja Darth Vader fighter with one of these - protect my mom from
the evil super.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: But first you’ll have to fight off the evil
— whatever this is.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Could be the super - go for cover.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Virgil - it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: En garde.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Jennie?! Jennie.. God, I’m sorry - c’mon in
- this is my friend Ethan - what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You want to tell me what we’re doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: That’s him. That’s our Father.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I can’t - I can’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I thought your eyes were better.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No. I - I don’t want to see him. My eyes
aren’t good enough - not yet - he won’t understand. It won’t be
enough.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: He’s our father. He heard about the
operation and he’s asked to see you. Look here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: GODDAMIT Jennie - I don’t want to see him -
I don’t even know why you brought me here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil?… Virgil?!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m here. I forget about the lights
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look - about this party tonight - it’s no big
deal - maybe we should just…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s your partner’s birthday. We should go -
besides you wanted me to meet your friends, right?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Glass of wine? Red - white?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Which is the red?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - here let me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No! Sorry - I mean - I’m almost there - I
think I got it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Dammit. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Trust me - you’re not the first - or
probably the last. Let me get a cloth.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Thanks</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I hope you’re driving.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: OK. He’s coming up the stairs. Everybody
get ready - kill the lights.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What - what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s for the surprise - they turned off the
lights.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Surprise - yeah.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Is he OK?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Here ya go Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Cheers, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil–over here!!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Maybe he’s blind again.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Don’t even think it. C’mon - I want the both of
you to meet him - he’ll never find us here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - I’m sorry - I went to get Duncan.
Duncan - Virgil. And this is Betsy.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Hey Virgil good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Heard a lot about you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Heyyy! Yeah. Good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Sorry - things still get a little cockeyed
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Few more of these and I’ll be the same.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Lemme get Kevin - my man - he’ll top you up.
KE-VIN!!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Nothing. It’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Amy, in Atlanta tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Duncan - I told you…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I spoke to Falk and he…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Amy said you had great hands.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: She did, did she.</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: You know my father was blind for several
years, he had cataracts as well.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Really. I’m surprised I don’t know him. It’s
a club you know.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Kevin - Duncan here the birthday man - could
use himself a drink. Kevin here tells me he’s black - did you know that
- I mean look at him - look at me - isn’t that the damnedest thing. He’s
black.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll get you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What’s that look?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What look?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’ve never seen your face that way before.
It’s.. .weird. What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>betsy</strong>: Come on Duncan - let’s dance - move those old
bones.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What the hell it’s my birthday – nice to
meet you Virgil - see you at the opening.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Opening?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The lobby we designed. Virgil - you can’t…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I feel like Rip Van Winkle. I’ve woken up
from a thirty year sleep - and the world’s passed me by.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s just dancing. Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No-no-no-no. It’s not the Goddamn dancing. I
wanted to come here tonight - show you I could “fit” in. Like the big
boys do. Big seeing boys. Yes. Well, I don’t. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s just going to take time. You weren’t
ready. We shouldn’t have come.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No - I - me, shouldn’t have come. You want
me to see - but you know what - you know what - shit - I don’t belong in
the wonderful world of seeing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil � look �.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No, I won’t. I’m tired of looking. Fuck
looking and the horse it came in on.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh my God, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah, I’m just fine. Take me home.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Didn’t want to wake you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You’re going.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ll only be a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What - we’re not working - your eyes - what’s
not working?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I get up every morning - I look in the
mirror - and I stare at a total stranger. I stare and I stare - and no
matter how hard I look - I don’t see Virgil there anywhere. And the more
I look at you…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What? You don’t see me?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I saw you better when I was blind.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, you’re not blind any more. I’m sorry if
that disappoints you. I’ve got a plane to catch. I’m going to go before
we say things we don’t mean.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: But we already cut those trees down.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You want to join us.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No - no - I’ll wait for you out here - when
you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Virgil</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’ll be done in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’d think he would have told us. I mean those
trees were in the photos.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: We’ll just have to win him over tomorrow.
Let me buy you a drink - get those creative juices going.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Aw - no - I really…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: C’mon - listen, they’re playing our
song.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Mack the Knife was our song?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: OK - I’m just about done here - I got a
place for you - relax those eyes a bit.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You want to know the truth – God’s honest
truth? Seeing’s been the shits.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You got to be kidding me son. You can say
that - sitting here in these prime viewing seats. Forget fixing your
eyes - we’re going to get your head examined.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m serious. I was better off blind. People
don’t have these expectations of you you can’t live up to. You’re blind
- fine - they deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Didn’t get what you expected did you?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: When I was blind - I had an image of what
everything was, up here… now - it’s all different - not at all what I’d
expected - not what I’d hoped for.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Virgil, let me explain something here. When
you were blind - you dealt with things one at a time - sequentially
right? A wall led to a door to a tree to a car. That’s how you got to
what you wanted - right. Seeing people - for better or worse - deal with
everything all at once - taking in the whole picture - which sometimes
confuses the hell out of what they want. Virgil, my advice after three
beers - don’t be afraid to take in the whole picture - just don’t lose
sight of what you want.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What I want is to make it work with Amy.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: And what does she have to say</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: She just wants me to see.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: It’s that important is it?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You know what I learned a long time ago.
Seeing girls like seeing guys. I’m not going to let her down.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: See - not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It’s nice to dance together again.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You remember…?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: First time we danced - Connecticut. We watched
the leaves turn - so much to see - I’d love to go back.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: So would I. What happened to us Amy? You’re
so intent on fixing everything - why’d you give up on us?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I learned some things can’t be fixed. We got
married for all the wrong reasons. I don’t think I fell in love with you
as much as I fell in love with architecture.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I never fell in love with architecture - but
I know I fell in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Now - that’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It used to work.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Amy? - what’s going on - what time is
it?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s wrong? This was’ a mistake - a big
mistake. Go back to sleep - you’ve got an important meeting
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’ve got? - hold on here - you’re not
bailing out on me - I need you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: For the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Of course for the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: To be a babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Can’t we for once be adults - face the fact
that we’ve just made a colossal error?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Fine - this was stupid, there - happy? - but
goddamit Amy - I still care about you. Where do you actuallv think any
of this is going to lead with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t know - but the one good thing to come
of this mess tonight - I know I want to find out.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hi</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Whatcha doing?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s the craziest thing. You start back over
there - focus on a building. And when you walk towards it - it changes -
each step makes it look different. I started out just looking for the
horizon.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You can’t see it from here - too many
buildings.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: But it’s still there - even though you can’t
see it - right? You gotta have faith it’s there. Things exist beyond
what I can see - I just have to take it on faith.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You have so many looks?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Wait - no - this isn’t your fault - I’m the
one’s been a shit. You’re too hard on yourself - expect too much of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil �</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Let me say this. Every day of my life - I’ve
wished for just one thing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: To see.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: To be whole. For just one month. For just
one day or one minute. For one goddamned half a second. And not just to
be able to run, or ride a bike, or drive a car. But for once not to have
a bruise from bumping into something or to stand in a room and have to
ask “is anyone here” and here that dead silence, knowing someone is
there. Not to have food on my sweater, or have to put my finger in my
glass to know when it’s full. I just want to be whole. I went to see my
father the other day.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I couldn’t face him. I felt like I was
letting him down. I feel like I’m letting you down.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No �</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No, listen. I gave up years ago - I’m not
going to give up now. Amy - that day I met you - for the first time in
my life I felt someone needed me as much as I needed them. I don’t want
you to give up on me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Besides I couldn’t leave you - I owe too
much in back rent.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Up until the operation five weeks ago -
Virgil had been a touch person - someone who’s vocabulary, whole
sensibility, his picture of the world was based on tactile – non-visual
terms.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: But - now - as a sighted person - by focusing
singlemindedly on his goal, Virgil has a new found ability to understand
his own physical relationship to objects in his life around him…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Distance, size, shape - perspective - now all
have profound meaning to him…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: This is an extraordinary achievement and
advancement for medical science and a tribute to Virgil’s determination
to see.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen - Virgil Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Since this may be one of our last sessions -
are there any questions?</p>
<p><strong>voice in the dark</strong>: Mr. Anderson - is there something
you were surprised to see for the first time - something that looked
quite different than you thought?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Breasts. No, really. Don’t get me wrong - I
love them - they just weren’t what I expected.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What about your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Whose did you think I was talking about?</p>
<p><strong>another voice in the dark</strong>: Now that you’re fully
seeing - what are you looking forward to most?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Not having to do these sessions. No -
actually - being independent.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Can you read yet?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No, but…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Will you ever be able to?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If you can’t read - will you ever be able to
drive?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well how can you say…</p>
<p><strong>familiar voice</strong>: Virgil. After so many years of
darkness - describe what it is to actually see.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re here.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The Atlanta project - I thought it went
away.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Duncan did some song and dance - Falk’s coming
to the lobby opening tomorrow - see our work.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I see it Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Your world. What you do. The plans - the
work the ideas. The molding. For the first time I really see what you do
- and not just up here… but in here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tonight is your night something special I want
to show you</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s the Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State
Building, Chrysler building just over there…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy, look at me.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This face - this is everything. It’s all
I’ve ever wanted to see. You have so many looks. What do all those looks
mean?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well. Let’s see. This… … is sad. This…is
frustrated. This… is tired. This.. is confused. This.. is happy. And
this… … is what in love looks like.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This look - this look I love.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - it’s raining.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So - eight o’clock tonight.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Eight o’clock - building opening - I haven’t
forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>overweight man</strong>: Hey, Virgil - I’m the one supposed
to fall asleep here.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yes - sorry.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Daphne - I need to see Dr. Aaron - right
away. It’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What you just did?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It means - the machine is only registering
sparks of activity - retinal sparks - followed by nothing. How long has
this been going on?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I don’t know - first I thought I was tired -
some blurs - occasional cloudiness but it’s been getting worse. Today
I’m getting complete blackouts.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Your retinal function is down ten percent.
I’m afraid - your retinal disease seems to have returned.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You’re afraid. What does that mean - I
thought you corrected it. You told me I was a ‘seeing person’.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Now, you’ve every right to be upset. Maybe
you didn’t have the blood vessels to supply enough oxygen to the
retinas. - Possibly some trauma - there are so many variables… to be
honest, I don’t know. I wish to God I did.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: OK. You’re the expert. Tell me - what do we
do now - how do we repair this?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Virgil. I – I wish there was a nice way to
say this.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No - there is no nice way to say it is
there. No nice way to let the man know it’s all over - that.. he’s going
blind again!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Virgil, I understand what…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No you don’t! Don’t ever say that. You’ll
never understand. Ever!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Hard to say. Month - few weeks - Days.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: God, what do I tell Amy? What do I tell
her?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You look good. Hey - how do I look?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I need some answers. Why’d you leave?
Because I’m blind - or because I quit trying to see?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: To the point - I like that - something you
got from me.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Cut the bullshit - “dad”. I don’t hear from
you for over twenty years - then you find out I can see and all of a
sudden you show up?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hey. Virge - can we talk about this later,
huh…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No, not later. Now! Was my blindness so
wrong that made you tear our family apart.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Every morning I woke up and looked at you
and saw my own failures. If I couldn’t get my own son to see then…What
difference does any of this make - you can see now - hell, I knew you
could.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m going blind again.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The doctor told me today. You’re the first
person I’ve told. I wanted to come see you before it was completely
gone.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry the building doesn’t open until
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I know. I’m Virgil Anderson…with Roswell
Tremont. We did the lobby. I’m here to check some details for
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Oh, okay, sure Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You want to see that the thing work?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Thing? What thing?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: This thing</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You nervous?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - not a bit. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Really. Not too flashy? I’m going to
change.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: This is an important night for you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But you know what’s most important… That you’re
going to be there to see it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy, it’s good - very good. I’m proud of
you. I love the detail - planted pots in the corners, the moldings… It’s
got genuine lines.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look around - do you see it?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Our rain.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Your rain.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Hey Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Still working on that hand shake you’ll get
it don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Congratulations - the place looks great.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Thanks - here’s the genius though - I just
get the gigs. Can I steal her away Falks’ over there and I can’t tell if
he’s impressed with our work or just has gas from the pate.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Go - do your thing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ll be right back. There’s food and drinks
down on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Quite a party. Love the detail of the
building.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Sometimes the detail doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Ray. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Aaron called me. He was worried. I’ve been
trying to find you - Amy’s office told me you were here. It’s bad?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s almost gone. Last few days have been
pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Obviously Amy doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s going to break her heart. This is her
big night - I didn’t want to ruin it. Thought I could pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You can’t avoid this forever.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I know So Ray? Is it better to have seen and
lost than never to have seen at all?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I thought it was loved and lost.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Dr. Webster - this is a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Virgil invited me - wanted to show you off
I think. The place is terrific - he’s got every right to be proud.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thank-you. I need Virgil for a moment -
schmoozing time.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Shmooze away.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Thanks Ray. I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil - I’d like you to meet Jack Falk and his
wife Donna up from Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Amy tells us you were blind.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That’s OK - nice to see someone so
honest.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: Amy tells us you’re her inspiration. Any help
you can give us with our project?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m a little biased but I kind of liked
Amy’s original design.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: But could we do better.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: We could do better, Mr. Falk - a lot
better.</p>
<p><strong>falk</strong>: Good, I like that attitude. Let’s keep trying
for perfection.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s right - that’s why I’ve got Virgil.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You wanna walk - I feel like some air.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: See what we see? Sure.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Can I take your arm - eyes a little
tired.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You really made the place come alive with
that fountain.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thank-you. You know I’ve been thinking - you’re
doing so great now - and if we get this new design job we’d have some
extra money - I think we should go on a big seeing celebration.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: A seeing celebration?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah, maybe in a couple of months. I looked
into Egypt - we could see the pyramids - we could see it together for
the first time. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You know - there is something I’d like to
see.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Of course, anything.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: The Rangers play tomorrow. Season’ll be over
before we know it - could be our last chance.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The Rangers. Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This is amazing - isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Should we find our seats. Looks like the game’s
already started.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah - I - I’ll follow you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I love the stadium the way it’s structure…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy - the game…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Right - the game.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He scored, he scored - you see that - it was
amazing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What? That was good right?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yeah - it was great - I was just…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The puffy thing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil, what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Just having a bad eye day. A lot to take
in.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tell me. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Nothing. I see almost nothing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s OK for you to cry.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, no - I’m not going to cry. Solve the
problem. We made it through one operation - we’ll make it through
another. We won’t give up. We’ll get this right - we just need to…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I saw Dr. Aaron. There’s nothing they can
do.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Then we’ll find another Doctor. There’s got to
be someone else. We’ll find something that works.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Don’t you get it - I can’t go through this
again.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So just like that - we just forget it - give
up? Why the hell haven’t you told me what was going on?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Because of this!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What this?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You! Not letting it go - thinking there’s a
solution. Goddamit, I’m not design flaw in your fucking work that you
can just change to make work Or throw away because it doesn’t meet your
expectations. Let’s face it - it’s over!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil, give it time, you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No! I won’t! This conversation is
ended!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do you mean leaving - you’re leaving this
apartment - you’re leaving New York - you’re leaving me?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So you’re big sister can take care of you -
feed you TV dinners for of your life.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m not going to go through this bullshit
again.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Is that what this has all been to you -
bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Yes!! Who the hell were we fooling? I’m
blind - I’m not meant to see - I don’t belong here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: God damn right you’re blind. You want to live
in your own little world - this perfect world that your sister built for
you - where no one can touch you … where no one can reach you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Do you know the reason why I remembered the
cotton candy all those years? Because I went to the game with my father.
And it’s the only good thing I can remember about him. The rest is him
pushing me to be something I’m not - then turning his back on me the
minute his plans fail.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I am not turning my back on you. You want me to
give up on you - you love the self pity.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I don’t want you to give up on ME. But you
won’t give up on me seeing.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Because there must be other options.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virgil!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Is anything broken?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No - no bones are broken.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: It’s finished - can’t you see that! We both
didn’t get what we wanted.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I never meant to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: When you asked me to come here - did you
ever think this wasn’t going to work - that for one minute I may not be
able to see. Did you ever think it would be OK to have a relationship
with a blind man?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: There’s my answer.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Sophie!?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Let me look at you. You’re so beautiful..
yes.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Mom and dad.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Everything’s as you left it. Nothing’s
changed.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Jen - I’m pretty tired - I’d like to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: flickering a moment.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I picked up some things at the store -
T-shirts, I’m sure you’re out, some socks…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Jennie, what’s at the end of Main
Street?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Well - I think it’s Vivian’s little
stationery…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Beyond all the stores - past firehouse. What
happens when this is no more Main Street?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Well - there’s nothing really - you know
that. ~</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No! You told me that’s all there was. That’s
wrong. There’s a helluva lot out there.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: I told you what you needed to know.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: What was within my reach.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: What more do vou want?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Isn’t there anything more that vou want?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Is this about our father - he called told
me…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: No. This isn’t about him. Jennie - you’ve
spent your whole life as blind as I was. The world doesn’t stop within
our reach.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Virgil, please. This is your home. Stop
thinking about what’s out there - things that will never matter to you.
You’re safe here where everyone…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Where everyone what!?</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Knows you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Can protect me?! Jennie, this place was a
wonderful safe haven for me growing up. I know that. And I can only
imagine what you gave up to keep this world for me. I thank you and love
you from the bottom of my soul. But now I want to give you your life
back.</p>
<p><strong>jennie</strong>: Virgil, I - I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: You can</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: I’m reaching out, Jennie.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Amy - you in there.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I knew keeping this key would come in handy
one day. What a mess - what happened?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It broke - I’m trying to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: So - guess what?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m not in the mood for games.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: We got it. The goddamned Atlanta mall - we
got it!! Now - pull yourself out of this slump - I want you to fly down
this week to…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: What are you ta1king about? What’s the
problem here?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The problem?! Everything. Nothing is right
thank-you very much.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You know what the problem is - you’re the
problem - you met a blind guy you thought was cool and spent the first
two months trying to change him.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Not even close. Let me tell you something -
you can’t change people to solve you. You tried to do it with me - you
tried to do it with Virgil. You ever think some of the things you try to
fix - ain’t broke.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Virg …….</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hey Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hi, Ethan. Sorry - I thought…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He’s not coming back is he?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No - he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Whatcha doin’?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Cleaning up a mess - going to start over.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Growing up blind - I had two dreams. One was
to see. The other - to play for the New York Rangers.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: After the ‘miracle’ of my short period of
sight - I realize - I’d rather play for the Rangers. It’s not that it
was so awful - I saw many things - some good, some back some that I’m
already forgetting.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: But I realized that our eyes aren’t what
make us see. We only live in darkness when we don’t look - look at what
is genuine about ourselves - genuine about others - you don’t need eyes
for that.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Did I miss?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: By a mile.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Ray told me you were living in town - said I
could find you here. I rushed, didn’t I? Fourteen steps to the tree and
I made us smash right into it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: We tried.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I finished the sculpture. I’d love you to see
it.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Figure of speech.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Figure of speech. Virgil - when I first met you
- you saw more than any sighted person I’ve ever known. I didn’t mean to
take that away from you.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Amy. I saw … I actually saw the horizon. You
did that for me. It’s out there. You showed me you just have to reach
for it..</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You want to walk?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: See what we see?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah. Just see what we see.</p>
