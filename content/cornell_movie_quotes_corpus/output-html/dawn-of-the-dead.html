<h1 id="dawn-of-the-dead">dawn-of-the-dead</h1>
<p><strong>the dead</strong>: by George A. Romero</p>
<p><strong>happen.</strong>: Voice: YES, BUT THAT’S…</p>
<p><strong>we’ve gotta operate on what we do know!</strong>: 5 The room
is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others organise the stacks
of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip over cables and generally get
in each other’s way.</p>
<p><strong>to stay on air.</strong>: 7 Fran staggers over to the control
consoles. The technicians are at the end of their ropes.</p>
<p><strong>roll the rescue stations again.</strong>: Technicians: WE GOT
A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE</p>
<p><strong>sure, i’ll pull it outa my ass.</strong>: Fran focuses on the
monitors. She is incredulous… stunned by the madness which surrounds
her. She realises the hopelessness of the situation as she zeroes in on
the televised conversation.</p>
<p><strong>believe…</strong>: TV Man 2: DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE
RETURNING TO</p>
<p><strong>life?</strong>: TV Man 1: I’M NOT SO…</p>
<p><strong>life and attacking the living?</strong>: TV Man 1: I’M NOT SO
SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR!</p>
<p><strong>and it’s hard enough to believe…</strong>: TV Man 2: IT’S
FACT… IT’S FACT…</p>
<p><strong>forget all human dignity and…</strong>: TV Man 2: HUMAN DIG…
YOU CAN’T…</p>
<p><strong>the moral bull shit they want to hear!</strong>: TV Man 1:
YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN</p>
<p><strong>who aren’t ready for that doctor foster…</strong>: 10 A great
cry of assent goes up from the studio floor. Doctor Foster is flustered
and frustrated. The stage hands and cameramen are all screaming at him,
swearing and ridiculing. We notice Police guards, armed, at the studio
doors. They control the traffic in and out of the big room.</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s receiving on the emergencies…</strong>: Fran pulls
herself away from the monitors as the argument rages on screen.</p>
<p><strong>say again…can’t hear you…</strong>: Fran: RESCUE
STATIONS?</p>
<p><strong>on the air for the last twelve hours.</strong>: Fran: THESE
ARE RESCUE STATIONS. WE CAN’T SEND</p>
<p><strong>people to inoperative…</strong>: Charlie:</p>
<p><strong>say again, new hope…</strong>: Charlie makes more notes and
hands them to Fran. Still listening on the receiver, he speaks to the
woman again.</p>
<p><strong>too. good luck.</strong>: Fran snatches up the sheets and
moves across the room.</p>
<p><strong>i’ll have the new ones ready as soon as i can.</strong>:
Technician: WE’RE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE</p>
<p><strong>closed down. i’m gonna kill the old list.</strong>: 14 Fran
moves toward another control room. An armed officer stops her. A young
man rushing through with copy intercedes.</p>
<p><strong>she’s alright. let her through.</strong>: The officer
reluctantly steps aside.</p>
<p><strong>you got a badge…any kind of badge…</strong>: Fran: IT’S
REALLY GOING CRAZY.</p>
<p><strong>large!</strong>: 18 Another outraged cry goes up from the
stagehands and observers. Doctor Foster tries to out-scream the
cries…</p>
<p><strong>what does it take to make people see?</strong>: 19 Fran moves
into the large studio area where the broadcasters argue. The commotion
is maddening. Fran stares for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>body.</strong>: Another outburst in the studio.</p>
<p><strong>too late…they are multiplying too rapidly…</strong>: 21 Fran
moves through the crowded room of emotional people and finally reaches
another emergency radio installation. Skip and Dusty are trying to
listen to their receivers. They jot notes.</p>
<p><strong>we’re losin’ this war.</strong>: Fran: YEAH, BUT NOT TO THE
ENEMY.</p>
<p><strong>we’re blowin’ it ourselves.</strong>: She gives the rest of
her coffee to the two men.</p>
<p><strong>doctor, and i, for one, don’t blame them.</strong>: TV Man 2:
EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED</p>
<p><strong>the people it kills get up and kill!</strong>: 23 Handing the
list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter typist, Fran rushes
back toward the control room.</p>
<p><strong>out to stations that have closed down?</strong>: Givens:
WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY</p>
<p><strong>minute people won’t watch us. they’ll tune out.</strong>:
Fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>we’re on the air.</strong>: Fran is about to say something in
anger, but before she can, one of the technicians, having overheard
Givens, gets up from the control panel and starts to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>get on that console…lucas…we’re on the air!</strong>: Lucas:
ANYBODY NEED A RIDE!</p>
<p><strong>men…lucas…get back on this console…</strong>: A frantic
hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People rush in and out,
the floor director’s voice can be heard over a talk back system…</p>
<p><strong>we’re losing picture…</strong>: Givens: OFFICER…STOP THOSE
MEN…</p>
<p><strong>the money…we’re staying on the air…</strong>: Fran moves
slowly off toward the studio.</p>
<p><strong>mr. berman. that’s what keeps them going.</strong>: 31 Fran
stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the shadows of the
studio. People rush past her, some leaving the studio in disgust.</p>
<p><strong>it wouldn’t have come to this!</strong>: Foster wipes his
sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his tie away from his tight
collar, and pops the shirt button open. He is desperate now, shivering
with anger and frustration.</p>
<p><strong>no matter how safely protected or well stocked…</strong>: A
murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional crescendo. Foster
tries to talk over the noise…</p>
<p><strong>the city…</strong>: 33 Technicians abandon their posts. A few
others jump in to take their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman
whips off his headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its
liquid head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster
continues to speak.</p>
<p><strong>guard for organised disposition…</strong>: 35 Suddenly a man
darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up quickly behind Fran.</p>
<p><strong>we’re getting out.</strong>: Fran:</p>
<p><strong>stephen…i don’t believe this…what…</strong>: Steve: WE’RE
GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER.</p>
<p><strong>lookin’ for ya.</strong>: Stephen is gone in a flash. Fran
nervously looks back at the cameraman. The argument still rages between
Foster and Berman. The cameraman, without taking his eye from the
viewfinder, speaks to Francine quietly and slowly.</p>
<p><strong>our responsibility… is finished, i’m afraid.</strong>: 36 It
is dusk, and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly quiet. We see
several large buildings. They are part of a low-income housing project,
and their lack of grace is evident. They stand like tombstones as the
first stars appear in the navy blue sky.</p>
<p><strong>have the building surrounded…</strong>: The electronically
amplified voice echoes through the concrete caverns between the
buildings of the project. There are only a few windows which glow with
lights from inside. At the sound of the bullhorn, the lights all blink
out one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>building…dumb little bastard!</strong>: Sergeant: LOOKS LIKE
THEY’RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US.</p>
<p><strong>and neither do you!</strong>: 42 There is no sign of life in
the building. The great concrete slab is silhouetted silently against
the darkening sky.</p>
<p><strong>turn over your weapons and surrender…</strong>: Roger: THERE
ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU…</p>
<p><strong>people…</strong>: Roger: YET.</p>
<p><strong>little puerto rican ass…so i can blow it off…</strong>: Roger
looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up violence in
Wooley.</p>
<p><strong>nigger asses right off…</strong>: Roger is greatly concerned.
He looks at one of the other men, a young, smoothed faced rookie. The
boy doesn’t know now to react. He is obviously nervous.</p>
<p><strong>go in.</strong>: The boy nods, grateful for a more human
contact.</p>
<p><strong>’em out. blow their asses!</strong>: Roger:</p>
<p><strong>you gonna be alright?</strong>: The boy nods in the
affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>my time!</strong>: 44 CRASH! Without warning, the metal door
to the fire stair bursts open and several figures rush out of the
darkness. Shots are fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the
skull of the young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a
pleading expression on his face.</p>
<p><strong>goddammit!</strong>: Sergeant:</p>
<p><strong>all units… full operation!</strong>: 46 On the roof, Roger
struggles under the dead weight of the young man. He tries to free
himself and his weapons. Shots ring out.</p>
<p><strong>come and get ’em…</strong>: He fires again and again, even
though the skirmish is winding down.</p>
<p><strong>masks for gas…masks for gas.</strong>: 49 Tear gas canisters
crash through windows and the halls are filled with clouds of gas.
Civilians trying to escape, are choked as they attempt to shoot their
way out.</p>
<p><strong>down the stairs.</strong>: Roger and Wooley and the men in
their unit, snap on their bizarre looking gas masks.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. 2: wooley’s gone ape shit, man…</strong>: Roger:
WOOLEY!</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. 4: shoot for the head.</strong>: Woman: NO! NO!
MIGUEL…DIOS MIO…MIGUELITO…</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. 3: grab her…get her out of there…</strong>: The
Zombie clutches at the woman. It bites at her neck…her arm. She screams
with terror. She tries to pull away, but the creature holds her. It
bites again. A Trooper comes up from behind and tries to wrestle the
creature away. Another Trooper grabs the woman and tries to free her.
She is screaming insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off
her arm.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. 3: stand clear…for chrissake…stand clear!</strong>:
57 In the apartment, the female Zombie lunges at the third Trooper and
the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and, with all his
might, throws her against the wall. She advances again. Roger raises his
gun, She is just about to reach him. He fires. The bullet drops her.</p>
<p><strong>i didn’t see how he died.</strong>: Roger slings his rifle,
so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his gun. He removes his gas mask. He
is Black.</p>
<p><strong>i just mean ’cause of…</strong>: Voice: YEAH. I KNOW.</p>
<p><strong>i could run.</strong>: Roger stares up at the grim faced
Black.</p>
<p><strong>runnin’ out with it. as’t me t’come.</strong>: The Black man
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>please to let me pass…</strong>: The voice weakens into a low
wheezing cough. The figure slumps and sits on the steps, clinging to the
railing. It is an old Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican
Parish.</p>
<p><strong>floor…to find my sister…</strong>: Roger: THEY’RE TAKIN’
EVERYONE DOWN…THEY PROBABLY</p>
<p><strong>brought her down…come one…</strong>: Priest: MY SISTER…SHE IS
DEAD…THEY TELL ME…</p>
<p><strong>the dead they do not bring down.</strong>: Roger and the
Black Trooper shoot glances at one another.</p>
<p><strong>up their dead…to no one!</strong>: The Priest goes into a
coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger wants to help in some way.</p>
<p><strong>you find them…</strong>: The Troopers are shocked. The Priest
struggles to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>now…you do what you will…</strong>: The old man starts up the
stairs. Roger moves to help him, but the big Black man stops him. The
Priest weaves up through the gas mist, coughing.</p>
<p><strong>think…they be stronger than you…</strong>: The old man’s
voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears in the cloud…</p>
<p><strong>stop the killing…or we lose the war…</strong>: 63 In the
basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at the boards
which are nailed over the entrance to the storage area.</p>
<p><strong>do it?</strong>: Black: ’CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE’S</p>
<p><strong>respect in dying.</strong>: The big man fires into the head
of another squirming Zombie.</p>
<p><strong>it’s tough to get used to it.</strong>: He pulls her quickly
along. They have to actually step over the civilian corpse. Fran freezes
again. She can’t bring herself to walk over the body. Steve lets go of
her hand and checking the tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he
moves quickly back to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the
civilian corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has
been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood still runs.
The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he tugs the hose over the
corpse and moves to the helicopter with Fran following.</p>
<p><strong>spits out at ya.</strong>: The woman takes over and Stephen
trots away toward the guard shed. The propeller blades still spin. They
make an eerie, whispering sound as they pass over Fran’s head. She can
hear the lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting
docks. She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>operator dead…post abandoned…</strong>: 73 Back on the fuel
dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian corpse. A shadow moves
nearby, making is aware of a presence other than Fran’s.</p>
<p><strong>about a minute and a half.</strong>: Officer 3, the Skipper,
pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve spins out through the open
doorway. He looks up the dock and sees the vehicle which is just turning
onto the pier which is almost a mile long.</p>
<p><strong>after the launches…we had nothing to do with…</strong>:
Officer 3:</p>
<p><strong>steve andrews.</strong>: Steve:</p>
<p><strong>right…that’s me…i’m steve andrew…</strong>: Officer 3: NO
SHIT.</p>
<p><strong>we’d get a lot further in this bird, skipper.</strong>: 83
Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers.</p>
<p><strong>how many will that thing hold?</strong>: Officer 4: HEY, MAN,
I AIN’T GOIN’ NOWHERE IN NOTHIN’ I</p>
<p><strong>can’t driver myself!</strong>: 86 Officer 2 has returned to
the van and is carrying out another carton rushing back to the
launch.</p>
<p><strong>we’re stuck. stay with the launch!</strong>: Officer 1: GET A
LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD!</p>
<p><strong>j.a.s. traffic bird…</strong>: The man starts to grin with
knowing. He suddenly feels in more control.</p>
<p><strong>gasoline.</strong>: 96 Roger: WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS?</p>
<p><strong>they’re tryin’ to get out, too.</strong>: Officer 3: IT’D BE
CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN’ AT ONE</p>
<p><strong>another, now wouldn’t it?</strong>: 98 Roger: SURE WOULD.</p>
<p><strong>times is tense.</strong>: 100 The policemen start to unload
crates and cartons from their Van. The big Black Trooper pulls a few
supplies from out of the squad car and carries them toward the
helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>who’s he?</strong>: Roger: HIS NAME’S PETER. HE’S
ALRIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>report about the dock bein’ knocked out.</strong>: 104 They
reach the cockpit. Fran climbs in and crouches on the floor in the rear
of the bubble.</p>
<p><strong>the islands.</strong>: Steve: WHAT ISLANDS?</p>
<p><strong>some brothers.</strong>: 109 The whirlybird cuts through the
dark night sky. It flies over open country now, moving West. Some time
has passed.</p>
<p><strong>but we catch up to each other once in a while.</strong>: Fran
doesn’t quite know how to respond.</p>
<p><strong>he your man now?</strong>: Fran is taken off guard. She
smiles slightly.</p>
<p><strong>you know where you are?</strong>: Steve: I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
WE ARE.</p>
<p><strong>landin’ in.</strong>: 113 In the morning light, several fires
can be seen on the ground, where buildings are burning.</p>
<p><strong>better off away from the big cities.</strong>: 117 A little
country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun. There is no sign of
life. A few private planes dot the area, but the tower is empty. The
J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside the tower windows.</p>
<p><strong>guess they all hit the pumps and took off.</strong>: Steve:
TO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO?</p>
<p><strong>couldn’t wait. gone to erie - jack foster.</strong>: There
are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee cup from the
machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet door just across the
room. It is moving slightly. It is locked, but it bangs against the
lock…once…twice…more regularly than if caused by the wind drafts.</p>
<p><strong>they can’t catch you.</strong>: She hesitates. The Zombies
draw closer.</p>
<p><strong>we can handle them!</strong>: Fran charges up the little
grade. She runs to the right of the creatures and they move in her
direction, arms outstretched. As she draws near to the dead things, she
hesitates again in fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in
front is within a few feet of the woman.</p>
<p><strong>isn’t it?</strong>: Stephen looks up at the tall man,
shivering. Then Peter lowers his weapon and extends his hand, helping
Stephen up onto his feet.</p>
<p><strong>get out alive.</strong>: Peter: WE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY
PLACE ALIVE.</p>
<p><strong>we almost didn’t get out of here.</strong>: Roger: WE’RE
GETTIN’ OUTA HERE FINE.</p>
<p><strong>things we can handle ’em easy.</strong>: Peter: YEAH, WELL IT
WASN’T “THOSE THINGS” THAT</p>
<p><strong>nearly blew me away!</strong>: Stephen turns around and is
about to say something angrily. Roger stops him by speaking
urgently.</p>
<p><strong>be more little private airports upstate.</strong>: Steve:</p>
<p><strong>fuel stations there, private and state.</strong>: Roger:
PROB’LY STILL MANNED. WE DON’T NEED THOSE</p>
<p><strong>hassles either.</strong>: Steve: THEY’RE JUST OUT AFTER
SCAVENGERS…LOOTERS…</p>
<p><strong>i got j.a.s. id. so does fran.</strong>: Peter RIGHT. AND
WE’RE OUT HERE DOIN’ TRAFFIC REPORTS?</p>
<p><strong>what we are. and we gotta find our own way!</strong>: There
is a long silence. The engine drones, but the helicopter still sits on
the ground. The men look at each other. Peter takes a long slug of
water.</p>
<p><strong>you need to sleep.</strong>: 156 We see a wide shot of the
little airfield. The J.A.S. chopper sits on the ground for a moment,
it’s props spinning. The, with a surge of power, it lifts off and flies
away. The dry earth swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper
over the wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>floor.</strong>: Peter: THE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE
BOTH</p>
<p><strong>floors.</strong>: Roger: IF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP…</p>
<p><strong>why do they come here?</strong>: Steve:</p>
<p><strong>their lives.</strong>: 168 Below, the Zombies which are in
sight wander aimlessly over the plaza. Some try the gates but cannot
budge them. One wanders out of the single open shop, it is a female. The
shop is an appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster
idly behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the floor
loudly.</p>
<p><strong>a lot of philly’s still lit. could be nuclear.</strong>: 171
Roger: HEY LOOK AT THIS!</p>
<p><strong>what the hell is this?</strong>: Fran and Stephen peer down
into the darkness. Peter pulls a flashlight from his utility belt. He
has stayed in full uniform all the while, where Roger has stripped off
all but his ammunition belt and pistol holster.</p>
<p><strong>cut.</strong>: 186 A great barricade of food cartons has been
stacked against the stairway door.</p>
<p><strong>we could use, brother.</strong>: Roger: I KNOW IT.</p>
<p><strong>it’s a big place. i think we would out-run ’em.</strong>:
Roger: HIT AND RUN.</p>
<p><strong>we gotta at least check it out.</strong>: 188 Roger checks
his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door where he begins to remove
the barricade of cartons. Peter still sits, checking his own guns.</p>
<p><strong>from…look what happened at the airport…</strong>: Peter: THE
ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS!</p>
<p><strong>we could outfight those dummies blindfolded.</strong>: Fran:
STEPHEN… Peter:</p>
<p><strong>leave him be. we’re goin’ ourselves.</strong>: The big
Trooper bends over snatching up Stephen’s rifle. He snaps off the safety
and slams a shell into the chamber. He hands it to the woman. Peter:
THAT’S READY TO SHOOT. BE CAREFUL. Fran holds the gun gingerly. Peter:
THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES REAL EASY, BUT THE WEAPON’LL</p>
<p><strong>kick you good when it fires. be ready for that.</strong>:
Fran WAIT A MINUTE, I…</p>
<p><strong>out to the parkin’ lot. you can pick us up there.</strong>:
Fran just stares up at the big man, with desperation in her eyes. She
has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers’ decision is made.</p>
<p><strong>the fire.</strong>: 191 Two landings below, there is almost
no light. Roger clicks on his flashlight and shines the beam around. He
is in a very small concrete space. The stairs go down no further. There
is only one door. Peter eases down the steps behind. Roger: THIS IS THE
ONLY WAY UP THERE.192 We see the other side of the metal door. It stands
in another cement walled space, which also seems small from our angle,
but it is fully lit. The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously
step out. As the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the
end of a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open
supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet. Both rooms
are filled with cleaning supplies.193 Down along the hall can be seen a
dozen or so doorways. Some doors are open, some are closed. Along the
opposite wall there is nothing. The far end of the hall, about a hundred
yards away, opens out onto the second story of the mall proper.194 The
men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor. They try the
first two doors, which are locked. The third is wide open. 195 Roger
ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is a large
administrative office, with rows of desks which are fully equipped for a
staff of secretaries and accountants.196 The next room has a closed
door, but it is unlocked. Peter swings the door open and silently jumps
into the room. This is a much more spartan area, with two metal desks
and a few chairs. There are several phones. It is a maintenance office.
On one wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling
over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of the space
is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and an entire series of
master controls all keyed by a number code to another map of the mall
showing electrical installations. On the wall behind Peter is a large
blackboard and two metal cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of
tools, manual and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie
units and there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,
also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings and Roger
steps up behind him. Roger: THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197 Back in the
hallway, Roger’s hand tries another doorknob and throws the door open.
This opens onto beautifully plush offices, obviously the executive
headquarters. The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to
door in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting Peter
at each room. One office is more elegant than the next, with the latest
in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198 The Troopers finally
reach a room on which both the interior and corridor doors are closed
and locked. The brass nameplate on the interior door reads C.J. Porter -
President.199 Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They
move into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the hall,
and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They can only see a
small section.200 The balcony on their side is railed off against the
open drop down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see
the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can be seen.
They are both gated and shut. 201 The two realise what dangers might
face them in the mall proper. They look at each other and move forward,
each clinging to opposite walls in the corridor.202 As they reach the
mall proper they slowly and carefully peer around their respective
corners.</p>
<p><strong>must be like loading docks…but what are these?</strong>: The
man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within the big
Department Store they are studying. Roger: WASHROOMS…EQUIPMENT…I DUNNO.
Roger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still stares
at the map. Peter: I GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES. Roger: HOW ABOUT A
LITTLE MUSIC? Peter: WHAT?210 The big Black moves up behind his partner.
One of the controls on the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a
master switch which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR
EXHIBITS and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens
of master switches which are in the off mode. Peter: POWER SWITCHES.
Roger: THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE. Peter: HIT ’EM ALL.
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.</p>
<p><strong>stephen!</strong>: 213 Steve, still lying on the floor
against the escape pyramid, slowly awakens.214 Down on the first floor
of the big mall, things begin to work. The automobile turntable starts
spinning; the great escalators move up and sown. Two of the living dead,
caught just starting up two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the
mechanical steps begin moving.</p>
<p><strong>they’re maniacs.</strong>: 221 The Troopers step over the
corpse. The second Zombie, the arm less female, is walking toward them.
This time Roger fires his weapon. The creature falls in a heap. Roger:
WHATD’YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT? Peter: YOU GAME? Roger nods and
the two men run down the hall toward the mall. Their rifles poised, they
are like commandos on an important mission.</p>
<p><strong>stephen please!</strong>: Steve: IT’S ALRIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>on the side…</strong>: The big man moves to the far side of
the gate. The same key fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is
riding the escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to
shoot when something catches his eye.</p>
<p><strong>get what we can.</strong>: Roger: THERE’S NO WAY THIS IS
GONNA HAPPEN…</p>
<p><strong>you dumb ass suckers…you dumb…you are dumb!</strong>: 276
Upstairs, the doors to the elevator glide open again and Roger moves
through the second floor aisles stealthily.277 Stephen takes the
maintenance manual and leaves the office. He walks down the interior
corridor and opens the door to the exterior corridor. As the door opens,
the Zombies attack. The Zombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the
door on Zombie 13’s arm. Stephen then runs back down the interior
corridor.</p>
<p><strong>good…enough to move the wagon.</strong>: The creatures slam
against the first floor gate, but it holds securely. Peter stares at the
beasts as he lowers his talk unit. He backs slowly away into the depths
of the store.</p>
<p><strong>is flyboy, let’s get him on our side.</strong>: Roger moves
to the second lock. More gunfire.</p>
<p><strong>you just cover me good, you hear?</strong>: Roger moves to
the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to the handles of the
barrow.</p>
<p><strong>right up with you.</strong>: 316 Steve is on the verge of
panic.</p>
<p><strong>through ’em. we gotta lead ’em away from here!</strong>: 318
Steve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to run past
the Zombies.</p>
<p><strong>how ’bout it?</strong>: Stephen laughs some more, nervously
at first, then whole- Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud:</p>
<p><strong>stayin’ up on the balcony.</strong>: Roger: YEAH, BUT WE CAN
HANDLE THAT. WE CAN BREAK THROUGH.</p>
<p><strong>follow us on up. it’s no good.</strong>: Roger: WE CAN SURE
AS HELL OUT RUN ’EM…LOAD UP WHAT</p>
<p><strong>we can and get outta here.</strong>: Peter: I’M THINKIN’
MAYBE WE GOT A GOOD THING GOIN’ HERE. MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T BE IN SUCH A
HURRY TO LEAVE. Roger: OH, MAN… Peter: IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE
WITHOUT THEM CATCHIN’ ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE.</p>
<p><strong>at least long enough to catch a breath.</strong>: CHECK OUT
THE RADIO. SEE WHAT’S HAPPENIN’… Roger: MAN, I DON’T KNOW… Steve:
THERE’S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP</p>
<p><strong>of the stores.</strong>: The Troopers look at the young
pilot, almost surprised to hear him speak. He has been quiet up until
now.</p>
<p><strong>if it’s some kind of access. i saw it on a map.</strong>:
Peter: UPSTAIRS. LET’S GO.</p>
<p><strong>saw on the chart.</strong>: Steve: WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE
LOCKED?</p>
<p><strong>driver and somethin’ to stand on for in here.</strong>: 341
Roger: I KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE. GET ONE OF THOSE</p>
<p><strong>tables.</strong>: Roger ducks off down an aisle and Steve
moves to the nearby furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp
table. The elevator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he
has to hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already climbing
out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to hold the doors
open and goes to get another. This time he gets a larger coffee table
and sets it under the opening in the car and puts the smaller table on
top. He climbs up and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors
close again.342 In the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevator
mechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight. Peter:
IT’S ALRIGHT…WE CAN GET IT OFF.</p>
<p><strong>you found it flyboy.</strong>: Even though he speaks softly,
Peter’s voice has an eerie, echoing sound in the narrow shaft.</p>
<p><strong>this is it. come on.</strong>: 351 Fran struggles with the
carton. She gets it against the door finally and moves to haul
another.</p>
<p><strong>the desk…gimme a hand.</strong>: The two Troopers grab the
desk and slide it away from the President’s corpse. The action causes
the chair to spin slightly and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the
action.</p>
<p><strong>come on…you got it.</strong>: Peter runs with the cart the
last few yards. As he gets to the doorway, Roger breaks up the
steps.</p>
<p><strong>you ok, frannie? hey…</strong>: The woman is incoherent. She
is clutching at her stomach.</p>
<p><strong>hurt, hun? did ya hurt yourself? frannie…</strong>: 375
Downstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can see the
mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger hurriedly carry
the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the floor and retreat back
into the fire stairs. Peter holds open the door slightly and watches the
corridor for a moment. Convinced they’ve not been seen, he closes the
door.</p>
<p><strong>of stuff…all kinds of stuff…</strong>: In the background the
two Troopers bring their load of supplies into the big room and deposit
them near the TV. Then they go downstairs for another load.</p>
<p><strong>is perfect. we got it made in here…frannie.</strong>: The
woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching.</p>
<p><strong>that means they’re sending.</strong>: Roger snaps on the
large, battery powered radio. He rolls the dial getting nothing but
static. Finally, he hears a signal and tunes it in. A badly modulated
voice is droning through the interference. It sounds like a war
correspondent sending a signal from very far away.</p>
<p><strong>and new york city…</strong>: Roger: PHILLY…</p>
<p><strong>what we were able to do today.</strong>: 379 Peter’s eyes
suddenly blink open. None of the rest of his body moves, the others do
not realise he is awake. The big man stares at Stephen, who is getting
emotionally excited about their exploits as a team.</p>
<p><strong>never touched us…not really.</strong>: Peter: THEY TOUCHED US
GOOD, FLYBOY. WE’RE LUCKY</p>
<p><strong>to get out with our asses. you don’t forget that!</strong>:
380 The other men look at Peter. The radio drones on with more disaster
reports.</p>
<p><strong>suckers…and you get eaten! how you like that?</strong>: Peter
speaks in a low, unemotional tone. Stephen is transfixed.</p>
<p><strong>you know about the emperor’s reward?</strong>: 381 We see
Fran’s face. She is listening. There is no answer audible. A tear rolls
down the woman’s cheek. The radio drones.</p>
<p><strong>we’d never find anything like this…</strong>: Fran: I GUESS
NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?</p>
<p><strong>can be a prison.</strong>: She leans in to him, making a
final plea.</p>
<p><strong>going.</strong>: Steve: WE CAN’T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN
THAT LITTLE BIRD.</p>
<p><strong>what we need. what we need to survive.</strong>: 382 Cut to a
close up of Peter’s face. His eyes pop open.</p>
<p><strong>give us away if somebody comes mess’ around.</strong>: Roger:
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY</p>
<p><strong>thing sat there for eight days.</strong>: Peter: SOMEBODY
FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO</p>
<p><strong>how much its worth.</strong>: 383 Fran ducks back onto her
blanket. She disgustedly lights another cigarette. Steve sits next to
her again.</p>
<p><strong>we got everything we need right here!</strong>: Stephen curls
up with his head on the rolled blanket.</p>
<p><strong>set up house.</strong>: She stares off across the barren
room. His hands continues to move under her blouse.</p>
<p><strong>each other.</strong>: 385 We see the mall balcony now.
Zombies wander past the stores. Some move down the stationary stairs
onto the main concourse. Below.</p>
<p><strong>flesh…</strong>: 386 At the mall entrances, some creatures
drift out into the night. Others still enter the enormous building.
There are not as many as there were in the afternoon, but there are
certainly enough to be threatening.</p>
<p><strong>remembered behaviours from…from normal life.</strong>: 387
Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department store.
It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted eyes of the
mannequins within the store seem to watch the Zombies. The gate rattles
but does not budge.</p>
<p><strong>this manner.</strong>: 388 Fran’s eyes pop open the voice has
awakened her. She has been asleep on the blanket.</p>
<p><strong>instinct…</strong>: The woman looks around. Morning sunlight
is spilling in through the skylights above. She sits up and peers into
the next area of the room. The men are gone. The television is playing.
On the tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room
reading the report.</p>
<p><strong>must be destroyed on sight….</strong>: 390 Fran sees that the
barricade of cartons is still in place at the fire stairs door. She
looks up. The skylight above the pyramid is open. She realises that the
men are on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>of ‘em around yet this mornin’.</strong>: The big trooper
looks down to the parking lot below.</p>
<p><strong>don’t have my pots and pans.</strong>: There is a bitterness
in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses the tension. Peter just straps
on his equipment.</p>
<p><strong>than you’d treat another guy.</strong>: Steve: HEY, FRANNIE,
COME ON…</p>
<p><strong>four of us, ok?</strong>: Steve: JESUS, FRAN…</p>
<p><strong>learn to fight.</strong>: The big man starts back up the
pyramid. Roger moves to follow him.</p>
<p><strong>how to fly that helicopter.</strong>: Stephen is shocked.
Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>out of here.</strong>: Stephen doesn’t know what to say. He
looks at the woman, then up at the other men.</p>
<p><strong>it.</strong>: Peter and Roger disappear through the skylight.
Stephen stands still. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to
his side.</p>
<p><strong>this thing…</strong>: Roger: I GREW UP ON ONE OF THESE, LET’S
GO.</p>
<p><strong>we got a lot to do…roger…</strong>: 439 There is no response
from the other truck. Peter is about to open his door and step out when
suddenly Roger sits up again. The engine of the truck roars. He seems to
have calmed down some. He looks across at Peter.</p>
<p><strong>other truck.</strong>: Peter brings his vehicle to a
screeching halt.</p>
<p><strong>better screw your fuckin’ head on, baby!</strong>: Roger:
YEAH, YEAH…I’M O.K. LET’S GO.</p>
<p><strong>your life, your playin’ with mine!</strong>: The two men
stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled somewhat out of his
emotional rush.</p>
<p><strong>alright, now are you straight?</strong>: Roger: YEAH.</p>
<p><strong>i won’t be able to walk on this at all if we wait.</strong>:
Peter: CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?</p>
<p><strong>you can afford to lose me…</strong>: The big Black man stares
at his friend for a moment. Then he drives on to the warehouse escorted
by the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>inside. that’s a long haul between those entrances.</strong>:
Steve: WELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARES…OR MAYBE</p>
<p><strong>some of those propane jobs.</strong>: Peter: THE GUNS ARE
FIRST. GUNS AND AMMUNITION.</p>
<p><strong>chasin’ us around in here.</strong>: The Zombie crashes all
its might against the metal cage. Stephen startles.</p>
<p><strong>gun…is the sucker with the bread to buy it.</strong>: 496 The
cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged forehead of the
Zombie, which is thrashing against the roll gates. The sight gives up a
sense of the super-weapon’s lethal accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>we comin’…and we ready!</strong>: 500 With a swell in the
music, the band of all four humans charges out of the Maintenance
corridor and makes a break for the Department Store. They all wear new
double holsters containing hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his
shoulder and another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with
other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big gardening cart
which Peter earlier used to carry the first supply load out of the
store. Peter runs, pushing the cart before him.</p>
<p><strong>by these right here…</strong>: Steve: IT’S A LONG HAUL DOWN
TO THE ENTRANCE.</p>
<p><strong>those doors!</strong>: Fran: WE’LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT’S
TOO RISKY.</p>
<p><strong>close the gate…close the gate…</strong>: 518 Steve grabs the
lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is still inside the store
with one of the torches.</p>
<p><strong>through.</strong>: Steve: CAN’T THEY SMASH THE GLASS?</p>
<p><strong>no leverage under the truck.. gimme the alarms…</strong>: 545
Steve rummages in his back pack. Produces two portable battery operated
burglar alarms. Peter activates the units, stands them against the base
of the now locked doors. As he crouches near the glass, creatures
outside go into a frenzy clawing at the glass doors. They cannot get
in.</p>
<p><strong>they can’t get in…</strong>: 546 The creatures moving slowly
down the concourse are now getting close to the action.</p>
<p><strong>get it all locked off and we’re goin’ on a hunt!</strong>:
The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the
telescope.</p>
<p><strong>plumbing…</strong>: Steve: WHY CAN’T WE JUST BOARD UP THE
STAIRWAY. HELL,</p>
<p><strong>they can’t even get through a stack of cartons.</strong>:
Peter: I’M NOT JUST WORRYIN’ ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR</p>
<p><strong>stairway exists.</strong>: They look back at the map.</p>
<p><strong>the wall.</strong>: 561 The men sit huddled. The large
storage area is filled with mounds of supplies brought up from the mall
stores, but the stuff all sits around in disarray.</p>
<p><strong>unit…</strong>: 565 Steve looks at Peter. The big trooper
speaks softly.</p>
<p><strong>hours.</strong>: 566 Fran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams
from behind the cartons.</p>
<p><strong>perfect.</strong>: Peter grabs the can and pries it open
quickly with a screw driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and
smears some onto the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is
a perfect match.</p>
<p><strong>it off?</strong>: Fran: NO…</p>
<p><strong>here.</strong>: The man doesn’t move. Fran reaches up, taking
his hand. She clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry.</p>
<p><strong>clean up, brother.</strong>: Flies buzz about the staring
faces of the dead things on the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>nine…locked at four…keeps the bankers honest.</strong>: The
wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open.</p>
<p><strong>pyramids…a burial chamber.</strong>: Peter: THAT’S EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS, NOW…..</p>
<p><strong>they wanna be in here!</strong>: The noise at the entrance
continues eerily. Fran starts to be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>room in hell.</strong>: Steve: WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>more room in hell…the dead will walk the earth.</strong>: 591
Roger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks sunken with
an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to hold him. His leg
is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which was also bitten, is wrapped
but oozing.</p>
<p><strong>you’ll take care of me…when i go…</strong>: Peter: I
WILL.</p>
<p><strong>like that…</strong>: The man’s eyes are terrified. He looks
this way and that at the walls, the ceiling, at Peter…He can’t
focus…</p>
<p><strong>gonna try…not to come back…</strong>: 603 Later, the moon
shines down through the skylight in the living area. A sturdy ladder has
now replaced the pyramid of cartons up to the open hatch.</p>
<p><strong>ratios.</strong>: Comm.: YOU MEAN…THEIR NEED VERSUS…</p>
<p><strong>imbalance and they’re incapable of understanding…</strong>:
Comm.: WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?</p>
<p><strong>counter measures or we’re all…</strong>: Comm.: COUNTER
MEASURES?</p>
<p><strong>sumption…we have to control it for them!</strong>: Comm.:
YOU’RE SUGGESTING THAT WE HELP THEM?</p>
<p><strong>stations…and any…private citizens…</strong>: The camera pulls
off Peter’s face. We see that his rifle is stretched across his lap. The
TV drones on from the other room.</p>
<p><strong>to prevent revival…</strong>: We see now what Peter is
staring at. On the floor, twenty feet away lies the corpse of Roger.
It’s face is covered with a blanket. It lies very still.</p>
<p><strong>for distribution among the infected society…</strong>: The
shouts of anger continue.</p>
<p><strong>society…</strong>: Suddenly the dead Roger’s foot seems to
move under the blanket. Peter’s eyes pick up the movement immediately.
His hands tighten on his weapon.</p>
<p><strong>dignity of the human body…</strong>: Roger’s arms seem to
move, in slight twitching motions…</p>
<p><strong>and buried in consecrated grounds…</strong>: The commotion in
the studio reaches a fever pitch.</p>
<p><strong>rational…logical…tactical! tactical!</strong>: 612 Steve:
THEY’RE CRAZY…THEY’RE CRAZY…</p>
<p><strong>why don’t you give it up?</strong>: Steve: THEY MIGHT COME
BACK ON.</p>
<p><strong>for tonight?</strong>: Voice: TONIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>on the roof.</strong>: 634 Fran steps to the doorway
attracted by the signal. Peter sits at the radio, not knowing whether to
send. Steve listens.</p>
<p><strong>gettin’ in there to stock up?</strong>: Peter listens
intently, trying to read the voice’s inflections.</p>
<p><strong>three of us. couldn’t ya use three more guns?</strong>:
Peter: RAIDERS.</p>
<p><strong>no chance.</strong>: The little puppy scrambles up to Fran’s
feet, seeking attention. She picks the little dog up in her arms.</p>
<p><strong>real bad! we don’t like people who don’t share.</strong>:
Instantly Peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster.</p>
<p><strong>stores are open?</strong>: Steve: I DUNNO…SEVERAL OF ’EM…</p>
<p><strong>we’re gonna shut off the gates.</strong>: Fran: STEPHEN!</p>
<p><strong>they’ll never find us up here.</strong>: The man disappears
through the stairway door. Fran drops the puppy which goes running after
the men floppily.</p>
<p><strong>then we go in with the van…</strong>: 645 The other bikes
ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two bikers scramble aboard
through the side doors. One of the women jumps into the driver’s seat
and revs the engine.</p>
<p><strong>downstairs first…</strong>: Steve: OK…</p>
<p><strong>for us…</strong>: The man sits at the wheel, revving the
engine. Ghouls at windows.</p>
<p><strong>sniper.</strong>: The leader rolls out. Others follow. Peter
fires and drops a raider, his bikes flying into the approaching
Zombies.</p>
<p><strong>up the stairs.</strong>: 679 Peter moves to another spot on
the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>the shaft…i’m comin.</strong>: Peter starts to crawl through
the ducts.</p>
<p><strong>wait…we’ll just wait a while…</strong>: 731 The mall stands
silent in the blue haze of impending dawn.</p>
<p><strong>down there and let them…let them…</strong>: The puppy
suddenly growls. It charges between Peter’s feet and runs floppily down
the steps.</p>
<p><strong>you know that? i really don’t.</strong>: 743 Suddenly, the
door flies open and the creatures lumber into the living space. Peter
stares at them. He smiles slightly. The creatures advance, led by
Stephen.</p>
