<h1 id="romeo-and-juliet">romeo-and-juliet</h1>
<p><strong>anchor woman</strong>: Two households both alike in dignity
in fair Verona, Where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new
mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean, From forth the
fatal loins of these two foes, A pair of star crossed lovers take their
life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows doth with their death, Bury
their parents strife. The fearful passage of their death marked love,
And the continuance of their parents rage, Which but their children’s
end not could remove, Is now the two hours traffic of our stage.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: A dog of the house of Capulet moves me!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: The quarrel is between our masters.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: And us their men.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. And I am
a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of Flesh! Here comes of the
house of Capulet!</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Quarrel, I will back thee.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: I will bite my thumb at them; which is a
disgrace to them, if they bear it.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: I do bite my thumb, sir!</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Is the law on our side, if I say ay?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you,
sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Do you quarrel, sir?</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Quarrel sir! no, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: If you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as
good a man as you.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: No better?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Uh? Uh?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Here comes our kinsmen say better!</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Yes, sir better.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: You lie. Draw, if you be men.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Part, fools! you know not what you do. Put
up your swords.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: What, art thou drawn among these heartless
hinds? Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Peace. Peace? I hate the word, As I hate
hell, all Montagues, and thee.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Bang Bang! Bang Bang!</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Bang.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Give me my long sword, ho!</p>
<p><strong>lady montague</strong>: Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a
foe.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Throw
your mistemper’d weapons to the ground! On pain of torture, from those
bloody hands Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground! Three civil
brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have
thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets, If ever you disturb our
streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</p>
<p><strong>lady montague</strong>: O, where is Romeo? saw you him
to-day? Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Madam, underneath a grove of sycamore so
early walking did I see your son.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</p>
<p><strong>lady montague</strong>: Away from the light steals home my
heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his
windows, locks far daylight out And makes himself an artificial
night.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Black and portentous must this humour
prove, Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: So please you, step aside; I’ll know his
grievance, or be much denied.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: Come, madam, let’s away.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O
anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity.
Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Good-morrow, cousin.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Is the day so young?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: But new struck cuz.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my
father that went hence so fast?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s
hours?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not having that, which, having, makes them
short.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: In love?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Out–</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Of love?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Out of her favour, where I am in love.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O
me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here’s
much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O
loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness!
Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead–
Dost thou not laugh?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: No, cuz, I rather weep.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good heart, at what?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: At thy good heart’s oppression.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Farewell, my cuz.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me
so, you do me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: But Montague is bound as well as I, In
penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep
the peace.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Of honourable reckoning are you both; And
pity ’tis you lived at odds so long. But now, my lord, what say you to
my suit?</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: But saying o’er what I have said before: My
child is yet a stranger in the world; Let two more summers wither in
their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Younger than she are happy mothers made.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: And too soon marr’d are those so early
made. This night I hold an old accustom’d feast, At my poor house look
to behold this night Fresh female buds that make dark heaven light. Hear
all, all see, Come, go with me.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Tell me in sadness, who is that you
love.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: I aim’d so near, when I supposed you
loved.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: A right good marks-man! And she’s fair I
love.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest
hit.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
With Cupid’s arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open
her lap to saint-seducing gold:</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Then she hath sworn that she will still
live chaste?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: She hath, and in that sparing makes huge
waste.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Be ruled by me, forget to think of
her.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Teach me how I should forget to think.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine
other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp’d and tormented. Good
day, good fellow.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Now I’ll tell you without asking the
great rich Capulet holds an old accustomed feast–A fair assembly.
Signior Placentio and his lovely daughters. The lady widow of Vitravio;
and her lovely nieces Rosaline.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest, With all the admired
beauties of Verona:</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: If you be not of the house of Montague
come and crush a cup of wine.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Go thither; and, with untainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think
thy swan a crow.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But
to rejoice in splendor of mine own.</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: J U L I E T ! ! ! ! Juliet! Juliet!
Juliet! Nurse. Nurse, where’s my daughter? call her forth to me.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet!
Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Madam, I am here. What is your will?</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk
in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our
counsel. Nurse, Thou know’st my daughter’s of a pretty age.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I
nursed.</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: By my count, I was your mother much
upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant
Paris seeks you for his love.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all
the world- -why, he’s a man of wax.</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: Verona’s summer hath not such a
flower.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Nay, he’s a flower; in faith, a very
flower.</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: This night you shall behold him at our
feast; Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face, And find delight writ
there with beauty’s pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth
possess, By having him, making yourself no less.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Nay, bigger; women grow by men.</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’
love?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent to give
strength to make it fly.</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Madam, the guests are come.</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy
days.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Young hearts run free. Never be caught up,
caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you
dance.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing
shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: You are a lover; borrow Cupid’s wings, And
soar with them above a common bound.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Too great oppression for a tender
thing.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too
rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: If love be rough with you, be rough with
love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Every man betake him to his legs.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: But ’tis no wit to go.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Why, may one ask?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I dream’d a dream to-night.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: And so did I.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well, what was yours?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: That dreamers often lie.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: In bed asleep, while they do dream things
true.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with
you. She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than
an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of
little atomies Over men’s noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an
empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state
she gallops night by night Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream
of love; O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she
driveth o’er a soldier’s neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign
throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps
again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them
and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This
is she–This is she!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk’st of
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: True, I talk of dreams, Which are the
children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is
as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who
wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger’d, puffs
away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: This wind, you talk of, blows us from
ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some
consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful
date With this night’s revels and expire the term Of a despised life
closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He,
that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Your drugs are quick.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Ahhh! I have seen the day That I could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear, Such as would please.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam, your mother calls. Come, lets
away.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Will you now deny to dance?</p>
<p><strong>lady capulet</strong>: A man young lady, such a man.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer
and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To
strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you
so?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a
Montague, our foe.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Young Romeo is it?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: ’Tis he.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let
him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house
do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: I’ll not endure him.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: He shall be endured</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Uncle, ’tis a shame.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall:
go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Did my heart love till now? forswear it,
sight! For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: If I profane with my unworthiest hand This
holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too
much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that
pilgrims’ hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers
too?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in
prayer.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what
hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Saints do not move, though grant for
prayers’ sake.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I
take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Then have my lips the sin that they have
took.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You kiss by the book.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
Come lets away.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Is she a Capulet?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: His name is Romeo, and he’s a Montague; The
only son of your great enemy.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Away, begone; the sport is at the
best.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: My only love sprung from my only hate! Too
early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is
to me, That I must love a loathed enemy.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitterous gall.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Romeo! Romeo!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I
conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes, By her high forehead and her
scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O,
Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good
night: I’ll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and
Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is
already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair
than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is
but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is
my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Ay me!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn
my love, And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at
this?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: ’Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art
thyself, though not a Montague. What’s Montague? it is nor hand, nor
foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be
some other name! What’s in a name? that which we call a rose By any
other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo
call’d, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O
Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take
all myself.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I take thee at thy word.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Neither, fair maid, if either thee
dislike.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: How camest thou hither, tell me, and
wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place
death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee
here.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: With love’s light wings did I o’er-perch
these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do
that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: If they do see thee, they will murder
thee.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I have night’s cloak to hide me from their
eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better
ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Thou know’st the mask of night is on my
face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou
hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know
thou wilt say ‘Ay,’ And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear’st, Thou
mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it
faithfully:</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That
tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops–</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant
moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well what shall I swear by?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear
by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I’ll believe
thee.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: If my heart’s dear love–</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have
no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too
sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say
‘It lightens.’ Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer’s ripening
breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What satisfaction canst thou have
to-night?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for
mine.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I gave thee mine before thou didst request
it!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Three words, dear Romeo, and good night
indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage,
send me word to-morrow, By one that I’ll procure to come to thee, Where
and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy
foot I’ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I uh, by and by I come–But if thou mean’st
not well, I do beseech thee–</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: By and by, I come: – To cease thy strief,
and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: So thrive my soul–</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: A thousand times good night! Exit, above</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: A thousand times the worse, to want thy
light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love
from love, toward school with heavy looks.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Romeo! At what o’clock to-morrow Shall I
send to thee?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: By the hour of nine.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I will not fail: ’tis twenty year till
then.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Good night, good night! Parting is such
sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: O, mighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought
so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth
give, nor aught so good, but strain’d from that fair use revolts from
true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being
misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant
rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for
this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays
all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in
man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is
predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good marrow, father!</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Benedicite! What early tounge so
sweet saludeth me?</p>
<p><strong>altar boys</strong>: Good marrow, Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good marrow.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Young son, it argues a distemper’d
head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I
hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The last is true; the sweeter rest was
mine.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: God pardon sin, was thou with
Rosaline!?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot
that name, and that name’s woe.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: That’s my good son: but where hast
thou been</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I have been feasting with mine enemy, where
on a sudden one hath wounded me, that’s by me wounded; both our
remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Be plain, good son, and homely in
thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set,
on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange
of vow. I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to
marry us today.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Holy Saint Francis, what a change
is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken?
Young men’s love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: For doting; not for loving, pupil
mine.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: O, she new well. Thy love read by
rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one
respect I’ll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to
turn you household rachor to pure love.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Wisely and slow; they stumble that
run fast.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came
he not home to-night?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Not to his father’s; I spoke with his
man.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that
Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath
sent a letter to his father’s house.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A challenge, on my life.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Romeo will answer it?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Any man that can write may answer a
letter.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Nay, he will answer the letter’s master,
how he dares, being dared.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead;
stabbed with a white wench’s black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy’s
butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Why, what is Tybalt?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: More than prince of cats. He is the
courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song,
keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two,
and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a
duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first
and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Here comes Romeo. Romeo!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ho Ho, Capital Punks!</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Signior Romeo, bon jour! there’s a French
salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last
night.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did
I give you?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: The slip, son, the slip; can you not
conceive?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great;
and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: That’s as much as to say, such a case as
yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Meaning, to court’sy.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Thou hast most kindly hit it.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: A most courteous exposition.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Pink for flower.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Why, then is my pump well flowered.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art
thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Here’s goodly gear!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I desire some confidence with you.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! Romeo!
Romeo! Romeo! Will you come to your father’s? we’ll to dinner,
thither.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I will follow you.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: If ye should lead her into a fool’s paradise,
as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the
lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly
it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Bid her to come to confession this afternoon;
And there she shall at Father Laurence’ cell Be shrived and married.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how
my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
I pray thee, speak.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you
not see that I am out of breath?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: How art thou out of breath, when thou hast
breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or
bad? answer to that;</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Well, you have made a simple choice; you know
not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better
than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s; and for a hand, and a
foot, and a body,</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But all this did I know before. What says he
of our marriage? what of that?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
O, my back! Other’ other side,–O, my back.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and
a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a
virtuous,–Where is your mother?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest!
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?’</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do
your messages yourself.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Here’s such a coil! Come, what says
Romeo?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Have you got leave to go to confession
to-day?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Then hie you hence to Father Laurence’ cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: These violent delights have violent
ends. And in their triumph die; like fire and powder, which as they kiss
consume. The sweetest honey is loathsome in it’s own deliciousness.
Therefore love moderatley. Romeo, shall thank the daughter for us
both.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: I pray thee good Mercutio let’s retire.
The day is hot. the Capel’s are abroad, and if we meet we shall not
’scape a brawl, for in these hot day is the mad blood stirring.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of
these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his
sword upon the table and says, "God send me no need of thee." and by the
operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there
is no need.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Am I like Such a fellow?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any
in Verona.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: By my head here come the Capulets.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: By my heel, I care not.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word
with one of you?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: OH, and but one word with one of us?
Couple it with something. Make it a word and a…a blow.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: You shall find me apt enough to that, sir.
And you will give me occasion.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Could you not take some occasion without
giving?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Mercutio! Thou art consortest with
Romeo?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Consort? What does thou make us minstrels?
An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here’s my
fiddlestick. Here’s that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Either withdraw unto some private place,
or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze
on us.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them
gaze. I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Peace be with you sir, Here comes my
man.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: ROMEO! The love I bear thee can afford no
better term than this. Thou art a villain!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
doth much exuse the appertaning rage to such a greeting: villiain am I
none. Therefore farwell. I see thou Knowest me not.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Boy this shall not excuse the injuries that
thou has done me! Turn and Draw! Turn and draw! Turn and draw! Turn and
draw! Turn and draw!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I do protest I never injured thee, but love
thee better than thou cans’t devise. till thou shall know the reason of
my love. And so good Capulet who’s name I tender as dearly as mine own,
Be satisfied. Be satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou
art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: What wouldst thou have with me?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Good king of cat’s, nothing but one of
your nine lives.</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: I am for you.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Art thou hurt?</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a
scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Courage man, the hurt can not be much.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: ‘Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you
shall find me a grave man. A plague o’ both your houses. They have made
worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you
come between us? I was hurt under your arm.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I thought all for the best.</p>
<p><strong>mercutio</strong>: A Plague o’ both your houses.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: NO! Mercutio!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned
night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out
into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all
the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish
sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though
I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before
some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear
them.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Mercutio’s soul is but a little way above our
heads staying for thine to keep him company!</p>
<p><strong>tybalt</strong>: Thou, wretched boy shalt with him hence.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him!
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him! Either thou, or I, or
both, must go with him! I am Fortunes fool!</p>
<p><strong>captian prince</strong>: ROMEO! Away begone stand not amazed!
Away!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Tybalt!</p>
<p><strong>captian prince</strong>: Where are the vile beginners of this
fray? Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</p>
<p><strong>benvolio</strong>: Romeo, he cries aloud, Hold friends.
Tybalt her is slain. Romeo’s hand did slay. Romeo spoke him fair. could
not take truce with the unruly spleen of Tybalt, deaf to peace.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: It’s the kinsman to the Montague, affection
makes him false! I beg for justice which thou prince must give, Romeo
slew Tybalt! Romeo must not live!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio; Who now
the price of his dear blood doth owe?</p>
<p><strong>ted montague</strong>: Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s
friend; his fault concludes but what the law should end, the life of
Tybalt.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: And for that offense Immediately we do exile
him.</p>
<p><strong>ted montague</strong>: Noble Prince–</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; Nor
tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none. Let
Romeo hence in haste, Else when he is found that hour is his last&gt;
Romeo is banished!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile
hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say
Banishment.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and
thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be
patient, for the world is broad and wide.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: There is no world without Verona walls, hence
banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then
banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu’st my head
off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: O deadly sin, O rude
unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I come for my lady Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Where is my Lady’s lord?</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Romeo, come forth.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Nurse.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps,
and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: As if that name, Shot from the deadly level
of a gun did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand did murder her
kinsman.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: I thought thy disposition better
tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that
threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art
thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest
thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth
all three do meet in thee at once.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: How well my comfort is revived by this.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Hie you make haste! But look thou
stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua
where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage,
reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with
twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation.
Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Farewell.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O God. Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such
vile matter’s so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a
gorgeous palace.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: She’ll not come down tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: These times of woe afford no time to woo.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt
dearly.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: And so did I.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Well, we were born to die.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: I’ll know her mind early tomorrow, but
tonight she’s mewed up to her heaviness.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: I will makes a desperate tender of my
child’s love. I think she will be ruled in all respect by me; Nay, more,
I doubt it not. But what say you to Thursday?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: My lord, I… I would that Thursday were
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: A Thursday let it be then. Wife, you go to
Juliet ere you go to bed. Tell her, a Thursday she will be married to
this noble sir!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near
day.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It
is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I
have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet
wills it so. How is’t my soul? Let us talk it is not day.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away. O,
now be gone. More light and light it grows.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: More Light and light, more dark and dark our
woes.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Madam! Your lady mother is coming to your
chamber</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Ho, daughter are you up?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Then window, let day in and let life out. O,
think’st thou we shall ever meet again?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these
woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks
I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O
fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not
keep him long but send him back.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Thou hast a careful father, child: One who,
to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that
thou expects nor I looked not for.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Madam, in happy time what day is that?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The
gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,
shall make thee there a joyful bride.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What? Now. St. Peter’s Church, and Peter
too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Here comes your father, tell him so
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: How now, wife? Have you delivered to her
our decree?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Ay Sir! But she will none, she gives you
thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth
she not count her blest, unworthy as she is, that we have wrought so
worth a gentleman to be her bride?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Not proud you have, but thankful that you
have. Proud can I never be of what I hate!</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Thanks me no thanking, nor proud me no
prouds, But fettle your joints ’gainst Thursday next.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Hear me with patience.</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Fie, Fie, are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient
wretch.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: God in heaven bless her! You are to blame my
lord, to rate her so!</p>
<p><strong>capulet</strong>: Peace you mumbling fool! I tell thee
what-get thee to church o’ Thursday Or never after look me in the face
an you be mine, I give you to my friend. An you be not, hang, beg,
starve, die in the streets, Trust to it. Bethink you. I’ll not be
forsworn!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay
this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do
as thou wilt for I have done with thee.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: O God!–O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry
with this Paris. O, he’s a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in
this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your
first is dead–or ’twere as good he were as living here and you no use to
him.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Speakest thou from thy heart?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: And from my soul too. Else beshrew them
both.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Amen</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.
Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father
Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death. Now,
sir, her father counts it dangerous that she doth give her sorrow so
much sway, and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation
of her tears. Happily met, my lady, and my wife.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: That "may be," must be, love, on Thursday
next.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What must be, shall be.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Well, that’s a certain text.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Come you to make confession?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or
shall I come to you at evening mass?</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: My leisure serves me, pensive
daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: God shield I Should disturb devotion. Juliet,
on Thursday early will I rouse Ye, Till then, adieu, and keep this holy
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Tell me not, Father, that thou hearest of
this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: It strains me past the compass of
my wits.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do
thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I’ll help it
presently!</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: Hold Daughter!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Be not so long to speak I long to die.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: I do spy a kind of hope, Which
craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would
prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will
to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like
death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou
livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark
and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning
comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be
borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet
lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my
letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night
shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then
in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I’ll send my letters
to thy lord post haste to Mantua.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: What, daughter are you busy? Need you my
help?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: No, madam. We have culled such necessaries
as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be
left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure
you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has
need.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Farewell. God knows when we shall meet
again.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Romeo, I drink to thee.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: As the custom is, in all her best
array, bear her to church.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts
me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and
found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I
revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed
when but love’s shadow’s are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now,
Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my
lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill
if she be well.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: If she is well then nothing can be
ill. Her body rests in Capel’s monument, and her immortal part with the
angel’s lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill
news.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I
will hence tonight.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Have patience!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Leave Me!</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Your looks are pale and wild and do
import some misadventure.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters
to me from the priest? No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee
tonight. I will hence tonight.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Romeo is within Verona Wall’s.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Let me have a dram of poison, such some
speeding gear, as will disperse itself through all the veins, that the
life weary taker may fall dead</p>
<p><strong>crusty</strong>: Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona’s law
is death to any that utters them.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds
law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</p>
<p><strong>crusty</strong>: My poverty, but not my will consents.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</p>
<p><strong>crusty</strong>: Drink it off and, if you had the strength of
twenty men it would dispatch you straight.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Here is my gold. Worse poison to men’s souls,
than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: The letter was of dear import.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I could not send it nor get a messenger to
bring it thee.</p>
<p><strong>father lawrence</strong>: The neglecting it may do much
damage.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Live and be prosperous; and farewell good
fellow.</p>
<p><strong>balthasar</strong>: Then I’ll leave thee.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Tempt not a desperate man!</p>
<p><strong>captian prince</strong>: Hold! Hold!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O my love, my wife, Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath, hath no power yet upon thy beauty, thou art not
conquered. Beauty’s ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
and death’s pale flag is not advanced there. Ah, dear Juliet, why art
thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous
and keeps thee here in the dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I
still will stay thee. Here, oh, here will I set up my everlasting rest,
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
Eyes look your last, arms take your last embrace, and lips, O you the
doors to breath, seal with a righteous kiss. A dateless bargain, to
engrossing death.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Romeo. What’s here? Poison. Drunk all, and
left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily
some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Thus….. with a kiss…… I die.</p>
<p><strong>captian prince</strong>: See what a scourge is laid upon your
hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. And I, for
winking at your discords too, have lost a brace of kinsman. All are
Punished. ALL ARE PUNISHED!</p>
<p><strong>anchor woman</strong>: A glooming peace this morning with it
brings, the sun, for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have
more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned and some punished.
For never was a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her
Romeo.</p>
