<p><strong>images</strong>: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE
who knows he will never be rescued… TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse
door; through the screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the
news will be…</p>
<p><strong>images</strong>: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN… Now
we are the coffin as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG
WOMAN’S HAND.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: You’ll get used to him. Every Sunday morning
- rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Hi Barb. The house sold yesterday. I know, I
know, the market’s depressed. Anyway, I’m leaving the area. Some things
I have to do. Things I couldn’t do while you were here. Maybe you would
have approved. Hell, I know you wouldn’t have. I’ve tried everything and
I can’t seem to get their attention. But now they’ll learn how it feels
on the other side. Let’s hope it elevates their thinking.</p>
<p><strong>army m. p.</strong>: General Hummel, sir. It’s an honour. Is
the Colonel expecting you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Held better be. This is a security
inspection.</p>
<p><strong>army m. p.</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>colonel callahan</strong>: General Hummel! This is a
surprise!</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: That’s the idea, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. crisp</strong>: This is a security exercise, sir. We’ve
fully breached and infiltrated your compound. I’m afraid you and your
men are my prisoners, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. crisp</strong>: Sorry sir, you realise the importance of
these exercises.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Ten men who could have been terrorists are
out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound,
Colonel. Here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator. This
is not a tight ship. I would not want to be in your shoes in the
morning.</p>
<p>****: Son of a bitch…</p>
<p>****: You owe me five dollars, Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: I was told this was exciting work.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Patience, Marvin. It has its moments.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: Bosnian refugee camp? I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Half a million Serbians reside in the
U.S., Marvin. Serbians don’t like Bosnians. Read a newspaper. It’s good
for you. Hold out your hand.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: I’m okay. Really. Let’s do it-</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Coal miners use canaries, we use those.
Sorry guys.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: We have airlock, Bill. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william
Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood. Initiating exam of a
wooden crate. Suspicion of seran gas device inside.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning
agents, and… … old clothes.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: This is thrilling.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Careful, goddamn it Marvin!</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: What’s hap… what’s happening….?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: Don’t panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas
will clear. You’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’ve got some bad news and some really
bad news. The bad news is the gas is corrosive. It’s eating our
suits.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: What’s the really bad news.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber
and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: The acid’s eating… it’s eating my fucking
suit…</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Chill, Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lonner</strong>: Something’s blocking the pipes, Bill.
When in Christ’s name are they gonna give us a new building …</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine,
Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: You die, we all die, Bill. Inject
yourself, then diffuse it. Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Get that away from me. I hate
needles.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lonner</strong>: It’s coming, it’s coming …</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: Ten seconds, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE
FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus
Christ …</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: Three, two… the gas is clear!</p>
<p><strong>dr. ling</strong>: Next time use the atropine!</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I don’t like needles.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Every little dream I dream about you, Every
little song I sing about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, Wanna
keep you locked up at home …</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hey there.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Hey honey.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Wrote a new song. Wanna hear it?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Boy, somebody’s in a bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Yeah, somebody’s in a bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Better?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Much better. She sits with him. Puts her
arm around him.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What happened baby. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Had a close one.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You know how I feel about what you do.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Could we change the subject?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: That record company.in Nashville wants to
hear my demo tape.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Hey! Now there’s some good news.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You think I’m too… ethnic for country
music?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Carla Pestalozzi? No. Definitely not. You
could have posed for the Mona Lisa. Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to
you. I hope that’s a compliment. I could change my name. How ’bout Bobby
Sue Pestalozzi? Billy io Pestalozzi?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Stick with Carla.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Okay. How ’bout Carla Goodspeed? Six years,
Bill. We’ve lived together six years.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: We’ve talked about this, Carla, we’ve
talked it up, down, inside and out …</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Billy, this probably isn’t the best time …
Bill, I’m uhhh.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>park ranger joe</strong>: Alcatraz - “the Rock” - is the most
famous, and was the most feared, prison ever built. Here the inmates
were allowed one hour of daily exercise.</p>
<p><strong>female tourist</strong>: Is it really true no one
escaped?</p>
<p><strong>park ranger joe</strong>: True, madam. From 1936 until the
prison’s closing in 1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one’s
believed to have made it to shore - alive at least.</p>
<p><strong>park ranger joe</strong>: Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly;
Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells.</p>
<p><strong>park ranger joe</strong>: Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S.
Park Service cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz -
temporarily of course.</p>
<p><strong>int. alcatraz - u.s. park rangers office - afternoon two park
rangers</strong>: and a SECRETARY look up.</p>
<p><strong>alcatraz park ranger</strong>: You’re not supposed to leave
the tour, guys. Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. crisp</strong>: Big problem.</p>
<p><strong>park ranger joe</strong>: Don’t want to be locked up,
fellahs?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Not today. You go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>park ranger joe</strong>: I don’t think so hah hah.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>tourists</strong>: Hey, what are you doing… ? – wait a
minute, what’s going on… ?</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: General Hummel: Captains Frye and
Darrow.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Deploy as planned, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Hello Ladies and Gentlemen. You are my
prisoners. I have no intention of harming you. You will be fed
regularly. That is all you need to know for now.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Can it wait till morning,
Agent Wood, I’m going to hear Bruce Springsteen …</p>
<p><strong>agent wood</strong>: In that?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Christ, the concert’s for
the Prince of Wales or somebody …</p>
<p><strong>agent wood</strong>: I really think you should take this call
personally.</p>
<p>****: First: I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on Alcatraz
Island. Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the media or
there will not be eighty. Second: fifteen guided rockets armed with V.X.
poison, are currently aimed at the population of San Francisco. I will
call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Wait. Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Mary Jane, get the Pentagon!
Call the San Francisco office. It seems Alcatraz was just re-opened.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: At ease, Gentlemen. It is traditional for me
to meet with my officers before an operation. The heart performs one
thing, the legs another, the brain another - all better function
together or the body becomes ill, is prone to disease. Major Baxter,
Gunny Crisp and I have been on the front lines since ‘Nam.’ Captain
Hendrix was my adjutant in the Gulf. Get a haircut, Pete, you’re lookin’
like a beatnik. You and your men are new to me.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: Would the General like a recitation of
our service records?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I’m well aware of your service records,
Captain, they are excellent. I want to be clear on why you - why all of
us are here. You both stand to profit from this.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: Profit is not my motive, sir. I am
here to redress a wrong.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Yes, sir, and to learn some people a
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: This country has places where wrongs are
redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law. In the
military, they are called Courts Martial. This country has places where
lessons a-re leaned. They are called schools. Am I confusing you?</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Well, sir, frankly … EL I see that I
am ’</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: The only accurate term for what we are doing
here is treason. Plain and simple. An insurrection against a government
to which we have sworn allegiance. Everyone in this room must understand
that.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: The question is what kind of traitor are we.
Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson? I have posed that
question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear. Have
all of you?</p>
<p><strong>hummels’ officers</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this
country and not return. All of you can live with that?</p>
<p><strong>other officers</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Well, I cannot. So, regardless of what
happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange
surprised glances.</p>
<p><strong>captain hendrix</strong>: But General, you’ll be
prosecuted.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Yes, Captain. And I plan on conducting my
own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of
“Perry Mason.” Take your posts, gentlemen. Semper fi.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Last night Hummel and eleven
marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen
V.X. rockets. It wasn’t discovered until the shift change this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Here he is in Vietnam - I think a
Major at the time.</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada,
Panama, Desert Storm. Three purple hearts… two silver stars and… the
Congressional Medal of… Jesus. The man is a hero.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: A legend. During Tet he held off a
brigade of V.C. single-handedly. Saved his whole company. Hence the
nickname “gunfighter.”</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: What was this book Hummel
wrote on Vietnam? Anybody read it?</p>
<p><strong>rayden sinclair</strong>: No. Give me the skinny.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: The “skinny,” Mr. Sinclair, is that
the U.S. should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of
Vietnam and stopped wasting American lives. I happen to share General
Hummells view.</p>
<p><strong>naval attache</strong>: General, it’s him. The call connects
to a phone on the table.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Frank, this is Albert Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Hello Al. Howlre Judy and the kids?</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: They’re fine. I’m with General
Peterson, F.B.I. Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security
Advisor Lindstrom, and C.I.A. Director Amway. You’ve got a lot of people
worried, Frank. Can you help us out?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I’ll come straight to the point, General
Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my
various commands. Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China …</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Who is that. Identify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: White House Chief of Staff
Sinclair, General.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: How old are you, white House Chief of Staff
Sinclair.</p>
<p><strong>rayden sinclair</strong>: I’m thirty-three.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by
your ninth birthday I had led over two hundred incursions into China and
personally killed that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape
over Mr. sinclair’s fat, ignorant mouth. He has shit for brains and he
is wasting my time.</p>
<p><strong>naval attache</strong>: The President calling from
Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Continue Frank.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Eighteen others died in covert, illegal
operations in Chile and El Salvador. Remember the Gulf War. Those pretty
“smart bomb” pictures on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets. Ten were
left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let’s not even
mention Mogadishu, gentlemen. No benefits were paid to their families;
no medals conferred. These men died for their country and they weren’t
even given a coddamn military burial. This situation will not stand: you
will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman “Red Sea Trading
Company” account to an account I designate. From these funds,
reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83
marines, families. The rest of the money will pay for my outfit’s
expenses. Am I clear?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Except for the Red Sea
Trading Company. What is that?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Identify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: F.B.I. Director Womack,
General.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: You’ll be particularly interested: It’s a
slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms
sales.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Frank, Jesus, this is classified
information.</p>
<p><strong>womack</strong>: Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: If you want the money back, you’ll have to
tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came
from. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: General, I’ve just spoken to the
President and he is clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with
you and we do not care if …</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Someone please gag that man. Alert the
media, I launch the gas. Refuse payment, I launch the gas. It is just
after midnight. You have 36 hours - all of today and half of tomorrow,
until 12 noon - to transfer the money. Don’t even consider the standard
counter measure, General.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: What’s the potential casualty rate
of a single rocket armed with V.X., General Peterson?</p>
<p><strong>general peterson</strong>: In a dense urban area, sixty,
seventy …</p>
<p><strong>rayden sinclair</strong>: Well that’s not so bad …</p>
<p><strong>i general peterson</strong>: Thousand. Seventy thousand.
Dead. one teaspoon will kill all living organisms in a three story
office building. Get the point?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: What did Hummel mean by
“,standard countermeasure,” General?</p>
<p><strong>general peterson</strong>: Napalm. Standard pgison gas can be
neutralized by napalm. It burns it up – consumes it upon detonation. The
problem is that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to
withstand napalm. Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: ’Course he does. “Willy Peter,”
short for “White Phosphorous Incendiary Device,” still in its test
phase. It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X. That
explains Hummells time frame. He knows we’re not operational. What would
it take, General?</p>
<p><strong>general peterson</strong>: To equip a flight of F-16s with
Willy Peter in 36 hours? An act of God. All right, we can try. But view
the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Then on to our primary initiative.
Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. Who’s your best chemical
biological man?</p>
<p><strong>agent wood</strong>: I’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Tell him to pack a bag for
San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Don’t stop… do no stop.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Shit, shit, shit what time is it. Hello.
I’ll be downstairs in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’ve got to go to San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: No. I’m sorry, but NO. I need you here with
me. We need to talk about this…</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’ve got to go. She grabs his arm. I
can’t… I cannot deal with this right now … Bill, I am very Catholic. And
very pregnant. And very unmarried. Help me with this.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I love you. I will marry you. I just
didn’t plan on this, that’s all. Tell you what: come to San
Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Really? Really?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: It’s probably just a training exercise.
Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I’ll finish up my business
and …</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: … We’ll finish what we started. Baby, are you
sexy in those boots …</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: A precision night drop is out
due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the
first shot, Hummel might launch. My second in command is working on an
attack from within the prison. The idea is to penetrate the tunnels
under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines
from behind - take their rocket positions without a shot fired. But I
need better intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: You’ve studied the architectural
plans.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: They’re useless. Alcatraz was
originally a Civil War fort. It’s been ripped up and rebuilt for years.
Under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language. What I need is
personal, firsthand intelligence on the island’s tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: The former warden?</p>
<p><strong>agent wood</strong>: Died in 1979. The guards we contacted
are useless. There was a janitor, “Alcatraz Al”. He worked there for
twenty years, but he died in 1983.</p>
<p><strong>general peterson</strong>: Didn’t three guys escape? I
thought I saw a movie about it.</p>
<p><strong>agent wood</strong>: It’s a Hollywood myth. No one’s escaped
Alcatraz and lived.</p>
<p><strong>c.i.a. directory amway</strong>: There is someone who can
help us.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: The C.I.A. Director and I
have something to discuss in private.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: You’re not actually
suggesting …</p>
<p><strong>c.i.a. directory amway</strong>: The man spent every night
for six months making a dry-run of his escape. He knows every inch of
that island. We have to, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: I am very uncomfortable
about this.</p>
<p>****: I knew, I knew someday, this would come back to bite us.</p>
<p><strong>c.i.a. directory amway</strong>: it won’t bite anyone - if
handled correctly. When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: when he escaped from San
Quentin.</p>
<p><strong>c.i.a. directory amway</strong>: The man was an S.A.S.
trained killer.</p>
<p><strong>c.i.a. directory amway</strong>: Can we risk letting.him
out?</p>
<p><strong>c.i.a. directory amway</strong>: The question is: can we
not?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: I’m told you’re our best
chemical weapons man, Goodspeed. What’s your education?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: B.A. Columbia. M.A. and P.H.D., Johns
Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Excellent. What do you know
about V.X. gas?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: This isn’t a training exercise, is it
sir.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: No Goodspeed. It’s not a
training exercise.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: The following is a state
secret. Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution.
His name is John Mason. A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz
island in 1962, escaped in 1963.</p>
<p><strong>agent sanchez</strong>: Director, no one’s ever escaped from
Alcatraz …</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: I’m telling you facts, Agent
Sanchez. Do not argue and do not question. He was recaptured and sent to
San Quentin, from which he escaped in February, 1976. He’s been held at
Wolfburg since. He has no identity. He does not exist. Understood? I
want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took
through the island’s tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>agent sanchez</strong>: You want him conscious or unconscious
afterward?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Don’t even entertain it.
This man laughs at strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn’t work
either.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Why’s he going to help us now?</p>
<p><strong>u.s. attorney reynolds</strong>: Mason’s papers are in order,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Because I’m willing to give
him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon.</p>
<p><strong>agent sanchez</strong>: Steep price for some information. I
don’t need that to get what you want.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Sanchez - try subtlety.</p>
<p><strong>agent sanchez</strong>: It’s my middle name. Watch kid, maybe
you’ll learn something.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: I ask for an interrogator
and what do I get …</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Jesus look at this guy.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: I’m F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge
Sanchez.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: In charge of what? Fucking me over for
another three decades?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Hey. Easy. I just want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez?
Fucking Bloody Idiots. I don’t want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Just some questions about Alcatraz. It’s a
tourist attraction now. You remember Alcatraz, Mason.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Do I remember Alcatraz.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Not the island itself. The tunnels
underneath it.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Real subtle, SANCHEZ…</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: There’s no harm in cooperating with us.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Who’s “us?” F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do
that?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Maybe there’s a gift in it for you.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: “I fear the Greeks even when they bring
gifts.”</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Are you capable of reading, Sanchez?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: I don’t have time for this shit… Yes. I can
read.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: The story of Alchimadus. Know it?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Ancient Greece. Alchimadus was imprisoned
by his king.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Thomas a Beckett. Heard of him?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Maybe. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Archbishop of Canterbury. Imprisoned and
executed by Henry the Second …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Solzhenitsyn. I’ve a sneaking suspicion
you’ve heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Russian poet and dissident exiled to
Siberia.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Look, I’m asking the fucking questions
here. You can trust the F.B.I.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: That’s a good one, Sanchez. What do you call
and F.B.I. Agent who can’t tell a lie? A mute.</p>
<p>****: Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word with you?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Here, call your lawyer and tell him you’re
going back to jail.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Impressive, Sanchez.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You mind if… uhm…. I take a shot?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: He’ll eat him alive.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: He’s already had you for the
first course. Go.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Take his cuffs off.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: No actually, I’m Bill Goodspeed.
Mr. Mason, we really need your help. That’s a pardon and release
contract from the Attorney Generals office. It makes you a free man,
provided you cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’m a field agent.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Tell me what you really do.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Don’t answer that, GOODSPEED
….</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’m a chemical biological weapons
expert.</p>
<p><strong>in the interrogation room mason</strong>: stares at the
pardon contract, thinking.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You said I’d be a free man. Define free</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Uhm, well, emancipated. Unfettered.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I know what the fucking word means, idiot. In
this context.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I don’t understand….</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: During the time I cooperate, will I be
outside? Outside a jail?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Well yes I suppose …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You suppose?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Yes. You’ll be outside.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Don’t give away the farm,
Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What’s happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: A hostage situation. A matter of life and
death.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours
in the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists. I want a shower and a
new suit of clothes.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I think we can arrange that.</p>
<p><strong>int. f.b.i. ~ observation room - day sanchez</strong>: and
GOODSPEED enter.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Why didn’t you throw in a trip to Fiji?</p>
<p><strong>u.s. attorney reynolds</strong>: I’ll have this forwarded to
the President, Director.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: No. You’ll give it to me.
Give it to me, Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Show Attorney Reynolds
outside there’s a car waiting for him. And SANCHEZ - I’ll handle the
next stage.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Sir, that’s a legal document.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: I’ll decide what’s legal,
Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Sir, those references to Alchimadus,
Beckett, Solzhenitsyn: all had something in common.</p>
<p><strong>in the interrogation room - mason</strong>: picks up the
coin. It has a DEEP BURR in it. He moves to the mirror; begins carving
into the glass.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: They were imprisoned for doing nothing
wrong. What’s going on, sir?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: You’re out of your depth,
Goodspeed. You are on a need to know basis and you do not need to
know.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: one more thing: a shave and a haircut. Hello
Womack.</p>
<p><strong>cpt. giler</strong>: What it’s all about, sir: Willy Peter
burns steel, burns titanium; it’ll sure burn up your poison and
everything else in the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>general peterson</strong>: I need four F-16’s equipped with
air-to-ground missiles within… …. twenty-six hours.</p>
<p><strong>lt. fisk</strong>: Let me name some things that are more
possible, General, with all due respect: winning the Lottery, climbing
Mt. Everest barefoot, getting a parking space at Yankee Stadium,
marrying Sharon Stone …</p>
<p><strong>cpt. giler</strong>: Can’t do it, General.</p>
<p><strong>general peterson</strong>: You can. And you will.</p>
<p><strong>cpt. giler</strong>: Get yer minds off Budweiser, baseball,
and broads, fellahs - we’re goin, ,round the clock!</p>
<p>****: Hi! Bill and Carla ain’t in! State your business! Make it
interesting!</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Listen Carla: I’ll explain later, but

<p>****: I repeat, don’t come to San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Like hell I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>int. f.b.i. van - back compartment - continuous ,
goodspeed</strong>: clicks off the phone, thinking, nervous.GOODSPEED
notices that MASON is staring at him.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Who’s Carla? And why don’t you want her to
come to San Francisco?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You’re on a need to know basis and you
don’t need to know.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You learn that line in Cub Scouts,
Goodspeed?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: I personally picked this
suite. Only one exit.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom - mason</strong>: emerges from the shower
wearing a huge hotel bathrobe.</p>
<p><strong>marshal cord</strong>: Put ’em on. You’ve got forty-five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You going to stand there and watch?</p>
<p><strong>marshal cord</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: well if it excites-you …</p>
<p><strong>marshal cord</strong>: Put the goddamn clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: I can’t do a decent job with these.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: That’s all you get.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: I’m an artist, not a barber.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: without these he can’t stab
you in the throat.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Shall we do this outside? In the
sunshine?</p>
<p><strong>on the suite’s balcony mason</strong>: sits in the sun on a
balcony chair. Bib on.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: How would you like it sir?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: whatever’s in style.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: oh fabulous. You look shabby. Shall I snip
and cut the shabbiness away?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Good. Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Yes of course. My secretary will take care of
you.- See to the good man will you?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What say we bury the hatchet, Womack.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: In your head.</p>
<p><strong>– mason</strong>: on the balcony, clutching the other end of
the nylon clothesline, staring at Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Jesus… JESUS CHRIST….</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: - Drop the gun or I’ll drop your boss.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. agent</strong>: Holy shit, we got a jumper.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. agent 2</strong>: Looks like…. Womack… !</p>
<p><strong>ent. fairmont hotel - penthouse suite - day mason</strong>:
and GOODSPEED as before.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Whoops …. I’m feeling tired …. Whoops ….
MASON lets Womack drop a foot. Womack SCREAMS! GOODSPEED drops his gun
and grabs the clothesline. MASON bolts from the balcony into the suitels
library.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: All units, this is Caretaker. WE’VE GOT A
SIGNAL SIX. Mason’s in the elevator! Let me know where he stops!</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: exits, looking at MASON getting into the
HUMVEE. The Humvee explodes out of the hotel driveway.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: That’s him!</p>
<p><strong>int. mason’s car - driving - day mason</strong>: looks-up in
the rear view mirror. The F.B.I. SEDANS are behind him, closing fast.
MASON rams the stickshift into gear; throws the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>radio newsman</strong>: This just in: More than twenty
highway patrolmen are involved in a highspeed chase on Van Ness

<p><strong>mason</strong>: John Mason. Don’t be shocked. I don’t have

<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Where is he sir? RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
What’s he doing? HE’S ON THE PHONE. I DON’T FUCKING KNOW, HIS
STOCKBROKER! Oh shit. Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Shit shit SHIT SHIT …</p>

<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: Wolfburg, got it. Masconi, Magrane,
Masters. No MASON in Wolfburg, Bill, is this arelative of yours… ?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: NOT NOW Isherwood. Go to February 1976.
Who was transferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin that year?</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: Two guys. Joseph Wainwright, and a…. they
don’t have a name, just “inmate 9999?”</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Hit nine nine nine nine.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: This is weird. They got medical records,
place of birth - Glasgow? but no name. Wait a minute, there’s a next of
kin. Jade Angelou of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco. Bill did you,
like, fuck something up? Bill? Bill?</p>
<p><strong>ext. san francisco - piazza des artes - day mason</strong>:
stands next to a massive column, writing on a piece of paper:</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Jade.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Hello. Yes. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I uhm… I’m not quite sure what to say. This is
all a bit much …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Let’s uhm… let’s walk a ways.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: So how long have you been out?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: A while.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: A while. And you didn’t call? You are free
now, right?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I’m here with you, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Why now? I mean why today.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I was driving through San Francisco. I
decided it was time.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Well there’s not a lot I know about you other
than you escaped from San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother,
and I’m the result. You can imagine I’m pretty confused.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I tried to explain in my letters.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Ahh. Your letters. They weren’t very easy to
follow.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I see. Bloody prison censors.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: How about explaining now?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Maybe this isn’t the best time… Jade. Here
sitdown.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: All will be explained. You must trust me on
this. Someday very soon, after I get a few things settled, I will come
back for you. What I need to know is: do you want me in your life?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: How can I answer that? I don’t know if we
can…. after 19 years, just start like that.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: We are the same blood.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: But I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: where to begin. My name is John Paul Mason.
I’m Scottish. I attended Dartmouth Naval College. My favorite color is
green. I like books. I like a good joke. At one time I shot a pretty
fair round of golf. I’m in my 60’s and I’ve been in jail half my life.
Maybe it’s better I go.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: No. You’re doing okay.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: You lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: F.B.I. miss. Your father is working with
us. He’s helping us resolve a…. …. dangerous situation.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: He is?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Yes madam. We’ve got to go, John.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Jade - remember what I said.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: No cuffs until we get to the cars,</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You surprise me, Goodspeed. Now I’m going to
surprise myself: thank-you, you could have handled that differently.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You almost got me killed. Twice.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Hows your jaw?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: You cocksucker you
dislocated my shoulder and cost the city of San Francisco ten million
dollars. You try to escape again and Agent Chaney here will break your
legs.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>at a rectangular table - mason</strong>: sits at the head of
the table 122 in front of a SCALE MODEL OF ALCATRAZ. COMMANDER ANDERSON
and ten NAVY S.E.A.L.s look toward Mason.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Okay, one more time: down this
second fork fifty-seven paces to a septic chamber. Turn left at the
water pump, then forty-two paces to the prison showers …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: No. Forty-two paces to the septic chamber.
Fifty-seven to the showers.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: That’s not what you said three
minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: It’s not?</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Excuse me. Womack.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: I ask for someone with knowledge
of the island’s tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play
“twenty questions.”</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: He knows every inch of those
tunnels, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Then he’s keeping it to himself.
He’s fucking with me and I don’t have the time.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: What if he went with
you?</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Out of the question. He’ll
endanger the mission - he’ll endanger my men. He’s a security risk. Who
says he won’t bolt as soon as we turn our backs on him?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: I’ll handle that.
Chaney.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: You’re not cooperating,
John. Maybe this will help. I’m sure you’re curious about what’s
happening on Alcatraz. Twelve United States Marines - a terrorist rogue
force - have seized it. They’ve aimed fifteen poison gas rockets at the
city. Enough poison gas to kill every man, woman and child in San
Francisco. Yes, John, including your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You son-of-fucking-Satan.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. directoa womack</strong>: Mr. MASON has a strong
incentive to help us, Commander Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Get him some gear. He’s
going to the Rock. Goodspeed!</p>
<p><strong>across the room - goodspeed</strong>: looks up from a
computer screen generating 3-D images of different angles of a V.X.
ROCKET. He walks over to the table. Anderson and the other S.E.A.L.s
stare at him.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: The goal is to take out the
launchers and neutralize the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed. Tell us what
you know.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Well, the thermal imaging photos picked
up the poison gas. Here. The prison morgue. It’s probably being kept
refrigerated. makes sense. V.X. gas begins to lose its toxicity at
higher temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Have you ever actually seen one
of these devices?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: No sir, but I’ve studied them ….</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: That’s great, Goodspeed. You’re
in the Bureau, so you’ve had weapons training.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: A little, sir.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: So you’ve never been in a combat
situation.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: No sir. Should I begin the briefing on
diffusing and detoxification sir?</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Sir, these are very complicated
devices…</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: I know they are, Goodspeed.
That’s why you’re going with us.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Get him some gear.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Wait just a minute. This little twat’s going
to deal with the poison? He’s gonna get us all fuckin’ killed!</p>
<p><strong>s.e.a.l. dando</strong>: Nice to meet you too.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: You look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: You’re not wimping out on us,
Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.
They say, “Bill, you’re too fucking smart for field work.” Every year I
put in for a transfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the
fucking Maytag repairman in the commercial. Then the call finally comes,
and it’s a whole fuckin, city at stake? Oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Chemical Weapons isn’t a cakewalk,
Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’ve got some bad news and some really
bad news sir. Maybe the bad news isn’t bad, maybe actually it’s good
….</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Spit it out.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: My girlfriend’s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: What’s the really bad news.</p>
<p>****: Goodspeed, GODDAMN IT …</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Agent Cord, get over to the Pan Pacific
Hotel and bring Goodspeed’s girlfriend to this facility please!!</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Seventeen hours left. What the fuck
is he doing? How much time does it take to transfer money from one

dollars richer.</p>
<p>****: Hummel.</p>
<p><strong>security advisor louis lindstrom</strong>: Hello Frank, Lou
Lindstrom. I’m in the oval office with General Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: We’re having some problems with the
account transfer, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Don’t tell me your problems, tell me your
solutions.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: We’ve spoken to the President. He’s
not too happy about this.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Well he’d better give me a goddamn assurance
…</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: The only thing the President will
give you is a fair trial after you’re caught, General.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: That you, Sinclair? What exactly do you do
at the White House? Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential
limousine? Are you his golf caddy, Sinclair?</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: Now you give me some coddamn
respect, General ….</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: You want respect, you child, you coffee
server? Let’s talk about Dave Ridgeway.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Who’s Dave Ridgeway, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: A twenty-two year old marine tortured to
death by a communist death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle. His mother
and young wife were told by the Pentagon that he went A.W.O.L. Let’s
talk about the respect he got.</p>
<p><strong>louis lindstrom</strong>: This is going nowhere Frank ….</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Then let me tell you what is: The most
lethal poison gas known to man into San Franciscols business district.
You have twelve hours to deliver the money or be prepared to reap the
whirlwind, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>louis lindstrom</strong>: What’s the word from Mojave?</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: General Petersen can give us no
definite assurance on the Willy Peter capability.</p>
<p><strong>louis lindstrom</strong>: Greenlight the S.E.A.L.
incursion.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Listen up, men. Mr. MASON here
will run point for us. Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your hip,
Mason. You breath, he breathes with you. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Shep, what’s the status on the
special operational gear for Mason.</p>
<p><strong>s.e.a.l. shepherd</strong>: one aluminum fork and one quart
of motor oil in a squeeze tube.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Motor oil?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: For cottonmouth.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: GOODSPEED here’s our specialist.
We will cover him while he neutralizes the’ chemical threat. If he does
his job we’ll launch flares and hold our position ’till the cavalry
comes. Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are going in against an
entrenched force led by one hot-shit field commander. We are in the
fight of our lives, I bullshit you not. Any questions? Let’s move
out.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: After you, ’lace.”</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Activate mini-cams.</p>
<p><strong>naval medic</strong>: Atropine. Any contact with the gas, use
it.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Uhn uhn. I hate needles.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Mini-cams operational.</p>

<p><strong>f.b.i. radar technician</strong>: They’re off radar, headin’
’round Treasure Island.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Prepare to deplore!</p>

<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: No time for the torch.
Explosives’ll bring the fucking world down on us. An idea, please, we’re

<p><strong>mason</strong>: Wait for me to unlock the door.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: You do not look like Jesus
Christ, Mr. Mason, so I’m having a hard time how you’re going to
accomplish that.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Under there.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: You are shitting me. You catch
one of those steam bursts and you’re a corpse.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: True. I memorized their timing.</p>
<p><strong>s.e.a.l. shepherd</strong>: Uhh sir, you said never leave his
side …</p>

Lieutenant Shepherd. This man is going to die.</p>

<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Anderson here, General Hummel.
Commander. Team Leader.</p>
<p>****: Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of
your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on
the deck at their feet-</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Oh Christ this isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: Sir, we know why you’re out
here. God knows I agree with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to
defend this country against all enemies. Foreign, sir, and domestic.
General, we’ve spilled the same blood in the same mud. You know goddamn
well that I cannot give that order…</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Your unit is covered from an elevated
position, Commander. I’m not going to ask again.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Don’t do anything stupid, Commander. No one
has to die here.</p>
<p><strong>commander anderson</strong>: You men following the General:
You are United States Marines and under oath you forgotten that? We all
have shipmates we remember - some of ’em were shit on and spit on by the
Pentagon - that doesn’t give you the right to mutiny.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: That’s a nice speech, Commander. I heard
plenty like it in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. They all added up to
zero. Pretty words aren’t gonna get you out of this, Commander. Now
abort this mission. Goddamn it, abort.</p>
<p><strong>s.e.a.l. boyer</strong>: It’s us or them, Reigert, fuck
they’re gonna waste us …</p>
<p><strong>s.e.a.l. reigert</strong>: Get a grip on yourself ….</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Don’ t do it.</p>
<p><strong>s.e.a.l. shepherd</strong>: Let go of me.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. technician</strong>: We’ve still got movement. Numbers
eleven and twelve. That’s GOODSPEED and…. Mason.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: If mason’s still alive, it’s
not over.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: We’re never gettin off this island.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: …. god Jesus we’re gonna die</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: You told me I am on a “need to know” basis.
Well goddamn it, I need to know. Who the fuck is John Mason. Start
talking, Director, or I swear I will go to the press.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: 1962. J. Edgar Hoover is
head of the F.B.I., some say the country. It’s no secret the esteemed
Mr. Hoover kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans. de
Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the Prime Minister. The man
had dirt on everyone in the world,</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: The British sent over their
best operative, John Mason, to steal it.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: Our agents caught MASON at
the Canadian border but with no microfilm. It’s never been found. So
Hoover held him without trial. The British claimed they didn’t know
him.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: What about the daughter? why didn’t Hoover
use her as leverage?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: He died in 1972. She wasn’t
born yet Today it’s a different Bureau and no one wants to touch
this.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: My god, you’re not saying …</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. director womack</strong>: John MASON has been
incarcerated without trial on American soil since 1962. He knows our
most intimate secrets of the last half century. The alien landing at
Roswell, the truth about the J.F.K. assassination.</p>
<p>****: John MASON was an S.A.S. trained killer, one of MI-6’s best
operatives ever - John MASON was one of the most dangerous men on
earth.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Don’t shoot me. MASON was actually
slinging it over his shoulder…</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: For christ’s sake. MASON trudges down the
tu=el. Goodspeed follows him.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Wait. Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Off this island. You mind?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Yes I mind. I mind very much.</p>
<p>****: Goodspeed, Goodspeed, come in.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You’ve got a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: It’s me sir.</p>
<p>****: What is happening? Where’s Mason?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: He says he’s leaving the island sir.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Don’t let him do that.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: He’s got a gun, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?
Get him back!</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I never wanted this. Jesus christ.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: We knew it might happen, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Maybe now they’ll pay up.</p>
<p><strong>captain hendrix</strong>: Maybe now they won’t.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Then maybe we’ll execute a few
hostages.</p>
<p><strong>s.e.a.l. dando</strong>: You’ll go to hell for this
General.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Put a bullet in him.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: You heard him. End it.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: He’s dead anyway sir.</p>
<p>****: You have a made a terrible mistake and more of our brothers
have died in vain. Let’s not repeat this.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. crisp</strong>: General! This man’s weapons and tac
radio are missing!</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Rodent problem, people. Let’s flush the
pipes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alcatraz - main cell house - night</strong>: Hummel and
his men exit the Main Cell House and fan out in teams across the
island.</p>
<p><strong>int. tunnels under alcatraz - night</strong>: Goodspeed’s
still trailing after Mason.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: would you stop. Just stop. I don’t know
whatyou did or why you were sent to jail, but there are a million people
across that bay who might die… Fuck this. Stop. Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>captain hendrix</strong>: Rodents located.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: F.B.I. Stop right there. I really mean
it.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: If you really mean it, take the safety
off.</p>
<p>****: Goodspeed. Goodspeed, come in. Have you resolved this?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Now he has all the guns, sir. . You’ve
got to help me. What do you want me to do, beg?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Save your breath and your dignity, if you
have any. I am leaving. I am getting my daughter and getting the hell
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>down the tunnel - mason and goodspeed</strong>: see the wall
of flame ROARING toward them. MASON grabs Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Hold your breath.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Come on. And keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Came out right through there. ’Course I’ve
gained a few since …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Across that, then 50 yards to the morgue. You
said that’s where the fucking poison is, Goodspeed.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I don’t get it. You’re going to help
me?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: No. I’m going to give you dancing lessons.
What the fuck do you think?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You don’t have to get all bent out of
shape.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What’s bent out of shape, idiot, is the
tunnel I was going through to freedom five minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: All right, all right. Don’t call me
idiot, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Stop. There. And there.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Cottonmouth snakes. They breath through their
skin. Oil clogs it. They hate the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: sprays the motor oil across the pool. The
snakes scatter. The pool’s now coated with an OIL SLICK. MASON wades in.
Goodspeed follows.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Something’s a little off here: I’m the
F.B.I. Agent, you’re the convict, and you have all the guns.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: The morgue?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Never hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You didn’t learn that in prison.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: No, and I used to be a lot quicker.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’ve got some questions for you but they
can wait.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Careful. The second you don’t respect
this, it kills you.</p>
<p><strong>strand of v.x. poison pearls</strong>: ping-pong ball sized
glass bubbles filled with poison.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I need a hand here. Mason. Now.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.
MASON holds it like a string of wind chimes.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What… exactly does this do to you?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and
you’ll know: A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes the
nervous system. Then loss of muscular function. Then you spit your guts
out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled on the floor, then your
skin turns black…</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Sounds like my first marriage.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Pier 39 come in.</p>
<p>****: Goodspeed? Where the hell have you been. Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: We’re in the morgue. I’m removing the
rocket’s guidance system chips. Without em the rocketslll fly about 500
feet and splash down like a wounded duck.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: moves on to the third and fourth chem
rounds. Suddenly there’s a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl. Pvt.
Gamble’s WALKIE TALKIE is talking to them:</p>
<p>****: Gamble, Starling. Come in.</p>
<p>****: Privates Gamble and Starling, come in.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: The morgue. Hummel and Baxter exit
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>int. alcatraz - morgue - night</strong>: GOODSPEED goes
faster; his hands are sweating, trembling. It’s like he’s lost his
spine.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: C’mon c’mon…. faster ….</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I thought you were cool under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Shut up; you’re making me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>int. alcatraz - morgue - night</strong>: GOODSPEED has dealt
with eight chem rounds. There should be seven more, but there’s not.
GOODSPEED counts them ….</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: They’ll be on us in twenty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Wait a minute. Fuck. Hummel stole fifteen
chem rounds. There’s only twelve here. Here. Quickly. Do these last
four.</p>
<p><strong>– mason and goodspeed</strong>: sprinting across floor,
BULLETS chewing the floor. They dive into the MORGUE INCINERATOR CHUTE,
GOODSPEED leaving the tac radio behind ….</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Hendrix! Take Royce and Scarpetti!</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Gamble and Starling are dead.</p>
<p><strong>in cart 1 - mason</strong>: and GOODSPEED duck as BULLETS
RICOCHET around the tunnel walls. They pop up and return fire.</p>
<p><strong>in cart 1 - mason and goodspeed</strong>: duck as the GRENADE
PROJECTILE wings over their heads, continues down the tunnel and
DETONATES against the tunnel wall.</p>
<p><strong>in cart 1 ~ goodspeed</strong>: looks over his shoulder at
MASON and Hendrix locked in mortal combat. He pulls the CART BRAKE. Cart
1 begins slowing down. CART 2 rams into it. Now Carts 1 and 2 are
together. And on comes –</p>
<p><strong>in cart 1 - goodspeed</strong>: realizes that his cart is
going to ram Mason’s outstretched head. He releases the brake, and Cart
1 picks up speed …</p>
<p><strong>in cart 1 - goodspeed</strong>: pulls the cart brake and
–</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Mason!</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Pretty easy killing an unconscious man.
How about trying me? Punk. What’re you waiting for? Limp dick.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: I am going to fuck you up something fierce.
You rolled the wrong number, shithead. You crapped out.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I rolled snake-eyes. Shithead.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Limp dick?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: It’s all I could think of.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I think I’ve got arthritis.</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: The President arrives in three
hours. His directive is to string Hummel along until the airstrike is
operational.</p>
<p><strong>louis lindstrom</strong>: What’s the word from Mojave,
General?</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: They’re going as fast as they
can.</p>
<p><strong>lt. fisk</strong>: We’re fucked, cap’n.</p>
<p><strong>cpt. giler</strong>: Are we fucked with a pencil or are we
fucked with a baseball bat.</p>
<p><strong>lt. fisk</strong>: We’re fucked with a telephone pole. we can
arm em with Willy Peter, no problem, but negatory pn smart bomb
capability.</p>
<p><strong>cpt. giler</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>lt. fisk</strong>: The pilots are gonna have to drop em
manually. We’re talkin, retro, baby. We’re talkin’ World War II.</p>
<p>****: Attention Navy Seals, attention.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: He thinks we’re Seals.</p>
<p>****: Congratulations. You’ve taken some things of mine. I can’t
convince you to return them so I’ll put on someone who can.</p>
<p>****: Hell… hello.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Tell them your name and age.</p>
<p><strong>larry henderson</strong>: My n…name is L… larry Henderson.
I’m forty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Good Mr. Henderson, continue …</p>
<p><strong>larry henderson</strong>: I don’t know who you are, but p
please, there’s a gun</p>
<p><strong>ext. alcatraz - behind china alley - night mason</strong>:
and Goodspeed, crestfallen, listen. LARRY HENDERSON … and they’re going
to oh god… … please don’t kill me</p>
<p>****: Convinced? Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: What, vou?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I’m not the chemical weapons expert.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Good point. Okay here, take ’em.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Now they only have three rockets left.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: What about Mr. Henderson?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Hummel’s a soldier, not a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Find the rockets. If they’re guarded, kill
the men guarding them.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I… I don’t know if I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: There’s only one way to find out. I’ll try to
give you time. And Goodspeed…. Don’t be an idiot. Put that on.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Well thank-you, thank-you very much.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Gotta be kidding me. They send an
old man.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I thought I’d been in the service a long
time. Name and rank, sailor.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: John Paul Mason. Royal Navy. Commander.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: You’re a long way from England, Commander
Mason.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I feel strangely at home.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Do you have some unique knowledge of this
prison facility, Commander Mason?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Quite unique.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I was a guest here.</p>
<p>****: Freeze. Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>on the grated level above goodspeed</strong>: - PVT. MCCOY
appears. Looking down, he sees GOODSPEED and Cox. He cinches his
REPELLING CLIP to the steel railing.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Well you’re some kind of joker, Mason. Maybe
you’re a lunatic. Are you of sound mind, Mason?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I’m not threatening the lives of a million
innocent people. You are.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Give me the guidance chips.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I threw them in the bay.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: That was stupid of you.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Would you have shot him7</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: You seem like a bright man, Commander.
Bright men understand necessity.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Bright men also obey the law. “Wherever law
ends, terror begins.” John Locke.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: “Where there is no law, there is no
transgression.” The Bible. Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Article 7, American Constitution? “Treason
against the United States shall consist of… 11</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: The American Constitution was written by
traitors, Commander. Traitors against a government founded on injustice
and tyranny and stupidity. I see little difference in my motivation.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Do you, Commander Mason?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Frye, Crisp, go!</p>
<p><strong>ext. china ally rocket launching station - night</strong>:
GOODSPEED wildly discharges his gun until CLICK, the clip is spent. Cox
and McCoy step through the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Swallow that and I swear on my Aunt Myrtle’s
grave I’ll cut your belly open and pull it out.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Mason. Mason?</p>
<p>****: It’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Above you. Literally and figuratively.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: is BRAIDING THE STRIPS into a long rope. The
rope is quite finely constructed. Mason’s been at this several
hours.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: This is tiny.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?
Or another portion of your anatomy ….</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: The cell, Mason.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Five feet by seven. Try living in one for a
year. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I only got one chem round. There are two
left. I fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Surprise, surprise.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I’m not a field agent, all right? So cut
me a break.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How
droll.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway
Clmon. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Let’s say our countries had a little dispute.
They both knowingly shafted me.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Familiar with the name Hoover, Goodspeed? I
don’t mean a vacuum cleaner …</p>
<p><strong>general peterson</strong>: Captain Giler?</p>
<p><strong>cpt. giler</strong>: We jerry-rigged a release lever. You’ll
find it on the left side of the cockpit. It’s got two positions: safety
and release. Throw it on release, the bomb drops in five seconds. Change
your mind, throw it back on safety. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Jesus. Why didn’t you just tell Hoover
and the bureau where the microfilm was? Make a trade?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Some trade. They’d get the microfilm and I’d
get a bullet in the head.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I see your point. Something’s been on my
mind. About your escape.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You went down the shower drain, through
the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine and out through
the intake pipe - that much I’ve got ’ But… howld you get out of your
cell?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: I only ask because, in our current
situation, it might be useful information …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Trade secret, Billy, I’ll tell you this: it
was easier than getting in.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: fiercely yanks the rope toward him. The heavy
rolling caster jerks from the floor. The CASTER, pulling the rope, flies
past Mason’s cell –</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: tugs the rope taut like he’s just snagged a
fish. Then he pulls slowly and delicately.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: smiles.</p>
<p><strong>int. goodspeed’s cell - morning</strong>: GOODSPEED hears the
doors opening above him.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Hey! Hey what’s happening? Mason.
Mason?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You’re on your own, kid. Your gear’s over
there.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Shit….</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: grabs his guns and gear and follows after
Mason. 225 EXT. ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel
sits behind the desk. Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him.
Silence. Hummel stares at his phone. The tension is palpable.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Fifteen minutes Frank.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: We have two operational rockets left,
General. One on the lower lighthouse, one on the rooftop, ready for
fire. General.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I heard you Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Prepare for launch General?
General?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: General Hummel, noon is
approaching.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I’m aware of the time, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>louis lindstrom</strong>: When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Seven hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>general kramer</strong>: Get me the President.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Mason. John. What happened - the
injustice done to you - doesn’t mean you can walk away from this. A
million people across that Bay will die.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Only one of them I care about.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You were once a different man.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: You don’t know what kind of man I was.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You were a civil servant. Sworn to do
your duty. Just like me.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Eleven fifty-seven, General. Three
minutes to go.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: They’re going to call.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: They are not going to call
General.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I… I don’t understand this.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: I understand it. They’re calling our
bluff. We have two operational rockets left. We have to stick one of
those rockets in their ear, General.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Atom?</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: I’…I don’t know Frank.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Seventy thousand peqple… I didn’t… i didn’t
ever…</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: You didn’t ever what? You didn’t ever
what, General? General, forty-eight hours ago I was in a cushy job at
Pendleton. As of this moment I am subject to prosecution for treason and
murder. Do you know what that means. It means the electric chair. For
all of us.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: He’s right Frank. Authorize the launch or
it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Authorize the launch, General.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I once swam the English Channel, but you’re
entitled to your,opinion.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Fine. I’ll fuckin, do it myself.</p>
<p>****: Launch coordinates 675 dash 439.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: Aye aye General: coordinates 675 dash
Awaiting launch command.</p>
<p>****: General, your command.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: My god. MASON looks up. GOODSPEED stands
above on the embankment.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: That change things?</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. radar technician</strong>: They fired a rocket. It’s
headed east.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: East. But that’s… Oakland. My god. The
football game.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: comes back up the embankment. Faces
Goodspeed-with grim resolve:</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Partners?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Partners.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene - hummel</strong>: watches the video monitor
nervously. His jaws twitch.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. radar technician</strong>: Sir, it’s heading.,.into
the bay?</p>
<p><strong>ciwter fisherman</strong>: What the hell…. ?</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftop of main cell house - day</strong>: Frye and
Crisp stare across the Bay in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: I don’t believe it. He pulled the
plug.</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: They need a decision
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: These past few hours have been the
longest, darkest of my life. This is when you wish the buck did not stop
here. A balance between two tragedies. On one hand the fate of a million
civilians. On the other, Frank Hummel. That we have ignored or abandoned
or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel and that American boys
have paid the price of that neglect in blood, is equally real, and
equally tragic.</p>
<p><strong>hayden sinclair</strong>: The glass is half full not half
empty, sir. No civilian casualties so far.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I don’t believe in half full or half
empty, Sinclair. There are chemical weapons and there are civilians. And
there are men on Alcatraz wholve proved they’re willing to use the one
on the other. We are at war with terror. Fighting a war means
casualties. This is the worst call I’ve ever had to make. Air strike
approved.</p>
<p><strong>int. alcatraz - infirmary command center - day</strong>:
Frye, Darrow and Baxter. All staring at Hummel.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: You’re gutless. I knew it.</p>

were you.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: I’m relieving you of your command
General. Captain Frye?</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Major?</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Tom?</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: It’s over Frank. I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Tom, I warn you.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: Stand down, General.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: I’m giving you a direct order.</p>
<p><strong>baxter</strong>: I’m not accepting it.</p>
<p><strong>in the adjacent room - goodspeed</strong>: and MASON exchange
a tense look. mason aims his gun through the slit …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: FIRES through the slit, killing Baxter as

<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: grabs the semi-consious Hummel and drags
him down the corridor-.</p>
<p><strong>in the infirmary washroom - goodspeed</strong>: drags Hummel
inside. Hummel collapses against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: My god what have I done …</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: It’s not too late, General. Tell me where
the last chem round is.</p>
<p><strong>hummel</strong>: Lower lighthouse …</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Do your job, Billy. - I’ll try to hold ,em
off.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: blasts away at Frye and Darrow, allowing
GOODSPEED to sprint for the exit toward the lower lighthouse.</p>

INFIRMARY -</p>
<p><strong>corridor - day mason</strong>: advances toward the command
center’s door. Suddenly the HEAVY STEEL DOOR creaks open and –</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: dives away as the satchel DETONATES,
imploding the corridor walls, collapsing the,ceiling. mason’s engulfed
in two tons of-plaster and crumbled cinder block.</p>
<p><strong>captain frye</strong>: Crisp, Darrow, come in… Cox, McCoy,
get your asses up here!</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: Give that to me.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You shoot me, I’ll drop this and we’re
both dead. One of these pearlslll kill everything within 200 feet. You
know how this shit works?</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: You know how this shit works?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: You know the Elton John son, “Rocket
Man”?</p>
<p><strong>captain darrow</strong>: I hate it.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: Well it happens to be my favorite fuckin,

happen.</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: exits and kneels, reaching for HIS OTHER
PANTLEG. PUllS out his GREEN FLARES. He cracks the flares and fires them
up.</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. technician</strong>: Ten seconds to the drop zone. And
now counting eight, seven, six …</p>
<p><strong>f.b.i. technician</strong>: Green smoke! It’s…
GOODSPEED!!</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Abort. Abort immediately.</p>
<p><strong>rear f-16 pilot</strong>: Sir, something’s wrong. I can’t
disengage… !</p>
<p><strong>lead f-16 pilot</strong>: Then peel off…</p>

don’t deserve to go back.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Goodspeed. You know the etymology of your
name?</p>
<p><strong>goodspeed</strong>: God’s speed.</p>

<p><strong>ext. alcatraz - dock - day</strong>: GOODSPEED is standing on
the dock. Sanchez comes down the gangplank.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: You surprised me, kid. Never thought you
