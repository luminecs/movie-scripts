<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Sorry, hon. I didn’t know Orrin Hatch was out
of his pen. Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in
first thing.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Craig, listen, honey, I’ve been thinking…
maybe you’d feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: We’ve been over this. Nobody’s looking for a
puppeteer in today’s wintry economic climate.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Well, you know, maybe something else until
this whole puppet thing turns around.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: The Great Mantini doesn’t need a day job.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Craig, everyone can’t be Derek Mantini. Well,
grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be
a little under the weather this morning.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Which one is Elijah again?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: The monkey.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: The crowd is enthralled as Derek
Mantini, arguably the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world,
performs “The Belle of Amherst” with his 60 foot Emily Dickinson puppet,
directed by the inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.</p>
<p><strong>charles nelson reilly</strong>: Beautiful, beautiful!
Nyong-nyong.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Gimmicky bastard.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Is the trial date set?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: May 11th.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Why’d you do it, Craig?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m a puppeteer.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Why, Craig. why?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I… puppeteer.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You know, maybe you should speak to someone
about this.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Seven and a half, right?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Uh. yeah.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: I’ll take you through it.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Seven and a half.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your
filing needs?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an
interview with Mr. Lester.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m afraid I have no idea what
you’re saying right now.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: My name is Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Money, Miss Warts?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Fork ah did?</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Mr. Juarez?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Yex?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I said “yes.”</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: You suggest what? I have no time for
piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides,
Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Come in, Mr. Juarez. I’d stand, but, well,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz,
Dr. Lester.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Security.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No, it’s okay, sir. Just a mixup with your
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: She’s not my secretary. She’s what they call
an executive liaison, and I’m not banging her, if that’s what you�re
implying.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply
misspoke.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you
can bring to LesterCorp?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Well, sir, I’m an excellent filer.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or…
Glooph?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Glooph is not a letter, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you.
Okay, put these in order.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Floris, get Guinness on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Gehginnis ondah foam?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Fork ah did?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Fine woman, Floris. I don’t know how she
puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You don’t have a speech impediment,
Dr. Lester.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy.
But I’m afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her
doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you’ve
read her memoirs, “I can’t understand a word any of you are saying.”</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Pity, it tells it like it is. That’s why the
eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won’t touch it. That’s a
quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you
can’t understan a word I’m saying, Dr. Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No. I understand perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You
see, I’ve been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable
speech. You’re hired. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Just one. Why is this floor so short?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Low overhead, m’boy. We pass the savings on
to you. But seriously, that’s all covered in orientation.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Perky Industrial Film Music.</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: The 7 1/2 Floor</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor of the
Mertin-Flemmer building. As you will now be spending your work day here,
it is important that you learn a bit about the history of this famous
floor.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Hello, Don.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Hello. Wendy.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Don, I was wondering, do you know why our
workplace has such low ceilings?</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: It’s an interesting story, Wendy. Many years
ago in the late 1800’s, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to
invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided
to erect an office building.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: He would call this building the Mertin-Flemmer
Building, after himself and someone else, who, local legend has it, was
named Flemmer.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: One day. Captain Mertin received an unexpected
visitor.</p>
<p><strong>mertin</strong>: Enter ye, if ye dare enter.</p>
<p><strong>tiny woman</strong>: Captain Mertin?</p>
<p><strong>mertin</strong>: What want ye, girl child?</p>
<p><strong>tiny woman</strong>: I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but
rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.</p>
<p><strong>mertin</strong>: I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou
art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul
demon.</p>
<p><strong>tiny woman</strong>: I am not asking for alms, but rather the
ear of a kind man with a noble heart.</p>
<p><strong>mertin</strong>: Aye. Speak then if ye must.</p>
<p><strong>tiny woman</strong>: Captain Mertin, surely I am a
God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness?
So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why
cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>mertin</strong>: Woman, your story moves me like n other. Me
own sister was tiny and then died. Therefore, I shall make ye me wife.
And I shall build a floor in my building, between the 7th and 8th, which
will be scaled down, so from now on there shall be at least one place on
God’s green Earth that you and your accursed kind can live in peace…</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: So that’s the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents
are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which
for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all… the
overhead is low! Ha ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Ha ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: The End</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Moving story.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yes. Unfortunately it’s bullshit. The real
story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans
raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Well, truth is for suckers, isn’t it?.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Listen. I’m Craig Schwartz, just starting out
at LesterCorp.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public -
like a Frog / To tell one’s name - the livelong June / To an admiring
Bog!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Emily Dickinson.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>parrot</strong>: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Sorry, honey.</p>
<p><strong>parrot</strong>: Sorry honey. Sorry honey.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>parrot</strong>: Help! She’s locking me in a cage!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Isn’t that cute? I just taught her that.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Adorable. What time are they supposed to be
here?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Seven-ish</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: We have to make it an early night.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: They’ll understand. Besides I’ve got a
morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah’s shrink. We’re getting to the
bottom of this acid stomach.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks.
Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good food, Lotte.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Vegetarian, right?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Yes. All vegetable. all the time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No kidding about that 7 1/2 floor. Craig?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No kidding, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: That’s great. It almost sounds like
make-believe. Like a storybook. like a fairy tale. It’s really great. So
Lotte, when you say all vegetable, do you mean all vegetable
entire1y?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Lotte told me that Eskimos have a lot of
words for snow.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Ten, I think.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wonder why so many.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Because they have a lot of snow. Isn’t that
interesting?</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Thank you, Floris.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: You’re not like the other boys we’ve had
here. Granted, I can’t understand what you’re saying either, but your
soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict
your epiglottis.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I am a trained performer.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak,
speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hello again.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yes, well…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You know, I’ve been thinking about what you
said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think
you’re on to something.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: And fifty other lines to get into a girl’s
pants.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No, really.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn’t
have a clue what to do with me. That’s the thing, Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: New puppet?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah, just an idea I had.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: She’s very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Just an idea I had.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: C’mon, let’s go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I would too know what to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Oh, what magic those fingers could work on
the right �cabinet.� Alphabetize me, baby. And don’t forget, I comes
before U.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Floris, you’re very nice, but I’m afraid I�m
in love with somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: I’m afraid I… have no idea what you are
saying… you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Don’t toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I
were eighty years younger, I’d box your ears.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I wasn’t toying with her, sir. I was just…
How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot’s of
it. I swear, it’s almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to
piss sitting down… like a godamn girly… every fifteen minutes. But
nobody wants to die, Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’ll keep that in mind, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: No sir-e-bob, I don’t die. But what I do is
get older, wrinkled like a former plum that’s become the wrinkled prune
you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would
care for me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They
are our link with history.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I don’t want to be your godamn link, damn
you. I want to feel Floris’ naked thighs against my own. I want to know
passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex
woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her.
Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you
share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the
most suitable environment for this type of discussion.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice
Bar after work today and I’ll spill my goddamn guts for you.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I won’t be late. I just have to listen to
Lester’s sexual fantasies and drink carrot juice for a little while.
It’s a job thing.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I gotta go back to work. Yeah, okay. You too.
Okay. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I just wanted to say �hi.� Did you know I
still don’t know your name or where you work?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: How about this, if I can guess your first
name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . .
Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . .
tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee
Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m right?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s incredible! Nobody told me! I swear!
It’s kismet. Maxine! It’s a beautiful name. There’s a psychic
connection. Don’t you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I
will shout it from the rooftops!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Somebody told you.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine.
It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song,
Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I am dubious, but I don’t welsh. Meet me at
The Stuck Pig. Seven o’clock. You’re late, I walk. So help me, if I find
out you cheated.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Imagine a room full of women. Nubile,
blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather.
A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are
on me as I speak. �Ladies,� I begin. �I am the love god, Eros. I
intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Dr. Lester, it’s been really fascinating, but
I’m afraid I have to get home to my wife now.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Wife, huh? I’d love to meet her, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two
of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Just.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Buy you a drink, Maxine?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You married?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah. But enough about me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’ll you have?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: The usual, Barry.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’ll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or
something.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I like you. I don’t know what it is
exactly.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: My tits?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No, no, it’s your energy or your attitude or
the way you carry yourself or…</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Christ, you’re not a fag are you? Because I
don’t want to be wasting my time.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s the usual?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Don�t let the girly shit fool you. It’d blow
your shorts off.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Set me up again, Barry.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I�m not a homosexual. I just like women for
more than their bodies. I guess you could say I’m the new American
male.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You’re a fag or a liar.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I mean, I am really attracted to you.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus,
you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits.
I want to fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Good. Now we’re getting somewhere. Not a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: So, tell me about yourself. If you can get
your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Well, I’m a puppeteer…</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Sorry, I’m so late. Lester just wouldn’t let
me go. We�re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us
out of it if you want. He’s really amazing, this insane old lech. It’s
actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it
is.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Did you eat?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Nah. I’m not hungry. I’m sorry I didn’t call.
It was just, you know, hard to get away.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I was worried.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m sorry. How was your evening?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Tom-Tom’s puncture wound is infected.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: The ferret?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: The iguana.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I dressed the wound. Then I’ve just been
feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah. You want a beer?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: No thanks. I’m going to turn in.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: All right. I’ll be in my workshop for a
little while. I’ll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.
I’ll be in soon. A little while.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: ’kay.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Tell me, Craig, why do you love puppeteering?
Well, Maxine, I’m not sure exactly. Perhaps it’s the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while. Being inside another skin. Moving
differently, thinking differently, feeling differently. Interesting.
Would you like to be inside my skin, Craig? Think what I think? Feel
what I feel? More than anything. Maxine. It’s good in here, Craig.
Better than your wildest dreams.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You’re not someone I could get interested
in. Craig. You play with dolls.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Puppets. Maxine. It’s the idea of being
inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see…</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yikes.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Please, let me explain.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It’s just, and I’ve never done this before,
Maxine, but it’s just that I feel something for you. I’ve never felt
this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you,
Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You might want to check those tarot cards
one more time.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 floor.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love this.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Dr. Lester. . .</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.
Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and
never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that
vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and….</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Ah. yes, the little door. There is a short
film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes.
If you hurry, you’ll just make it.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Put up reel 752.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Hi. Wendy! What’re you up to in this vacant
office.</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I
know it’s against floor policy. and I discovered that there’s a little
tiny door in here. Isn’t it cute? It’s almost like a little dolly’s
door. I wonder what it�s for.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: That’s right, Wendy, it is against floor
policy, but as long as you’re here, let me tell you what I know about
our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was
occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Hmmm. I must have a small store room to store
my merchandise when I am through working on it. I know, I will build a
tiny store room. How cute!</p>
<p><strong>wendy</strong>: Wow! That’s some story, Don.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Truth is stranger than fiction, Wendy!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Whoa! What the hell? Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Holy shit! It’s that actor guy. Shit! What’s
his name? That actor guy! What’s happening? Am I inside him? Am I in his
brain? Am I him? Is he me? Does he know I’m here? My brain is reeling!
Is his brain reeling?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: The puppeteer told me he loves me today. I
know. I can’t think of anything more pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: The Broadhurst Theater, please.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Say, aren’t you that actor guy?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: John Makel…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: John Malkovich! Of course!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Mapplethorpe?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Malkovich!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: John fucking Malkovich!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Yeah. I liked you in that one movie.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: The one where you’re that jewel thief.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I never played a jewel thief.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Who am I thinking of?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: I’m pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get
your autograph now? It’s for …. oh, what the hell, it’s for me! I’m your
biggest fan!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Ahhhh!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Absolutely, doll. I’m just about to close up
here.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Meet you at �The Pig� in twenty minutes. Oh
yeah, maybe I’ll keep my legs closed till then. I’m splitting for the
day. Lock up for me, won’t you, darling.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Don’t you want to know what happened to
me?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: This is important!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: It better be.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: There’s a tiny door in that empty office.
It’s a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the
world through John Malkovich’s eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes,
you’re spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John
Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: He’s an actor. One of the great American
actors of the 20th century.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: What’s he been in?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Lots of things. He’s very well respected.
That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very
odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts
of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence
of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is
duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I
don’t think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There’s only
one thing to do. Let’s get married right away.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yes, of course. He’s a celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Good. We’ll sell tickets.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Tickets to Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: But there’s something profound here, Maxine,
we can’t exploit it.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Fine. I’ll do it myself. I was going to
offer a partnership to you, but this way it’s more money for me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You wanted to be partners with me?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Sure. It’d be fun.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the
world! Illusory nature of existence!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I’ll protect you, Dollface.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Oh. Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous. There is no such thing
as a portal into someone else’s brain.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Brain. soul, I’m telling you, Lotte. I was
right inside him looking out. We’re going to be rich.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I want to try.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow
morning. Plus I’d like to meet this partner of yours.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Well, you know we’re going to be very busy
tomorrow. I’ll tell you what. Let’s do it tonight. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah. We’ll do it right now. On the way to
Lester’s house.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’ll meet you on the turnpike.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Me too, babe.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Holy cow!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh, yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I have to go back.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Okay. Maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I have to go back now.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: We’ll talk about it in the car.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did
something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I
was.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You weren’t you. You were John Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I was, wasn’t I? I was John fucking
Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Tomorrow. We’re late for Lester.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word
I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, be still my heart.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the
restroom?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that
hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It’s sunken, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Dr. Lester…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: More beet-spinach juice, my friend?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No thank you sir. It’s delicious, though. I
just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but
I’m afraid I’m going to have to tender my resignation effectively
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I see. Are you unhappy at our little
company?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No sir, not at all. It’s just that I’m going
to open my own business and…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And what sort of business will this be? If
you don’t mind my asking.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2
actually. In the vacant office. So we’ll still be seeing each other.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: The vacant office. I see. Olive oil.
Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain �doors� which should
never be opened.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: My kingdom for your portal, Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Okay. Here it is. Ever want to be someone
else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen
minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it
in.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Lotte! Why aren’t you at the pet shop?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to
come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this
her?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are
you Craig’s wife?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Yes, Hi.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes.
“Ever want to be someone else?” No, that’s the ad, but let’s talk about
you in a minute. “Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No
kidding…”</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Why aren’t you at work?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’ve been going over and over my experience
last night. It was amazing. I’ve decided I’m a transsexual. Isn’t that
the craziest thing?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What, are you nuts? That’s Oprah talking.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Everything felt right for the first time. I
need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I’m
going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: This is absurd. Besides Feldman’s an
allergist. If you’re going to do something, do it right.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Don’t stand in the way of my actualization as
a man, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Let her go, Craig. I mean �him.”</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah, okay. I’ll pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You better hurry. Traffic.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Davey? Max. Get me John Malkovich’s home
phone? That’s great. Love ya and owe ya.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: So you believe in God… you got something
for it? You worked for all the capitalists. You harvested the fruit from
your labor? You got God!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: What raw, animal power!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: But the past comforts you? The present
smiles on you, yes?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Mr. Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You don’t know me, but I’m a great admirer
of yours.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: How’d you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: It’s just that I fantasize about you and,
well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and…</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh, I like this.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Listen, this is not amusing. Please don’t
call here any…</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: My God! Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
her there. Meet her there. Meet her there…</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet her
there…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I have to go back tonight. At eight
Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Don’t crowd me, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Wow. You were really great in that movie where
you played that retard.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I just wanted to tell you that. And say thank
you. I have a cousin that’s a retard, so, as you can imagine, it means a
lot to me to see retards portrayed on the silver screen so
compassionately.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Maxine!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Hi. I’m so glad you decided to come. I’m
Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m John. I didn’t think I was going to
come, but I felt oddly compelled. I have to admit I was a bit intrigued
by your voice.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: God, she’s beautiful. The way she’s looking
at me. At him. At us.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my
voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’ve never been looked at like this by a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Can I get you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Whatever you’re having.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: So how was it? What was he doing?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around
his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I’m
glad you’re realizing that. You shouldn’t be so quick to assume that
switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You’re right. You know I was thinking that we
should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all.
It might be a nice gesture.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I don’t know. There’s some tension between
us. I’d hate to expose you to that.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: It’ll be okay. I’ll fix my lasagna. We�ll
smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but
fifty words for snow. It’s because they have so much of it.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: After dinner I’ll show you my puppets.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: After that I’ll introduce you to my favorite
monkey, Elijah. He’s got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma.
But we’re getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: The way I see it, the world is divide into
those go after what they want and those who don’t. The passionate ones,
the ones who go after what they want, may not get what they want, but
they remain vital, in touch with themselves, and when they lie on their
deathbeds, they have few regrets. The ones who don’t go after what they
want… well, who gives a shit about them anyway?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Craig, I just don’t find you attractive.
And, Lotte, I’m smitten with you, but only when you’re in Malkovich.
When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out.
Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern
baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew
me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Only to John, sweetie. I’m sorry. Thanks for
a wonderful dinner. No hard feelings, partner.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I want a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Hello, I’m here about the ad.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Please, have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: When you say, I can be somebody else, what
do you mean exactly?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Exactly that. We can put you inside someone
else’s body for fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough
I’ve been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please
say no!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Long term psychic or physiological
repercussions?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: No. Don’t be an ass.</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Can I be anyone I want?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You can be John Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Well that’s perfect. My second choice. Ah,
this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I’m a sad man. Sad and
fat and alone. Oh, I’ve tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a
year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge.
But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor!
Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man
extraordinaire!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Two hundred dollars, please.</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times,
thank you!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Tell your friends.</p>
<p><strong>erroll</strong>: Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends
and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All
of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else,
all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: This is amazing! We’re gonna be rich!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You’re making a big mistake, Schwartz.
Ma’am</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Dr. Lester, I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette.
This is not a toy. I’ve been waiting seventy years to utilize this room,
grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying
tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping,
Schwartz, worshipping properly.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I am not alone. There are others. We are
legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Crackpot.</p>
<p><strong>disciples of malkovich</strong>: How much do we love you? We
loved you in “Making Mr. Right.” That is how much we love you. We even
own the director’s cut on laser disc. Please accept us into your head as
we have accepted you into our hearts. Please let us be you. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: May I have your attention, please. We have a
new disciple among us tonight.</p>
<p><strong>disciples of malkovich</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: She is the wife of Schwartz.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m getting divorced.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: No you mustn’t, my child.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: But why, Son of Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: We need you on the inside, my child. To
report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to… destroy him… …for
lack of a better word.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m moving. Remember? What’s with the hooded
cloak?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Nothing. Don’t go, Craig. I’ve been thinking.
Let’s try to work this out. We’ve got so much history.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You should feed your animals. They’re looking
peaked.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m getting rid of the fucking animals.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m getting rid of the animals. I’ve lost
interest. Besides, they’re standing between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No they’re not.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You’ve always hated the animals.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You’ve always loved the animals.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m giving them up. I’ve changed. I’ve found
a new focus.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Us, of course.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Oh, Lot…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What about Maxine?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Fuck Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: We wish.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I have to see you. Can you call him and
invite us over?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Give me one hour to get inside him
Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Thanks so much for coming over.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Oh, I’m really glad you called.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: So, do you enjoy being an actor?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Oh sure. It’s very rewarding…</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I love you, Lotte.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Maxine…</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m sorry, did you just call me
“Lotte”?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: No, I guess not. I’m an actor.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yes, Maxine, yes.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: This is too good to be true.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You were him last night, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: And he was with her.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: We love her, Craig. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Me and John.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Don’t forget me.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Well, you have the Maxine action figure to
play with.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m sorry. That was nasty.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Life is confusing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Sometimes we’re forced to make hard
decisions. I’d like for us to stay together, Craig. You know,
platonically, if that’s possible. I truly value our friendship.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I feel that somehow my parents never prepared
me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could
they know? Today’s world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now.
I’m sorry, Lotte. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Are you torturing me on purpose?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I’ve fallen in love.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I don’t think so. I’ve fallen in love. This
is what people who’ve fallen in love look like.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad
for the skin.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You’re evil, Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Do you have any idea what its like to have
two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same
pair of eyes? No I don’t suppose you would. It’s quite a thrill,
Craig.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Yes, my dear?</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Someone names A Lot of Warts on line
two.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Thank you, Floris.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Think, Jew florist?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Good morning, Lotte!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Dr. Lester, everything’s falling apart.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I blew it, Dr. Lester.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You followed your heart, my child, and that
is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: But now we’ve lost access to Craig.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: My child, I don’t think its a great mystery
what Craig’s up to.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to
cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Suck my dick!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Tell her you need to see her.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You bastard.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can
be.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I have to see you.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Sweetie! Oh, but we can’t. It’s business
hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying
customers.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Tell her, what the hell, close early today,
live dangerously.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: What the hell, darling. Close early today,
live dangerously.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oooh, doll. I love this new devil-may-care
side of you. Alrighty, I’ll track down Lover-boy, and I’ll see both of
you in one hour. Exactamundo.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Help! He’s locking me in a cage!</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>parrot</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Lesson number one: Be careful what you teach
your parrot.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Tommy, can I take fifteen?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oh, Lotte… Oh, sweetie…</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Maxine…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I can’t believe it. This is too good to be
true.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You’re glowing again.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: A girl has a right to glow if she wants.
It’s in the fucking constitution.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my
dear. I’d never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her
actual tits for that matter. If only, I’ve been thinking to myself, if
only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see
what he sees… And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms,
his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: It’ll never happen, fuckface.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Ah, but you’re forgetting one thing,
Lambchop.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m a puppeteer.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Lotte, this is so good…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Move right hand across her left breast now.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her
left breast now.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Holy shit, yes!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Holy shit, yes!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Holy shit! He said what I said!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Holy shit! He said what I said!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Lotte? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck
is going on? I’m not talking. This is not me!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oh, Lotte…</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Something was making me talk. Some
Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for
me taking hold.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: No, Dollface, I know what my passion
taking hold feels like. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm across
your girlfriend’s glorious tit. I made him talk. And, oh, there was the
beginning of sensation in the fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It’s just a matter
of practice before Malkovich becomes nothing more than another puppet
hanging next to my worktable. Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: It’s like nothing I’ve ever felt before.
I think I’m going crazy.</p>
<p><strong>kevin bacon</strong>: I’m sure you’re not going crazy.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Kevin, I’m telling you… it was like
nothing I’ve…</p>
<p><strong>kevin bacon</strong>: Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were
you stoned?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yes, but you see, someone else was
talking through my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>kevin bacon</strong>: You were stoned. Case closed. End of
story. How hot is this babe?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I think it might’ve been this Lotte woman
talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.</p>
<p><strong>kevin bacon</strong>: Ouch. Now that’s hot. She’s using you
to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you’re done with
her. This is my type of chick.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m done with her now. Tonight really
creeped me out.</p>
<p><strong>kevin bacon</strong>: You’re crazy to let go of a chick who
calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I don’t know anything about her. What if
she’s some sort of witch or something?</p>
<p><strong>kevin bacon</strong>: All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian
Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I gotta know the truth, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>kevin bacon</strong>: The truth is for suckers,
Johnny-Boy.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Excuse me, what type of service does this
company provide?</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: You get to be John Malkovich for fifteen
minutes. Two hundred clams.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: No cutting, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: No cutting!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hey! Break it up! Break it up! Everybody gets
a chance to be…</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: It’s him! Oh, we’re so sorry Mr. Malkovich!
I hope me and my associates from Overeaters Anonymous didn’t hurt you
too terribly.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Inside.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I
can explain. We operate a little business her that… simulates, for our
clientele, the experience of… being you, actually.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Simulates?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Sure, after a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Let me try.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You? Why I’m sure it would pale in comparison
to the actual experience.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Let me try!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Let him try.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich.
Compliments of the house.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What happens when a man climbs through his
own portal?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: How the hell would I know? I wasn’t a
philosophy major.</p>
<p><strong>girl malkovich</strong>: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich…</p>
<p><strong>waiter malkovich</strong>: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>girl malkovich</strong>: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>waiter malkovich</strong>: Malkovich Malkovich.
Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Malkovich!</p>
<p><strong>waiter malkovich</strong>: Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>singing malkovich</strong>: Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
Malkovich…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: So how was it?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: That… was… no… simulation.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I know. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I have been to the dark side. I have seen
a world that no man should ever see.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Really? For most people it’s a rather
pleasant experience. What exactly did you…</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: This portal is mine and must be sealed up
forever. For the love of God.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: With all respect, sir, I discovered that
portal. Its my livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: It’s my head, Schwartz, and I’ll see you
in court!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: And who’s to say I won’t be seeing what
you’re seeing… in court?</p>
<p><strong>motorist</strong>: Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Once this was a relationship based on love.
Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim
to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You fell in love with her first.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah but I didn’t do anything about it. Out
of respect for our marriage.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You didn’t do anything about it out of
respect for the fact that she wouldn’t let you near her with a ten foot
pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I
become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in
my heart.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Maybe this is what you’ve always been, Craig,
you just never faced it before.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Perhaps you’re right. I can’t let you go
though. Too much has happened. You’re my ace in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I need a shower.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m sorry. Oh God, I’m sorry. I’m some kind
of monster. I’m the guy you read about in the paper and go, “he’s some
kind of monster.”</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You’re not a monster, Craig. Just a confused
man.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: But I gotta go now. I’ve got to go be
Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: J.M. Inc. Be all that someone…</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: We have to meet.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: One hour.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’ll tell you all about it when I get
home.</p>
<p><strong>safari man</strong>: Well, there monkeys ain’t going nowhere.
Let’s get us a couple a brews ’fore the boss comes back…</p>
<p><strong>chimp one</strong>: Son, untie your mother and me! Quickly!
Before the great bald chimp-men return.</p>
<p><strong>chimp two</strong>: Hurry, Elijah!</p>
<p><strong>safari man</strong>: Why you little bastard!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Maxine! Listen: It hasn’t been me in John the
last three times. Craig’s had me locked up in the apartment. He made me
call you at gunpoint. It’s been him! Oh, God, it’s been him!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Really? Well, you know, he’s quite good. I’m
surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend.
I’ll speak with you soon.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: But Maxine, I thought it was me you
loved.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I thought so too, doll. I guess we were
mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Hello, Dr. Lester?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I can explain about the portal, darling.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Don’t con me, Maxine. We’re over. I just
let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I’m taking you
and Schwartz to court.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in
there?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yes. How did you know it was me?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Lotte called me.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Oh, so the bitch escaped.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Apparently you can control this Malkovich
fellow now.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m getting better all the time.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I’ll say you are. Let’s do it on his kitchen
table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: No… damn… you… Oh shut up, you overrated
sack of shit.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You know I think it pays to leave
juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my
dear.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you
that I find that highly arousing.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: No, you don’t understand. I’ve been inside
Malkovich when I’m with Maxine…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are
supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich
by yourself!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: No, I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, didn’t anyone show you the
indoctrination video?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, sorry. Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>lester on film</strong>: Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians. As
you may already know, today a baby was born into this sad world.</p>
<p><strong>lester on film</strong>: His name is John Horatio Hannibal
Malkovich. And we are the keepers of the door to his soul. One day, when
his brain is big enough, we will all journey into his head and live
there for all eternity. Following the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
we will build the ultimate communist community, one body and hundreds,
maybe thousands, of brains inside working together to form a super human
intellect capable of curing disease, stopping all war, and ruling the
world with a benevolent fist. We will take a wife, a woman of uncommon
beauty and intellect, who is, as yet, still an infant herself.</p>
<p><strong>lester on film</strong>: Her name is Floris Horatia
Hannibella DeMent.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Does Floris know that she’s the chosen?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, I tried to explain it to her, but…</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You still there, sweets?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Yeah. I’ve figured out how to hold on as
long as I want. Oddly enough, it’s all in the wrists.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig
honey.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: You mean with Malkovich?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I’d love to see your work.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Really? Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’ll do something I call “Craig’s Dance
of Despair and Disillusionment.”</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: That was incredible. You’re brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: You see, Maxine, it isn’t just playing
with dolls.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You’re right, my darling, it’s so much more.
It’s playing with people!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Stay in him forever?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: No! But how will we make a living, my
love, if our clientele doesn’t have access to our product?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Well, we’ll have all the money in
Malkovich’s bank account, plus he still gets acting work
occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: No! Please! Shut up, will you? We’re
trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that
about it.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: No one would ever have to know its not
him.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
What if we presented Malkovich as the world’s most complicated puppet
and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We’d wipe
the floor with the Great Mantini!</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oh, Craiggy, that’s brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I have sinned, unwittingly, against the
community. And for this I am truly sorry.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: W-w-what’s it like on the inside?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh, it’s glorious. It’s indescribable.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say it’s
time.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Perhaps you’re right, Terry. We’re all
prepared, and perhaps this Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand a bit. We
will enter the portal tonight!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: It’s okay, my sweet.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Aaaahhhh, the portal!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: No! Don’t harm the vessel!</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: It’s Craig in there, I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I understand, but we must protect the vessel
at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what
is rightfully ours.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Squatter’s rights, Lester.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Now excuse us, we have an entertainment
legend to create.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Clear the way for them, my friends. They
will be dealt with in due time.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Now, let’s see what we can do to salvage
this portal… for the sake of all that is good.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Of course, send him right in. Don’t ever keep
him waiting again. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt
at reception.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: This is my fiancee Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about the
cunt at reception. Please have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Teresa, get me a chicken soup. Chicken
soup?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’ll get right to the point, Larry. I’m a
puppet now…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m being controlled by the world’s
greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Oh yeah, he’s good.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: … and I want to show off his skills by
performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Vegas. Can you arrange that?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Sure, sure. Just let me make a couple of
calls.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: That’s the last of it, boss.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, let’s see what we’ve got here.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: My God, where am I? This seems so
familiar.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: My God, I’m Hitler in the bunker! Aaaahhhh!
Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Cut!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, I’m just the actor in that Twilight Zone
episode.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Thank you all for your efforts, but I’m
afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Why not? I need to get in there!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m not certain, my dear, but I believe your
husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: That bastard! I’ll gladly dispose of him in
the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m afraid that no physical harm must come
to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: Oooh, I got an idea! What if we build
another portal to Malkovich, like around back, and sneak in that
way?</p>
<p><strong>man #4</strong>: Only Captain Mertin knew how to build a
portal, dummy, and he’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Actually, my friends, I suppose its time I
told you, I’m Captain James Mertin.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You see, Lester is an anagram for
Mertin.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It used to work, I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: How can this be? I thought you were only one
hundred and five years old. Mertin would have to be…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m two hundred and five, truth be told.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: You don’t look a day over one hundred and
five, Captain. What’s your secret?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and
a deal with the Devil.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: So what exactly are you saying? Are we in
cahoots with the Dark Master here?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Surprise.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Wait! It’s not that bad! When we get into
Malkovich, we still get to rule the world, just like I told you. The
only difference is that we rule in the name of evil, instead of
good.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: That’s the only difference?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: So anyway…</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Well, I for one, am resigning. I will not
serve evil. I am ashamed of all of you.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: My dear, let me assure you that when we
attain power, it will be much more pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
than for those outside.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Do we get to wear a crown?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: But of course.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Good. I think its time to beckon
Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I
didn’t anticipate this.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And as I said, sir, we can’t very well exert
physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Right, Lester. I heard you the first time.
I’m not a dummy.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Didn’t mean to imply that you were, sir.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Look, I’m going back to my house to ponder
this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz’s comings and goings. Oh,
and somebody dispose of Schwartz’s wife, will you? Nice to meet you
all.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh, my friends. Be thankful you’re not human.
People are treacherous and greedy and corrupt. I’ve lost my heart to two
of them and I almost lost my soul to another. And I’m no better. Look at
the way I keep you, locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. Well, I’ve
been in a cage too, my friends. Literally and figuratively. So tonight I
set you free.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Good-bye, friends.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Hello, friend</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: They’ve come to kill me, Elijah. See, I know
too much. I should get the door. It’s impolite to keep death
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: This is it, lover. You’re stepping onto that
stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you’re coming back the greatest
puppeteer the world has ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m nervous. Malkovich is fighting me
hard today.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Doesn’t he know how important tonight is to
us?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: He’s a selfish bastard.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, it is the great
privilege of the Luxor hotel and Casino to present Craig Schwartz and
his magical puppet John Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Blasphemous bastard.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Pretty good though.</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren’t expecting you
tonight, sir. Um, I’m afraid there’s not an empty seat in the entire
house.</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Make one empty.</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: Y-y-y-es sir.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Not too shabby.</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: They’re going to take over the world, Elijah.
Evil will reign. But, then, evil already reigns, doesn’t it? So what
difference does it make if John Malkovich is wearing the fucking crown
while it’s reigning?</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s just me, boss. I brought
croissants.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this
Malkovich thing.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: We saw his show at the Luxor last night.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Vegas? What’d you think?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: The kid’s got talent. You’ve never seen
Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing.
Impressions.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Impressions? Those are hard.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we
can’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I
don’t know. That’s the best I can think of right now.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: A scary dream?</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
dream.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I like that.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: They love me, darling! “Craig Schwartz is
fantastic!” The New York Times. “If only Craig Schwartz had always been
inside Malkovich!” Women’s Wear Daily. “Craig Schwartz - The world’s
greatest puppeteer!” Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Oh, darling. It’s a dream come true. We’re
going to ride this straight to the top.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Sleepy suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don’t
you climb into bed, and I’ll meet you there in just…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: I am the Devil.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Leave Malkovich. He is mine.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Okay. Sorry. I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Bad dream, darling?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’ve got to leave Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I just had the most horrifying nightmare.
The devil was in it.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can’t back
out because of some stupid dream.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Honey, we can be happy and poor
together.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Perhaps you’ll want to consult that Ouija
board again.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yeah what?!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Derek Mantini!</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Did you see the reviews?</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Yeah, I saw them</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Because if you missed any, I just happen
to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: I’m Maxine. I produced the evening with
Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Very impressive. I could use a producer
with your vision. And other outstanding attributes.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: She’s not available.</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: We’ll see, Schwartz. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Yeah, we’ll see, Schwartz. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: I won’t waste your time Schwartz, or more
importantly, mine. Here’s my proposal: There’s only room in this world
for one “World’s Greatest Puppeteer.” Correct? So let’s allow the
puppet-going public to crown their king.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: How do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: A friendly competition, if you will. Your
Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each
other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving
of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to
obscurity as a file clerk.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: What’s the play?</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Say… “Equus”? It’s got everything.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Broadway’s finest three hours. It’s about
the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern
society.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Sounds boring. Are there any songs?</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Nothing but acting to hide behind,
buddy-boy.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m not afraid. I toured for a year with
the National Puppet Company’s production of “Long Day’s Journey Into
Night.”</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: Great then.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Is there dancing?</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Who needs dancing?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: How’d it go? Did you say the philodendron
gets water or no?</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: No, for God’s sake, I just watered it
yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but
circumstances arose.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What kind of circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Maxine says she’ll leave him if he leaves
Malkovich, plus he’s been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: The Great Mantini?</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the
Great Mantini!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, he’s good! Great, actually. I saw him do
“Tru” with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: But I think I have another plan.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Do tell. I love a good plan.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Why are you being like this?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I missed you. I’m sorry. Tell me the
plan.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave
Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini’s performance a
bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Can you do that? I mean, do you know
anything about puppetry?</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
handle it.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I was just asking. No disrespect
intended.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Fine. Let’s drop it.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Fine. I mean, it’s not like I was doubting
you, it’s just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to
acquire.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Fine. I’m not mad. Let’s just drop it.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Fine. Your mail’s on the kitchen table.
Mostly junk. Oh, there’s a letter from Alex Trebek.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: You’ve got to tell Craig what’s going on. He
must never leave Malkovich.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m glad you learned sign language, Elijah,
but I’m tired of your nagging. I’m tired of this conversation. I’m tired
period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel
personally responsible for saving it?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: It is better to light one candle than curse
the darkness. I learned that from you.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: What have I become?</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: Do you dream often?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: It’s my job to ask the
questions. Yours to answer them.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: Says me. Do you dream
often?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Keep your eyes in your pants, old timer.</p>
<p><strong>theatergoer #1</strong>: That Truman puppet is downright
boring as the psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>theatergoer #2</strong>: It’s a wooden performance, really.
Get it? Wooden?</p>
<p><strong>theatergoer #3</strong>: What’s with the Malkovich puppet? He
was much better in Vegas when he played the piano with his feet.</p>
<p><strong>theatergoer #4</strong>: I hate it when they try to stretch.
It’s like Woody Allen.</p>
<p><strong>theatergoer #5</strong>: They both stink! I’m going across
the street to second act Miss Saigon.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: You’d better turn on the pyrotechnics,
lover, ’cause right now you’re running neck and neck with the dead
president. And you’re both in last place.</p>
<p><strong>charles nelson reilly</strong>: You’re doing beautifully, my
boy. I wept at the speech about your wife.</p>
<p><strong>charles nelson reilly</strong>: What the hell?
Nyong-nyong!</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: I can hear the creature’s
voice. It’s calling me out of the black cave of the Psyche. I shove in
my dim little torch, and there he stands – waiting for me. He raises his
matted head. He opens his great, square teeth and says ‘Why? … Why me? …
Why – ultimately – Me? … Do you really imagine you can account for Me?
Totally, infallibly, inevitably account for Me? … Poor Dr. Dysart!’</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Eyes! … White eyes – never closed! Eyes
like flames – coming – coming! … God seest! … God seest! … NO!</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: Here … Here … Sssh … Sssh …
Calm now … Lie back. Just lie back! Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In …
Out … In … Out … That’s it … In. Out .. In … Out …</p>
<p><strong>audience member</strong>: That Malkovich puppet is a damn
fine actor.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Bastard is stealing my thunder.</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: All right! I’ll take it
away! He’ll be delivered from madness. What then? He’ll feel himself
acceptable! What then?</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: I’ll heal the rash on his
body. I’ll erase the welts cut into his body by flying manes.</p>
<p><strong>harry s. truman puppet</strong>: You won’t gallop anymore,
Alan. Horses will be quite safe. You’ll save your pennies every week,
till you can change that scooter into a car…</p>
<p><strong>actual truman</strong>: Where am I? Aren’t I dead? Vote for
Mantini!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Good-bye, Maxine.</p>
<p><strong>maxine</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I’m back! My nightmare is over.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: Okay, now!</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I am your earthly king! Kneel before
me!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Greetings, my lowly subjects.</p>
<p><strong>floris</strong>: Great things, my lonely subtext?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Boy, be careful what you wish for. Never
mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride, will you?</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: I am bored. You will dance for your king
now.</p>
<p><strong>malkovich</strong>: Faster! Faster, my little trained
monkeys!</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Must you take this terrible demon on
yourself, my love?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Yes. I’m the only one. I have to enter
Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: If there was any way I could go in your
place. But I’m only a monkey and…</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Hush, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’ll be with you always, my friends. Who
knows, maybe if I’m lucky, I’ll rejoin you with wings and a beak.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a
halo.</p>
<p><strong>parrot</strong>: Good-bye. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: My God!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m so glad you’re safe. You look really
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’m in love. For the first time. It’s funny,
but when it happens to you, there’s no question.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: He’s a lucky man. Do I know him?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: It’s Elijah.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: The iguana?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: The monkey.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Oh, right. As long as you’re happy. I’m sure
he’s a better lover than I ever was.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: A better friend.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m sorry for everything.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: It’s okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an
odd sort of way.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You came up here looking for the portal?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Yeah. I was going to kill him from the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: And yourself too in the process. God, you’re
so beautiful. Why couldn’t I see that before?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: You saw it once. Now you see it again. That’s
life, isn’t it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy
bastards. So now it’s all over, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I don’t know. There’s a small community of
us. We have a place they don’t know about. We’re happy. We’ll keep
trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You’ll have me, after all I’ve done to
you?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: People make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m through with puppets, Lotte. I just want
you to know that.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’d like to be a farmer. I want to help
things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a
farmer?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Sure. We could really use a farmer. We’d be
grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn’t mind too
terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to
lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn’t mind too terribly.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Oh honey. It’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I love you, Lotte.</p>
<p><strong>mantini</strong>: I can’t wait to see where you and your
friends live, Lotte.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: It’s beautiful, Craig, like Eden.</p>
<p><strong>flemmer</strong>: One serpent, coming up.</p>
