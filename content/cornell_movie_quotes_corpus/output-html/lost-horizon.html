<p><strong>lost horizon</strong>: Written by Robert previous hit
Riskin</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: Over the titles we see SUPERIMPOSED the
snow-capped mountains leading to Shangri-La.</p>
<p><strong>1. long shot</strong>: The field is aflare with floodlights -
on one side is an office building - on the other are hangars. The whole
field is filled with Chinese refugees running around wildly. An Army
transport is in front of the office building, motors going.</p>
<p><strong>2. reverse shot</strong>: Showing in the distance, probably
several miles away, the effect of a burning city, which is Baskul. Over
the shot we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire. In the f.g., we see
the silhouetted figures of Chinese running away from Baskul and toward
the Camera, their personal packs on their backs.</p>
<p><strong>3. med. close shot</strong>: Toward office building. Conway
comes out of the building, followed by a small group of white people
with frightened faces. They have to fight their way through a horde of
milling Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>4. medium shot</strong>: As Conway and group finally reach
the plane where Conway forces the white people in. In this he is aided
by his brother, George, a young and vigorous Englishman. The pilot
sticks his head out of the cockpit.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Conway, we can’t take more than seven!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All right. I’m sorry. There will be another
plane in a minute. All right - go on.</p>
<p><strong>5. long shot</strong>: Motors roar, and the plane starts to
move, scattering those of the Chinese who were unfortunately too close
to the ship. Conway and George rush back into the office building.</p>
<p><strong>6. full shot</strong>: There are about thirty white refugees,
men, women and several children. They all lift their panicky faces to
Conway and George as they enter. A barrage of questions are flung at
them.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: Are there any more planes? Do you think the
bandits will come here? Please take my wife next, Mr. Conway!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Wait, wait! Everybody, wait! There are
plenty of planes coming. Now everybody have patience. Everything will be
all right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You have nothing to worry about. Leave
everything to my brother.</p>
<p><strong>7. medium shot</strong>: As Conway enters to speak to
operator.</p>
<p><strong>radio operator</strong>: Yes, sir - with seven passengers
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>radio speaker</strong>: Seven passengers? Good.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Get me Shanghai.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’m talking to them now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>radio speaker</strong>: Hello. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Conway speaking. Is Colonel Marsh there?</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s voice</strong>: Right here, Conway. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>8. close shot</strong>: As Conway continues into mike.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Colonel, I need more planes. I’ve still
about twenty people to get out. Where are those planes you promised
us?</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s voice</strong>: We sent everything we could find,
Conway.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: They better get here soon or I can’t be
responsible�</p>
<p><strong>9. wider angle</strong>: As George rushes in.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob! I think I hear motors!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here
now! Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when
they get here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: And be sure that none of the natives get
in.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hello? Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s voice</strong>: Hello, Conway. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Thanks - and take care of that liver of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s voice</strong>: Oh, ho - my word!</p>
<p><strong>10. full shot</strong>: As Conway enters.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All right, get ready everybody. The planes
are here.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: One at a time. Children first. Where are
they? Come on now, and stand over here.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Where’s the mother?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: They’re orphans, Mr. Conway.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I see. All right. Well, you come - right
over here - and you, and you� �come on�</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What about us, Mr. Conway?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Gentlemen, please wait your turn.</p>
<p><strong>11. close shot</strong>: A girl slouched in a corner. We meet
Gloria Stone, a surly, wan-looking prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: You’d better take some of those squealing
men with you first. They might faint on you. I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>12. close shot - conway</strong>: Something of a smile
crosses his face.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Just as you say!</p>
<p><strong>13. full shot</strong>: All the lights go out. Everybody
starts screaming.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Whoa! Don’t lose your heads now - I’ll see
what it is.</p>
<p><strong>14. close shot at door</strong>: Conway rushing out, meets
George coming back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The power house - they’ve blown it up! The
planes can’t land without lights.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Come on! We’ll burn the hangar. That will
make light for them!</p>
<p><strong>15. medium shot</strong>: As they run through the screaming
mob toward the hangar.</p>
<p><strong>16. full shot</strong>: It is filled with Chinese refugees
clinging to their household goods. Conway and George enter. Conway
speaks to them in Chinese, ordering them out. Some hesitate, and they
have to push the terror-stricken waiting coolies out. When they have all
left, Conway opens the spigots of several gasoline tanks, waits for the
fuel to spill on the ground, then tosses a lantern on the fuel, igniting
a blaze. At the same moment, he and George dash for the door.</p>
<p><strong>17. long shot</strong>: Conway and George rush out of hangar.
When they are at a fairly safe distance, the building bursts into
flames.</p>
<p><strong>18. long shot</strong>: Against a background of the burning
hangar, a plane is just leaving the ground, as another one is
landing.</p>
<p><strong>19. medium shot</strong>: Of Conway, signalling.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All right, go ahead! We go on to the next
plane. Bring out any people that are left.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>20. reverse angle - long shot</strong>: Shooting toward the
burning city of Baskul in the distance. We see the bandits coming,
flashing bayonets, in pursuit of screaming refugees.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hello, Fenner.</p>
<p><strong>fenner</strong>: Hello, Conway. Having a little trouble?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You never mind me. Get this gadget off the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob, these are all that are left.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Come on! Quick! This way.</p>
<p><strong>22. med. shot at plane</strong>: When Conway and others
approach, George helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway faces the mob,
punching at those who try to wedge their way forward. Finally one of
them manages to get his foot on the step, and Conway pushes him
violently.</p>
<p><strong>23. close shot - man</strong>: Who staggers back and falls,
sprawling. As he hits the ground, he yells:</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You can’t leave me here, you blighter. I’m a
British subject!</p>
<p><strong>24. medium shot</strong>: Conway looks his surprise and lifts
him off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>25. close shot - a chinaman</strong>: Glaring off toward
Conway, picks up a board and starts toward Conway.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look out, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>27. medium shot</strong>: A shadowy figure materializes in
the cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind. He shoves Fenner aside and
takes his place.</p>
<p><strong>28. medium shot</strong>: Conway pushes George up and starts
to mount himself. He looks off - and what he sees startles him.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All right, Fenner! Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>29. long shot</strong>: Of what Conway sees. Several trucks
loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms - come tearing up the road -
come to a stop. Some fire toward plane - others are setting up machine
guns. Droves of refugees scramble to cover.</p>
<p><strong>30. full shot</strong>: Already present are Barnard, an
American; Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett, whom we saw dressed
as a Chinese. Conway slams the door shut - looks off - then cries:</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Get down on the floor, everybody. Go ahead,
Fenner!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fenner, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>31. med. close shot</strong>: Of the new pilot setting the
controls and lifting the plane into flight.</p>
<p><strong>32. long shot</strong>: As the plane swings around - taxies
crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied by gunfire of the
bandits.</p>
<p><strong>33. full shot</strong>: The occupants are still on the floor.
Conway rises and glances out of a window, warily.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, I guess we’re out of range. Everybody
all right?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Whew! That was close.</p>
<p><strong>34. medium shot</strong>: Conway starts for the back seat and
suddenly sees Lovett.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’m Alexander P. Lovett, sir.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Why aren’t you registered through our
office?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It would serve you right if you were left
behind.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: How could I know that a war was going to
break out right over my head! Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell
you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to
get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Where were you hiding?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the
interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly�</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I know - and a war broke out right over your
head.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The next time you’re in wild country like
this, keep in touch with the British Consul.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Aha - very good, Freshie. Very good. You’d
better put his name on the list and make out a report later.</p>
<p><strong>35. med. close shot - the two</strong>: Barnard and
Lovett.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I beg your pardon, brother. What did you
say you were hunting?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Fossils.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Fossils, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’m a paleontologist.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: A paleontologist.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I have here a discovery that will startle
the world. It’s the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium, found in
Asia.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Well, what do you know about that!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Found in Asia!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: When I get home I shall probably be knighted
for it.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Knighted! You don’t say. Do you mind if I
take a look at it?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>insert: of box</strong>: Wrapped carefully in absorbent
cotton is something that resembles a dry chicken bone.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene:</strong>: Barnard reaches for the box, but
Lovett pulls it away from him.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: This is the only thing I was able to save
when those heathens surrounded me.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able
to reconstruct the entire skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted
for finding that soupbone?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium -
found in Asia.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Yeah, I remember. You said that before.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never
got beyond the mesozoic era.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Ah, poor fellow.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Yes, it just shows� I don’t know why I’m
talking to you. I don’t know you. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Okay, brother.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Don’t call me brother.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Okay, sister. No offense. No offense!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I say, will you have a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Say, you’re an American, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest
of your playmates? Let me alone!</p>
<p><strong>37. full shot</strong>: All is silent for a moment. Conway is
writing on a small pad - which he rests on an uplifted knee. George is
rummaging through a closet - rear of the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>38. med. shot - george and conway</strong>: Conway still
writes, undisturbed. George reaches into the closet and emerges with a
bottle of whiskey. His face lights up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello! Look what I found!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just what I needed too.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just this once, Bob. I feel like
celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to
take you back to England. You know what it means. Here you are. Don’t
bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me. Gentlemen, I
give you Robert Conway - England’s new Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hurray!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How I’m going to bask in reflected
glory!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Don’t talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s why they’re sending for you, Bob.
With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen. They need
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, you can laugh if you want to. But
who else can they get? Who else is there in all of England half the
fighter, half the diplomat, who</p>
<p><strong>39. close shot of conway</strong>: We find Conway, asleep in
his seat, his head on his hands. George approaches and tenderly spreads
a jacket over his shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out
yet?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Did you say we saved ninety white
people?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten
thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn’t say
that. They don’t count.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’d better try to get some sleep, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Just you wait until I’m Foreign Secretary.
Can’t you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little
Foreign Secretaries? You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the
other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can’t get it
with smooth talk, you send an army in. I’m going to fool them, Freshie.
I’m not going to have an army. I’m going to disband mine. I’m going to
sink my battleships - I’m going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then
when the enemy approaches we’ll say, “Come in, gentlemen - what can we
do for you?” So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And
what will they think, Freshie? They’ll think to themselves -
“Something’s wrong here. We’ve been duped. This is not according to
form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot
them?” Then they’ll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole
thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants� �and I’ll be
slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’d better not drink any more, Bob. You’re
not talking sense.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Don’t worry, George. Nothing’s going to
happen. I’ll fall right into line. I’ll be the good little boy that
everybody wants me to be. I’ll be the best little Foreign Secretary we
ever had, just because I haven’t the nerve to be anything else.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do try to sleep, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing,
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Did you ever notice the sunrise in China,
George? Ah, you should. It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>40. long shot of cabin</strong>: It is quiet. All are asleep.
CAMERA MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches the glass panel leading to
the cockpit. The pilot’s face turns. Instead of Fenner we see a strange,
Mongolian face - with sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays across
his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>41. long shot of plane</strong>: Flying at high speed against
a moonlit sky. We stay on the shot until it vanishes, a mere speck, over
the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>42. long shot</strong>: The morning sun peeks over a mountain
top. From the same direction, as if arriving with the sun, the ship
looms up, and comes roaring toward us.</p>
<p><strong>43. full shot</strong>: All are asleep except Lovett, who
fidgets on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens his eyes - and
stretches. As he does so, he sees that Lovett is awake.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Good morning, Lovey.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I say, good morning, Lovey.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Good morning� Look here, young man.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Eh?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I didn’t care for ‘sister’ last night, and I
don’t like ‘Lovey’ this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Well, it’s a good morning, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’m never conversational before I
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say,
we’re supposed to be travelling east, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Why, of course. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Well, it looks to me as if we’re travelling
west.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It certainly is.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Look here�</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Any child knows how to tell direction. Any
child. I don’t care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in
the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and
your left hand is the south�</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I always get it twisted because I’m
left-handed.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand
is� What difference does it make what ‘hand’ you are? The north is the
north!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in
the east, and we’re going away from it.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Now you’re irritating and absurd!</p>
<p><strong>44. close shot - lovett</strong>: As he sulks by himself,
looks around - locates the sun in back of him - smiles - satisfied he’s
right, throws a condescending glance over at Barnard - then suddenly his
face clouds - the whole thing dawns on him.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh, my word - of course - yes. Boy! Boy,
we’re travelling in the wrong direction! Wake up! We’re going in the
wrong direction!</p>
<p><strong>45. full shot</strong>: Conway is still asleep.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Couldn’t you arrange to make a little less
noise?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I tell you, we’re going west, and Shanghai
is east of here!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Be quiet! Fenner’s the best pilot in China.
He knows what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It’s Fenner.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: He might have lost his way.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Of course. That’s what I told them last
night. You can’t expect a man to sail around in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, all right. Calm yourself. I’ll
talk to Fenner.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fenner! I - I say�</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob! Bob!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wake up! Something’s happened! It isn’t
Fenner in the cockpit!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, stop it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a
Mongolian, or something.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: We’re nowhere near Shanghai. We’re going in
the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: We’re over the desert. That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>46. group shot - around cockpit</strong>: Conway pounds on
the panel. The face of the pilot appears in sight. Conway tries to ask
him something in Chinese. The pilot glares at them for a second, then a
gun is shoved out at them. Instinctively they back away.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Charming chap.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, that’s that, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Wonder what’s happened to Fenner.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Yes. And who is he ? How’d he get there?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Do you suppose we stopped someplace during
the night and changed pilots?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: No. That’s not possible! If we had landed,
we all would have been awakened.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Of course. We never left the air. I know - I
didn’t sleep the whole night long.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That fellow got on at Baskul.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: What’s he doing? Where’s he taking us? He
may be a maniac for all we know.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m going to drag him out and force him to
tell us what his game is.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: What if he refuses?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: We’ll smash his face in. That’s what we’ll
do.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, George, that’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I guess we’re in for it.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: In for what?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I don’t know. He must have had some purpose
in taking the plane away from Fenner. When he lands, we’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: You mean to tell me you’re not going to do
anything until we land?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: What do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Why, you - you� Look here - he may dash us
to pieces!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It might afford you a great deal of relief.
Now gentlemen, I’m going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a
peaceful dream. As soon as he lands, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>48. close shot - george</strong>: He stares out of the window
and is suddenly startled.</p>
<p><strong>49. long shot</strong>: Of the plane with its nose turned
downward in a sharp descent.</p>
<p><strong>50. medium shot</strong>: George is on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’re heading down! We’re going to land!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob, we’re landing! Bob, we’re coming to a
village!</p>
<p><strong>51. medium shot</strong>: Plane starting toward ground. All
we can see are mountain tops.</p>
<p><strong>52. medium shot</strong>: They all stare out of the windows.
Conway peers intently.</p>
<p><strong>53. long shot</strong>: From angle in cabin of plane. Through
the window, directly below we see a large open space at the foot of the
hills. The plane is headed for it.</p>
<p><strong>54. long shot</strong>: We see a swarm of strange-looking
natives, scantily attired, but bearing bayonets, running toward the
plane.</p>
<p><strong>55. medium close shot</strong>: Of George and Conway, as the
ship hits the ground, bouncing and swaying perilously.</p>
<p><strong>56. medium shot</strong>: As the plane taxies across the
uninhabited space.</p>
<p><strong>57. med. close shot at door</strong>: Conway and George ready
to get out. As Conway turns to open the door, he looks off and is
startled by something he sees. George follows his gaze, and a bewildered
expression comes into his eyes, too.</p>
<p><strong>58. long shot</strong>: Shooting through door. The
strange-looking natives have surrounded the plane and are closing
in.</p>
<p><strong>59. medium shot</strong>: Conway and George both
instinctively wheel around toward the opposite side. But from that
direction too, a horde of natives dash toward them. Conway hesitates a
second, and like a flash springs for the door. But he stops again, as he
opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>60. medium shot</strong>: To include door of plane. Conway
finds himself staring into the threatening mouths of half a dozen
rifles, and quickly shuts the door.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What are these people?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I don’t know. I can’t get the dialect.</p>
<p><strong>61. medium shot through window</strong>: We see the pilot and
several natives in single file as they come toward the plane, buckets in
hand. In b.g., one of them lowers a bucket into a well in the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look - they’re loading up with gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>62. several shots</strong>: The gas is being loaded. Natives
on horseback dash back and forth shouting and signalling. Camels can be
glimpsed among the horses. There is tremendous disorder and
commotion.</p>
<p><strong>63. long shot</strong>: The ship leaves the ground. The
natives stand around, curiously watching.</p>
<p><strong>64. medium shot</strong>: Conway is pacing. The occupants sit
by their open windows.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting
for us! George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Where are we going? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: If you ask me, we’re heading straight for
those mountains.</p>
<p><strong>65. long shot</strong>: We see the plane against the sky. In
the b.g., there is nothing but snow-covered mountains.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: INSERT: A sign reading “Shanghai
Municipal Airport.”</p>
<p><strong>66. medium close shot</strong>: A Chinese officer is on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>chinese officer</strong>: A Douglas plane from Baskul with
Conway and four others aboard are missing. Unreported between here and
Baskul.</p>
<p><strong>67. close shot</strong>: Of a high official of the British
Foreign Office.</p>
<p><strong>high official</strong>: Make it very emphatic that His
Majesty’s Government will hold the Chinese government and all Chinese
governors of Chinese provinces responsible for the complete safety of
Robert Conway.</p>
<p><strong>high official</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>functionaries</strong>: Good morning, etc.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: No news yet, sir?</p>
<p><strong>high official</strong>: It’s fantastic. The plane couldn’t
disappear into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>robertson</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>high official</strong>: Better get a postponement of the Far
East conference. We can’t afford to meet those nations without
Conway.</p>
<p><strong>68. med. shot</strong>: The occupants are hunched up in the
corner of their seats. What little clothes they have, and what few
blankets, are bundled around them. All the windows are shut.</p>
<p><strong>insert: altometer</strong>: Registering a height of 10,000
feet.</p>
<p><strong>69. full shot</strong>: There is silence for a moment before
Barnard speaks.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: It can’t be kidnapping. They wouldn’t be
taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it.</p>
<p><strong>70. med. shot</strong>: To include George, Conway and
Lovett.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you make of it, Bob? You must have
some idea?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing
where you’re going is exciting anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed
to be a leader, your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you want him to do?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I don’t know. I’m a paleontologist, not a
Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>insert: of altometer</strong>: Registering above 10,000 feet.
We STAY on it as it climbs and climbs to 15,000 feet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mountainous country</strong>: 71. Showing the plane high
over mountain peaks.</p>
<p><strong>72. long shot</strong>: Against a moonlit sky, we see a lone
speck - the plane as it flies high above the mountains. It appears to be
traveling through endless space.</p>
<p><strong>73. med. shot</strong>: The atmosphere is pervaded with a
feeling of utter futility. The occupants are still slumped in the
corners of their seats.</p>
<p><strong>75. wider shot</strong>: Including Lovett, George, and
Conway. Lovett sits with his chin helplessly on his chest, his mouth
ludicrously open, his eyes popping. George, his teeth clenched,
struggles against a desire to sob. Conway looks at him feelingly.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh George, come on.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s not knowing that’s so awful, Bob. Not
knowing where you’re going, or why, or what’s waiting when you get
there.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: We got above that storm.</p>
<p><strong>insert: of altometer</strong>: At 20,000 feet - and while we
stay on it - keeps mounting.</p>
<p><strong>77. full shot</strong>: Deathly silence. Gloria has her hands
to her ears, rocking in pain. Suddenly her voice rents the air.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Oh! Oh! I can’t stand it any longer!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Take us down! I can’t stand this pain any
longer! Let me out of here I say! I can’t stand it any longer!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Take it easy, sister.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s oxygen! Now take it with your teeth.
That’s right - bite.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Let me alone.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Now, now. Come on now. That’s right. Now,
bite.</p>
<p><strong>78. long shot</strong>: Of the plane at twilight, fading into
deepest night.</p>
<p><strong>79. full shot</strong>: Of the cabin at night, everyone
frozen in despair. All of a sudden there is a loud, sputtering noise
from the outside. They all react - listen for a moment - until the noise
dies completely. Now nothing is heard - not even the motor.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: What’s that! What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: He must have run out of fuel.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Look! Look down there!</p>
<p><strong>80. long shot</strong>: The plane gradually tilting
downward.</p>
<p><strong>81. full shot</strong>: The ship sways several seconds and
finally rights itself.</p>
<p><strong>82. long shot</strong>: Of what they see from plane. Vast
snow-covered mountain peaks, with no sign of a stretch big enough to
land.</p>
<p><strong>83. long shot</strong>: The plane sways perilously in the
cross wind.</p>
<p><strong>84. medium shot</strong>: They are all silent - waiting
prayerfully. Conway turns to the others - his voice electric with
authority.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George - everybody - better get back towards
the tail! He may nose her over. Into the corner, quick! George -
cushions, blankets!</p>
<p><strong>85. long shot</strong>: We see the plane nearing the ground,
sailing over some smaller hills.</p>
<p><strong>86. med. close shot</strong>: With Conway in front of them,
the others are crouching in the corner. There are ad-libs of fearful
assurances while they hand around cushions and blankets.</p>
<p><strong>87. long shot</strong>: Just as the ship hits the ground for
the first time.</p>
<p><strong>88. med. close shot</strong>: The occupants brace themselves
for the jolt. The ship hits and bounces several times and finally stops.
Its nose seems to bury itself in the ground. The people are lifted high
into the air where they remain, suspended for a few seconds,
terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by grinding, crackling sounds, the
ship flops back and falls on its side. For a moment there is stark
silence - while the people do not stir. A look of relief spreads over
their faces.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Everybody all right?</p>
<p><strong>89. medium shot</strong>: George and Conway fight their way
down from the plane in the blinding snow. George quickly runs around to
the other side. Conway crosses to the cockpit, and clambers aboard.</p>
<p><strong>90. close shot in the cockpit</strong>: Lit only by the
dashboard light. Conway sticks his head in from the outside. His eyes
which have been flashing with determination suddenly sober. CAMERA PANS
OVER to pilot, who is slumped over, his chin resting on his chest.</p>
<p><strong>91. medium close shot</strong>: George pops into view on the
opposite side, just as Conway has found the pilot’s gun beside him on
the seat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is it? Has he fainted?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It looks like it. Smell those fumes?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Here George, take the gun. Hold the lights.
I’m going to search him before he comes to. We might find something
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It must have happened the moment he hit the
ground. Let’s take a look at this map.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: See that spot?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That’s where we were this morning. He had it
marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here’s where civilization ends. We
must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s it mean?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It means we’re in unexplored country -
country nobody ever reached.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, our chances of getting out of this
are pretty slim. But it’s up to us. We can’t have three hysterical
people on our hands.</p>
<p><strong>94. medium shot</strong>: As Conway enters, he is met by a
volley of questions.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: What do you say? What’d you find out?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Everything’s all right. The pilot won’t
trouble us any more. He’s - he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: Dead? How did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Probably a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, there’s nothing we can do until the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>95. close shot</strong>: Taking in George as he enters from
cockpit. His terror-stricken eyes look dully before him. He stops in the
doorway.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: The storm will probably die down by then. My
suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night’s rest.</p>
<p><strong>96. medium shot</strong>: Over the shoulders of Gloria,
Barnard and Lovett as they face Conway, who sits down.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why don’t you tell them the truth?</p>
<p><strong>97. full shot</strong>: They all wheel around and face
George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why don’t you tell them we’re a million
miles from civilization, without a chance of getting out of here alive?
It’s slow starvation - that’s what it is. It’s a slow, horrible
death!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Well, that’s perfect! Just perfect! What a
kick I’m going to get out of this!</p>
<p><strong>98. close shot - group</strong>: Favoring Gloria. The
bitterness of a lifetime in her voice.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: A year ago a doctor gave me six months to
live. That was a year ago! I’m already six months to the good. I’m on
velvet. I haven’t got a thing to lose� But you! - you, the noble animals
of the human race, what a kick I’m going to get out of watching you
squirm for a change. What a kick!</p>
<p><strong>100. full shot</strong>: Shooting from front of plane, taking
in entire cabin. The only sound that comes in on the tragic quiet is the
low moaning of the wind outside. A feeling of doom has descended upon
the five people.</p>
<p><strong>101. long shot</strong>: Shooting toward the mountains which
seem to imprison the valley below. The snowstorm, treacherous in its
fury, seems to threaten the valley with complete obliteration.</p>
<p><strong>102. medium shot</strong>: Of the plane, tilted over on its
side. It is fully covered with snow. CAMERA PANS UP TO LOVETT AND
BARNARD, shivering in their blankets as they pace worriedly.</p>
<p><strong>103. medium shot</strong>: George and Conway are missing.
Lovett turns from the window.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: They’ve been gone for three hours.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Left us here to rot. That’s what they’ve
done. Heroes of the newspapers!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: All right, all right. Keep quiet.</p>
<p><strong>plane</strong>: George and Conway are seen walking briskly
toward the plane, their few clothes a scant protection against the
biting wind.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Here they come!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, we found some food.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No chance of our starving now.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mountain grass. It’s good, too. Here, have
some. I’ve read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Listen, my brother and I have worked out a
plan. If we use our heads, we should be able to keep alive for weeks,
until he gets back.</p>
<p><strong>lovett &amp; barnard</strong>: Gets back? Where’s he
going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He doesn’t know. But he’s starting out right
away in the direction of India. Sooner or later he’s bound to run into
somebody - a tribe or something.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>106. close shot - conway</strong>: Throughout the previous
scene he has been busily occupied making preparations. Out of the
baggage hold he has brought some blankets and rope and has been wrapping
his feet in them. As George speaks, he looks up and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now here’s the idea. We found a cave over by
that small hill. After we bury the pilot, we’re moving in. We can have a
fire there. I shouldn’t be surprised to see Bob back within a week.</p>
<p><strong>107. med. close shot - group</strong>: Barnard and Lovett all
attention as George speaks. Gloria, off to one side, has her eyes peeled
on Conway intently.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: You haven’t got a Chinaman’s chance of
getting out of this country alive, and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Cave, eh? Where?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Over by that hill.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Hey - look!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>109. full shot</strong>: They all look up and glance out.</p>
<p><strong>110. long shot through window</strong>: From their angle. In
the distance, just appearing over the top of a hill, we see a caravan of
natives approaching. They are not close enough to distinguish who or
what they are, but that they are human beings is apparent.</p>
<p><strong>111. medium shot</strong>: Conway takes in the unbelievable
sight. We hear the exultant exclamations of the others. Barnard and
Lovett start out of the plane.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Where are they? Do you see them?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Do you think they’re cannibals?</p>
<p><strong>112. medium shot</strong>: Where George, Lovett and Barnard
wait, a trifle awe-stricken. Conway joins them. Gloria has stayed
inside.</p>
<p><strong>113. med. long shot</strong>: The approach of the caravan
from the viewpoint of the group. It comprises some twenty Tibetans,
attired in sheepskins, fur, hats and boots. Somewhere in the middle of
the single file is Chang, an elderly Chinese. Chang steps forward as
their leader.</p>
<p><strong>114. med. shot</strong>: As Conway leaves his group and meets
the oncoming party. He approaches Chang and bowing courteously, greets
him in Chinese. Chang turns his head slowly and speaks in perfect
Oxfordian English.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I am from a nearby Lamasery. My name is
Chang.</p>
<p><strong>115. medium shot</strong>: George, Barnard and Lovett.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why, he’s speaking English.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: English!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: And mine’s Conway.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You’ve no idea, sir, how unexpected and very
welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left
Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves
travelling in the opposite direction�</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: At the mercy of a mad pilot.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: We’d be eternally grateful if you�</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Where is your mad pilot?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps
the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We were just going to bury him when you came
along.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Pardon me�</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: So, if you will be good enough to direct us
to your Lamasery�</p>
<p><strong>116. med. close shot - group</strong>: Favoring Chang.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I shall consider it an honor to accompany you
and your friends.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You will need suitable clothes for the
journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>117. long shot</strong>: As the caravan starts its journey
back up the hill. All five people are now attired in their newly
acquired outfit.</p>
<p><strong>118. series of shots</strong>: Showing the party on various
stages of what looks like a humanly impossible journey. We see them
first climbing - then across long vastnesses of flat land. Each
succeeding time we see them, their feet drag more wearily. Their
breathing becomes more difficult. These pictures finally</p>
<p><strong>119. med. long shot</strong>: Halfway up a mountainside. The
procession is just starting around a hairpin curve. They are forced to
travel on a narrow ledge overlooking a deep ravine.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: As they cling against the rocky sides and
glance apprehensively down into the abyss below.</p>
<p><strong>121. close shot - gloria</strong>: Close by to Barnard.
Gloria’s face is wan and haggard. Every upward move seems to require a
Herculean effort. She stops and has a fit of coughing.</p>
<p><strong>122. long shot</strong>: Of the snake-like moving party. They
have reached quite a height although the peak of the mountain they are
ascending towers high above them. The cutting wind moans treacherously
as it caroms off the mountainside. A heavy mist envelops them.</p>
<p><strong>123. series of shots</strong>: As the snake-like line
approaches a narrow, treacherous footbridge and makes a slow, difficult
crossing in heavy weather.</p>
<p><strong>124. med. shot</strong>: Of the group. They round a curve and
come upon a narrow crevice which opens up into a passageway. One by one
they step through, assisted by the natives. On the other side, they sigh
relievedly. Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill has lessened. They
look up to inspect their surroundings and a startled look comes into
their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>124. med. close shot</strong>: Of Conway as he glances
casually around. What he sees leaves him transfixed. He stares
unbelievingly before him for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>125. long shot</strong>: From angle at mountain top.</p>
<p><strong>126. med. close shot</strong>: As Chang approaches
Conway.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Welcome to Shangri-La.</p>
<p><strong>127. med. shot - group</strong>: Conway’s group and Chang.
Chang smiles as he watches their astonished faces. Conway turns from the
rare magnificence of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind and storm they
had just encountered, and looks backward, in the direction from which
they came to assure himself he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang,
watching him, answers him before he can express his astonishment.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You see, we are sheltered by mountains on
every side. A strange phenomena for which we are very grateful.</p>
<p><strong>128. series of shots</strong>: As the group approaches the
beautiful and peaceful Shangri-La.</p>
<p><strong>129. med. shot</strong>: At the foot of a wide marble
stairway as the caravan stops.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It’s magic!</p>
<p><strong>130. closer shot</strong>: On the group, as they look around
and feast their eyes on the grandeur of the place.</p>
<p><strong>131. close shot - conway</strong>: Glancing around at his
picturesque surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>132. panning shot</strong>: Following Conway’s gaze. In an
upper window of a tower, their faces glued to the pane, are two robed
Lamas who stare down curiously. CAMERA PANS OVER to a very narrow
terrace covered almost completely by a floral arbor. In it stands a
statuesque woman of rare beauty. She looks down at Conway intently.</p>
<p><strong>133. close shot - conway</strong>: As he returns her gaze,
impressed by her beauty.</p>
<p><strong>george’s voice</strong>: Come along, Bob. Coming, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>134. close shot - conway</strong>: His eyes still on the girl
above. He starts up the steps, staring at her, then stumbles.</p>
<p><strong>135. close shot - the girl</strong>: Laughing at his
embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>136. close shot - conway</strong>: He smiles up at her.</p>
<p><strong>137. full shot</strong>: It suggests nothing we might expect
to see in this forsaken place. The motif is neither Oriental nor
religious - but rather a delicately appointed room, subdued in tones. At
the moment, no one is present except servants who silently set the
table.</p>
<p><strong>138. med. trucking shot</strong>: Of Lovett peering worriedly
toward dining room door. He sees two servants who flank the entrance and
steps back hesitantly. Barnard emerges from a room across the hall, and
Lovett beckons to him. Both are attired in flowing robes not unlike the
one worn by Chang.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I
definitely do not like this place.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Will you stop squawking!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Look at me. Look at what they gave me to
wear.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: You never looked better in your life. As
soon as our clothes are cleaned, they’re going to give them back to us,
Lovey.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Something tells me this means food. Come
on!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I just feel as though I’m being made ready
for the executioner.</p>
<p><strong>139. medium shot</strong>: As the servants show Lovett and
Barnard to their places.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to
it.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: That’s what they do with cattle just before
the slaughter. Fatten them.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Uh-huh. You’re a scream, Lovey.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Please don’t call me Lovey.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That was refreshing! Oh, ho - the food looks
good!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Some layout they got here. Did you get a
load of the rooms? You couldn’t do better at the Ritz.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: All the conveniences for the condemned, if
you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Don’t mind Lovey. He’s got the misery.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Mr. Conway, I don’t like this place. I don’t
like it. It’s too mysterious.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s better than freezing to death down
below, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>140. full shot</strong>: It is in semi-darkness. The moon
sends a stream of light through the windows. Outside we see the outline
of towering mountains. Spread across the bed - her clothes unchanged -
is the body of Gloria - her face sunk deep in the pillows.</p>
<p><strong>141. med. close shot</strong>: Gloria emits wracking coughs.
After a few moments - she sits up. Her cheeks are wet - her hair
disheveled - her eyes bloodshot. We get an impression of someone who has
suffered for hours. Finally, her coughing begins again - and unable to
stand it, she rises and paces the floor - then she crosses to the window
and looks down, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER - and into her eyes has come a
grim, determined expression.</p>
<p><strong>142. long shot</strong>: From Gloria’s point of view.</p>
<p><strong>continuation scene 141</strong>: Gloria continues to peer
below - and her coughing resumes.</p>
<p><strong>143. medium shot</strong>: As Chang comes down the corridor -
hears the coughing and stops.</p>
<p><strong>144. full shot</strong>: Chang enters and watches Gloria for
a moment before speaking.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Is there something I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I’ve offered you some warm broth. I thought
perhaps-</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: You get out of here! If any of you men think
you can come busting in here-</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Please calm yourself. You’ll soon be well if
you do.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: I don’t need any advice from you! Get me a
doctor!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I’m sorry, but we have no doctors here.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: No doctors? That’s fine. That’s just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Please let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump
over that cliff! I’ve been looking and looking at the bottom of that
mountain, but I haven’t got the nerve to jump!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You shouldn’t be looking at the bottom of the
mountain. Why don’t you try looking up at the top sometimes?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Don’t preach that cheap, second-hand stuff
to me! Go on, beat it. Beat it!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Peace be with you, my child.</p>
<p><strong>145. full shot</strong>: They all look up as Chang enters. He
is escorted to his place at the head of the table by two servants who
stand on either side of his chair.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Good evening. Good evening, my friends. Oh
no, no, no, please sit down. I hope you found everything
satisfactory.</p>
<p><strong>barnard &amp; conway</strong>: Swell. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You shouldn’t have waited for me.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Where’s the girl? Miss Stone.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: She’s remaining in her room. She isn’t
feeling very well. Now please go on without me. I eat very little.</p>
<p><strong>146. medium shot</strong>: Shooting down the long table
toward Chang. He sits up straight - studying them - as the others bend
over their food.</p>
<p><strong>147. medium shot</strong>: The meal is over. Conway sips from
a wine glass.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Well, there’s certainly nothing wrong with
that meal!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: And the wine - excellent.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I’m glad you like it. It’s made right here in
the valley.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Now that dinner is over, if you’ll excuse
us, we’re very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back
home.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The first thing we want to do is to cable
the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother.
There’s a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Really? Well, as regards cabling, I’m afraid
I can’t help. Unfortunately, we have no wireless here. As a matter of
fact, we have no means of communication with the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Not even a radio?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: It’s always been a source of deep regret, but
the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In that event, we better make arrangements
to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to
civilization.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Are you so certain you are away from it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: As far away as I ever want to be.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Of course, the porters will be very well
paid - that is, within reason.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I’m afraid that wouldn’t help. You see, we
have no porters here.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: No porters here!!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: What about those men we met this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Yes. Those are our own people. They never
venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too
hazardous.</p>
<p><strong>148. close shot - conway</strong>: To intercut with above
speech.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: What has been occupying Conway’s interest.
It is a picture of Chang which he has been listlessly drawing.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: How do you account for all this? Who
brought it in?</p>
<p><strong>149. full shot</strong>: They all turn to Chang
expectantly.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some
five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside
world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course,
they make the journey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How can we get in touch with them?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: In that respect, you are exceedingly
fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time
now�</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: What exactly do you mean by “almost any time
now”?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Well, we’ve been expecting this particular
shipment for the past two years.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Two years!?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: But I can assure you, gentlemen, if there is
a prolonged delay, Shangri-La will endeavor to make your stay as
pleasant as possible. And now if you will excuse me, it is getting late.
I do hope you all sleep well. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Good night, Mr. Conway.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Good night, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: That’s what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway,
I don’t like that man. He’s too vague.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We didn’t get much information out of him,
did we Bob?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It seems to me we should be grateful. We
were in a bad mess this morning.</p>
<p><strong>150. medium shot</strong>: As Conway crosses to a balcony
door.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: That’s what I say. What do you say to a
rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Not for me, thanks. No, I’m too weary.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: How about you Lovey? Come on. Let’s you and
I play a game of honeymoon bridge.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Thinking? What about some double
solitaire?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: As a matter of fact, I’m very good at double
solitaire.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Then I’m your man. Come on, Toots.</p>
<p><strong>151. medium shot</strong>: Conway is listening moodily to the
soulful music. George wanders in beside him.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hello, George. Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: We’ve had plenty of it the last few
days.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s far from over, from what I can see.
This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with
civilization. Bob, you don’t seem concerned at all.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, I’m feeling far too peaceful to be
concerned about anything. I think I’m going to like it here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You talk as though you intend on
staying.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Something happened to me, when we arrived
here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place,
and feel certain that you’ve been there before?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford
calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of
the hill.</p>
<p><strong>152. two shot - conway and george</strong>: Conway’s point of
view, studying George.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Don’t you ever want to see what’s on the
other side of the hill?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What could there be except just another
hill? In any event, I’m not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we
should be concerned about getting home. I’d give anything to be in
London right now.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Of course you would. If ever we get out of
this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen’s
father.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean if we should get out?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Did I say “if”?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s what you said.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well - I mean�</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s on your mind, Bob? You talk as though
we’re going to have trouble getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, I’ve been putting things together.
Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And
why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at
the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that
point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Chang’s first question was about the
pilot.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There must be some connection between the
plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why,
Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That’s what’s on the other side of the
hill.</p>
<p><strong>154. long shot from a tower room</strong>: Shooting over
shoulders of two men in f.g.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: It’s three thousand feet, practically
straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon,
as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides
those here in Shangri-La.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Who and what is Shangri-La? You?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Goodness, no!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: So there are others?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Who, for instance?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: In time you will meet them all.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: He watches Chang’s face searchingly, then
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: For a man who talks a great deal, it’s
amazing how unenlightening you can be.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: There are some things, my dear Conway, I
deeply regret I may not discuss.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You know, that’s the fourth time you’ve said
that today. You should have a record made of it.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Shall we go inside? I should so like to show
you some of our rare treasures.</p>
<p><strong>156. follow shot with george</strong>: On a spiral staircase.
Looking surreptitiously around, he backs his way up. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM
as he reaches the top of the landing. Here he stops and glances around
the corner down a corridor.</p>
<p><strong>157. medium shot</strong>: CAMERA FOLLOWS GEORGE as he peers
into several rooms searchingly. He finally arrives at one and
enters.</p>
<p><strong>158. full shot</strong>: George enters and looks around. It
is dimly lit and apparently unoccupied. He crosses to a desk and picks
up several objects, scrutinizing them closely.</p>
<p><strong>in alcove</strong>: She sits, a tapestry board on her lap,
watching George with keen interest.</p>
<p><strong>160. close shot - george</strong>: He opens a book and
glances at its contents.</p>
<p><strong>161. med. shot to include both</strong>: Maria surveys his
back appraisingly.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Excuse me�</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Please don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Tea will be served any moment.</p>
<p><strong>162. close shot - george</strong>: He watches her with grave
speculation for a long moment, then slowly moves toward her.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Won’t you come in?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: My name is Maria. Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>163. full shot</strong>: It is a huge room. The walls are
lined with impressive tomes. Chang is showing Conway around.</p>
<p><strong>164. medium shot</strong>: Conway has just finished browsing
through one of the books.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: By the way, what religion do you follow
here?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: We follow many.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: To put it simply, I should say that our
general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding
excesses of every kind, even including� �the excess of virtue
itself.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That’s intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: We find, in the Valley, it makes for better
happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in
return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people
are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than
moderately happy.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: How about law and order? You have no
soldiers or police?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Oh, good heavens, no!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: How do you deal with incorrigibles?
Criminals?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Why, we have no crime here. What makes a
criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess
something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a
sufficiency of everything.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You have no disputes over women?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Only very rarely. You see, it would not be
considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he
didn’t give a hang if it was good manners or not?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Well, in that event, it would be good manners
on the part of the other man to let him have her.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That’s very convenient. I think I’d like
that.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You’d be surprised, my dear Conway, how a
little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated
problems.</p>
<p><strong>167. med. close shot - the two</strong>: Chang smiles. Conway
scarcely hears the last speech, for his attention has been caught by the
playing of a piano. He stops to listen. Chang has walked out of
scene.</p>
<p><strong>168. medium shot</strong>: Conway locates the direction
whence the music comes, goes to a doorway where he stops.</p>
<p><strong>169. close shot - chang</strong>: He realizes Conway did not
follow him and turns. When he sees Conway, his face clouds - and he
starts toward him.</p>
<p><strong>170. close shot at door</strong>: Conway watches someone
through door with grave interest. Chang enters scene and follows his
gaze.</p>
<p><strong>171. full shot</strong>: From doorway. It is a spacious,
high-ceilinged room, oddly shaped, and except for a piano, a harp and
several chairs, is otherwise sparsely furnished. At the extreme end, the
room is set off by an alcove of stained glass extending from the ceiling
to the floor, where it finishes with a deep window seat. At the piano we
see an old man - and by his side is the girl Conway saw last night. They
finish playing and both laugh heartily.</p>
<p><strong>172. close shot at doorway</strong>: Conway finds her
laughter infectious - and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>174. close shot at doorway</strong>: Chang quickly takes
Conway by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: At some time in the future you will have the
pleasure of meeting her.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Some man had better get ready to be very
courteous to me.</p>
<p><strong>175. closeup - the girl</strong>: She continues to stare off
toward the door, her eyes alight with a keen interest.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: But Mr. Chang, all these things - books,
instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in
over those mountains by porters?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: They were.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, it must have taken�</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Centuries.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Centuries! Where did you get the money to
pay for all those treasures?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Of course we have no money as you know it. We
do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because
there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.</p>
<p><strong>177. close shot - the two</strong>: They have arrived in a
small room, where they pause. Chang reaches into a bowl of large nuts,
cracks one, and hands the nut to Conway. Then he does the same for
himself. During the following scene, both are eating nuts from the
bowl.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That would suit me perfectly. I’m always
broke. How did you pay for them?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Our Valley is very rich in a metal called
gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside
world. So we merely . . .</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: �buy and sell?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange
.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang,
there’s something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect
there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was
it? How did it all start?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: That, my dear Conway, is the story of a
remarkable man.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: A Belgian priest by the name of Father
Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man
indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built
Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In
fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: When was all this?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it
was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to
death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of
course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: He amputated his own leg?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned
to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved
his leg. It would have healed without amputation.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, they didn’t actually mean that.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it
too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They’ve
never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought
would naturally be true for anyone else living here.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, is it?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Rather astonishingly so, yes. And
particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when
he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years
old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: 108 and still active?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You’re startled?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Forgive me. I should have told you it is
quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet,
mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence
of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand,
how often do you hear the expression, “He worried himself to death?” or,
“This thing or that killed him?”</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Very often.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a
rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That’s all very fine if it works out. A
little amazing, of course.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I surprise you? Now that’s news.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I mean, your amazement. I could have
understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and
written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize
one of your own dreams when you see it?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Mr. Chang, if you don’t mind, I think I’ll
go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Then everything is quite all right, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>178. med. close shot</strong>: On a garden bench Gloria
slumps languidly. Suddenly we hear Barnard’s voice, yelling. Gloria
quickly turns her back. Barnard runs into scene.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Honey, it’s terrific! Terrific! I just saw
something that will make your hair stand on end. You see those hills
over there? Gold! Gold! Popping right out of them! Tons of it! Now look,
you keep this under your hat, because if those other monkeys hear about
it, they’ll declare themselves in. But if I can mine that stuff, I’ll
throw a bombshell into Wall Street. Now look, I’ve got a plan - and if
I�</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Aw say, honey, you aren’t feeling well, are
you? Look, don’t pay too much attention to what those doctors tell you.
I’ve seen an awful lot of people fool them, and I’ve got a hunch that
this place is going to be good for you. Honest, I have.</p>
<p><strong>179. close shot</strong>: Lovett enters warily, sits down at
his desk and begins to write in his journal.</p>
<p><strong>the diary of alexander p. lovett</strong>: 2nd Day at
Shangri-La</p>
<p><strong>180. full shot</strong>: It is a bright, cheery morning.
Conway is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings. He comes into the
area where the horses are stabled. Two men are busily grooming the
horses.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Conway!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, you speak English, do you?</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>one of the men</strong>: Would you like to take a ride,
Mr. Conway?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: No, thanks. Not just now.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, I think I will take that ride!</p>
<p><strong>181. med. shot - conway</strong>: As he rides off in pursuit
of her.</p>
<p><strong>182. several shots of the chase</strong>: Showing Sondra
successfully eluding him - as he closes in on her.</p>
<p><strong>184. another angle</strong>: Showing Sondra disappearing
behind a mountain waterfall. Conway dashes up, but she is lost from
sight. He wheels around several times - and unable to find her, looks
puzzled. Finally, giving up, he starts slowly back. After a few moments
he is startled by her laughter, and glances around.</p>
<p><strong>185. long shot</strong>: From his view - shooting upward.
High up - near the summit of the hill - we see Sondra - waving and
laughing. Then she swings her horse around and disappears.</p>
<p><strong>186. closeup - conway</strong>: As he smiles - amused and
interested.</p>
<p><strong>187. long shot - sondra</strong>: As she swims in a mountain
stream, apparently in the buff. From a distance, we see her climb onto a
rock to dry off.</p>
<p><strong>188. closeup - sondra</strong>: As she shakes her shimmering
hair.</p>
<p><strong>189. medium shot - conway</strong>: He has caught up to her
tethered horse and is skulking around trying to find out where she
is.</p>
<p><strong>190. close shot - a squirrel</strong>: A squirrel, near to
Sondra, chatters excitedly.</p>
<p><strong>191. close shot - sondra</strong>: She can apparently
understand the squirrel’s warning. She hurries to dive back into the
water and swim to the other side. She comes up, spots Conway and watches
him from hiding, behind some bushes.</p>
<p><strong>192. medium shot - conway</strong>: Conway has discovered her
clothing and is constructing a kind of scarecrow on a bush out of them.
As a crowning touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, his eyes twinkling
at his little joke. With one final glance over his shoulder, he turns to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>193. close shot - sondra</strong>: She stifles her laughter
as he vanishes from view.</p>
<p><strong>194. full shot</strong>: Lovett and Barnard are at the table
waiting for the others. Several servants are in the b.g. George paces
nervously in front of the door.</p>
<p><strong>195. med. shot at table</strong>: Lovett and Barnard. Barnard
nibbles at something.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Bah! Fossils! Why? What for? Running around
digging up a lot of old bones! You didn’t dig yourself out of one of
those holes by any chance, did you?</p>
<p><strong>196. medium shot</strong>: Conway is coming down the
corridor. George comes out of door to dining room and starts forward.
Conway walks along in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, a Cockney
song.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You seem gay. Did you find out anything?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well - I heard that if you want a man’s
wife, she’s yours, if he’s got any manners.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nothing about the porters yet?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Porters?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good heavens, Bob, we’ve been here two weeks
and we haven’t found out a thing.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, we haven’t been murdered in our beds
yet, George, have we?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m afraid the porters are just a myth.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>198. medium shot</strong>: As Conway and George enter,
Barnard calls to them:</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I’m
starved!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Well, I’m certainly glad to see that it’s
all finally organized. Okay, handsome. Dish it out, and make it
snappy.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Hey, what’s happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Nothing. Why?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Why, you look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That’s unkind. Doesn’t Miss Stone always
look beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>199. med. close shot at table</strong>: Featuring Gloria,
Barnard and Conway.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I got it! It’s your make-up. You’ve got
none on.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: And say, honey, you look a million per cent
better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and
don’t you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it’s like hiding
behind a mask.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a
mask? What do you mean? You’ve been wearing a mask ever since we met
you.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Have I?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: It’s very strange, you know. You’ve never
told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don’t you take
your mask off for once!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: All right, I will! I’ll let my hair down!
Why not? It can’t make any real difference now. Hey Lovey, were you ever
chased by the police?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Believe me, it’s no fun. When you fellas
picked me up at Baskul, they’d been on my tail for a year.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: The police?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Uh-huh. Did you ever hear of Chalmers
Bryant?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Bryant’s Utilities - that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I knew it. I knew I had a reason for hating
you! Sir, you’re a thief.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: He never stole anything from you , did
he?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities that I
bought with money that I saved for 20 years teaching school, and now I
couldn’t sell it for postage stamps.</p>
<p><strong>201. med. shot - group</strong>: Featuring Barnard.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: That’s too bad. I got a half million
shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: A colossal nerve you have sitting there and
talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of
people�</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: You know, that’s what makes the whole thing
so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary,
everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind
you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people,
becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight
he’s the biggest crook the country ever had.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I,
for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we
get back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean - “when we get back”?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What makes you think we’re ever going to get
back? You may not know it, but you’re all prisoners here. We were
deliberately kidnapped and brought here - and nobody knows why�</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I’m not content to be a prisoner. I’m
going to find out when we’re going to get out of this place. I’ll make
that Chinese talk if it’s the last thing I do!</p>
<p><strong>202. medium shot</strong>: Before anybody can realize what
his intentions are, he has bolted out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George!</p>
<p><strong>203. medium shot</strong>: As George strides determinedly out
into the hall, yelling.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Chang! Chang!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where is he? Where’s Chang? Where is he?
Where’s Chang, or I’ll blow your brains out!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, what do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Let me go, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, come back!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Chang! Chang! Chang!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come here, you! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>204. close shot</strong>: As the others trail in.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Had to sock him, eh?</p>
<p><strong>205. med. close shot</strong>: Conway brings George in,
followed by the others. He drapes him across his bed. Conway stands by
his side, looking down at him, deeply concerned. After a moment, Conway
shakes him and George awakens with a start.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Let me up! Let me up!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All right. Sorry, George.</p>
<p><strong>206. med. shot toward door</strong>: On Barnard, Lovett and
Gloria. Barnard wanders over to Conway, who appears lost in thought.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Say Conway, is it true about us being
kidnapped?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I say, is it true about us being
kidnapped?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Mr. Chang!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Do you mind stepping in here for a
moment?</p>
<p><strong>207. full shot</strong>: As Chang enters. He bows courteously
to the others, who stand in front of George’s bed. Conway shuts the door
and turns the key. He crosses to a door leading to another room - and
locks this one, also. Chang watches him curiously. The others, including
George, who is now alert, are puzzled and somewhat impressed. Then
Conway comes to Chang.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Mr. Chang, you have been very kind to us -
and we appreciate it. But for some reason we are being held prisoners
here, and we want to know why.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: As Conway’s voice continues, talking to
Chang:</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Personally, I don’t mind at all. I’m
enjoying every minute of it. But my brother is not of the same opinion,
nor are the others. It’s time we were told what it’s all about.</p>
<p><strong>209. med. shot - group</strong>: Conway still continuing:</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: We want to know why we were kidnapped, why
we are being kept here, but most important of all - do we get the
porters, and when? Until we get this information, my dear Mr. Chang, I
am very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You know, it’s very, very strange, but when
you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the
most amazing news. The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Yeah. I though you ran this joint.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we
get the porters?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: The High Lama is the only one from whom any
information can come.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t believe him, Bob. He’s just trying to
get out.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Sounds like a stall to me.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: One moment. You say the High Lama is the
only one who can give us any information?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: The only one.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: And he can arrange for the porters to take
us back?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: The High Lama arranges everything,
Mr. Conway.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, then he’s the man I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Better wait here until I get back. We’ll
soon know where we stand.</p>
<p><strong>210. med. trucking shot</strong>: With Conway and Chang.
Chang walks in a high state of expectancy. Conway is grim. They climb a
narrow spiral staircase.</p>
<p><strong>211. med. close shot</strong>: They proceed up the stairs
until they arrive at a large, impressively ornate double door which
seems to open automatically the moment they approach. Chang remains
without. The moment Conway steps over the threshold, the doors swing
closed.</p>
<p><strong>212. med. shot</strong>: As the doors swing shut. Conway
turns and realizes Chang is no longer with him.</p>
<p><strong>213. close shot at door</strong>: Conway stands still,
glancing around the room, which is lit so dimly that nothing definite is
distinguishable.</p>
<p><strong>214. full shot</strong>: To show what Conway sees. For the
moment, practically nothing. As his eyes become adjusted to the
darkness, he begins to sense the architecture and furnishings of the
room. But as yet no sign of life. SLOW PAN SHOT reveals it to be a
dark-curtained and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather simply. Very
sombre, indistinct tapestries drape the back walls. While the CAMERA</p>
<p><strong>follows conway’s gaze, moving slowly</strong>: AROUND, a
voice is heard.</p>
<p><strong>high lama’s voice</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Conway.</p>
<p><strong>215. close shot - conway</strong>: He stares, motionless, at
the eerie vision.</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: Please come in.</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: Sit here, near me. I am an old man and
can do no one any harm.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Are you the High Lama?</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>217. close shot - the two</strong>: As Conway,
expressionless, sits down opposite the High Lama.</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: I trust you have been comfortable at
Shangri-La, since your arrival.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Personally, I’ve enjoyed your community very
much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined
to leave as soon as�</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s astonishing - and incredible, but�</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: What is it, my son?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You’re the man Chang told me about! You’re
the first - who - two hundred years ago� �you’re still alive, Father
Perrault!</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: Sit down, my son. You may not know it,
but I’ve been an admirer of yours for a great many years.</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder and
public hero. I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books, said,
“There are moments in every man’s life when he glimpses the
eternal.”</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: That Conway seemed to belong here. In
fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: That I be brought here? Who had that
brilliant idea?</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: Sondra Bizet.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, the girl at the piano?</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: Yes. She has read your books and has a
profound admiration for you, as have we all.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Of course I have suspected that our being
here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we’re never
supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn’t concern me greatly.
I’ll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present
is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already
thriving community?</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: We need men like you here, to be sure
that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which,
Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world’s
standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you
can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity.
Here, however, in Shangri-La, by our standards your life has just begun,
and may go on and on.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future
doesn’t excite me. It would have to have a point. I’ve sometimes doubted
whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be
even more pointless. No, I’d need a much more definite reason for going
on and on.</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: We have reason. It is the entire meaning
and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I
saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar
passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply
until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time
when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over
the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to
destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to
gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and
preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is
rushing.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I understand you, Father.</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: You must come again, my son. Good
night.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: Conway comes through. He walks as if in a
trance. CAMERA PULLS BACK as he continues on his way - bearing an
expression of deep absorption.</p>
<p><strong>221. med. shot</strong>: As Conway walks toward an open door
at the end of corridor leading to the garden. Lovett emerges from one of
the rooms and sees him. He beckons to those inside and almost
immediately they come out and start toward Conway.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: We thought you were never coming back!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What about the porters?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Porters?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Didn’t you find out anything about the
porters?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Why - I’m sorry - but I�</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: What were you doing all this time?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: For heaven’s sake, Bob, what’s the matter
with you? You went out there for the purpose of�</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George. George - do you mind? I’m sorry, but
I can’t talk about it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>223. med. close shot</strong>: Shooting toward garden through
open doorway. Conway walks away from the crowd in f.g., all staring at
him, nonplussed. We see Conway walk through the garden in b.g. and
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>224. closeup - george in doorway</strong>: He stares at his
brother, off, fearfully.</p>
<p><strong>225. full shot</strong>: Of a pleasant and peaceful place.
Conway is walking along moodily, drinking in the pastoral beauty.</p>
<p><strong>227. full shot</strong>: Conway is walking along a street in
the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare, unlike anything we have ever
seen before. The small, one-story huts along its very narrow sidewalk
are of singularly varied architecture - giving the impression of being
“homemade.” As a result of this, no two are alike. Only one
characteristic about them is similar - their cleanliness. Something
about the atmosphere is fresh and wholesome and peaceful. In front of
several of the huts native women sit - some weaving on a tapestry board,
some nursing babies, some asleep, and some just sitting. The keynote is
contentment.</p>
<p><strong>228. med. trucking shot</strong>: With Conway, walking along.
As he passes, the women smile at him in the most friendly fashion. From
inside these homes, soft and soothing music emanates. At the end of the
street, Conway finally arrives at a garden spot. The suddenness of this
is startling, too - because of its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway
throws himself at the foot of an overhanging tree, and leans against the
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>229. close shot - conway</strong>: He throws his head back,
shuts his eyes - in a restful and contemplative mood. He remains this
way quietly for a few seconds, when he is attracted by the singing of a
chorus of children’s voices. He glances around.</p>
<p><strong>230. long shot</strong>: From Conway’s angle. In the shadow
of a row of overhanging trees which form an arch, a group of fifteen or
twenty children sing a hymn, or nursery song - in English. Sondra stands
in front of them, a baton in hand, conducting them.</p>
<p><strong>231. close shot - conway</strong>: He smiles at the sight -
and springing to his feet starts in their direction.</p>
<p><strong>232. med. shot</strong>: Of Sondra and the children, as
Conway saunters into the scene behind her. He finds himself a
comfortable place under a tree and sits down. The children, still
singing, have seen his approach and crane their necks curiously.</p>
<p><strong>233. close shot - sondra</strong>: She waves her baton and
sings with the children. Then she notices they are being distracted and
casually turns her head. She is somewhat startled at seeing Conway, but
quickly recovers her composure, and smiles wanly.</p>
<p><strong>234. close shot - conway</strong>: He smiles also.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>235. wider angle</strong>: To include Sondra, Conway and some
of the children. They finish the song, and Conway applauds. Sondra
curtsies prettily. She turns to the children.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: This is Mr. Conway, children.</p>
<p><strong>236. med. shot</strong>: In unison the twenty children
curtsey.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Conway.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Very well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: All right, children. We will now sing�</p>
<p><strong>237. closeup - conway</strong>: He lights a cigarette and,
leaning against a tree, studies Sondra’s face - impressed by her
beauty.</p>
<p><strong>238. closeup - sondra</strong>: She slyly glances backward,
and a self-conscious smile covers her face.</p>
<p><strong>239. med. shot</strong>: As a child from the ranks breaks and
comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen to the child - who whispers in
her ear. Sondra, murmuring, “Of course, dear” and still waving her baton
is, for the moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning to Conway, holds
out the baton to him.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>240. close shot - conway</strong>: Conducting the chorus in
all seriousness - albeit a trifle awkwardly. He turns his head to watch
Sondra, and when he looks forward again, finds himself off-beat. To
cover his embarrassment, he smiles foolishly.</p>
<p><strong>241. med. shot</strong>: They come to the end of the song,
but Conway, whose eyes are searching for Sondra, is oblivious of this
and continues to conduct mechanically. The children break into
laughter.</p>
<p><strong>242. med. close trucking shot</strong>: With Sondra as she
returns with the child clinging to her. As she turns a bend, she looks
up, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>243. close shot - sondra</strong>: As she laughs
heartily.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All right, children. Now teacher is going to
be very busy this afternoon, so school’s dismissed!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, please. I hope you’re not going to run
away this time.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: My name’s Sondra.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I hope you’ll forgive me for�</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You know, each time I see you, I hear that
music. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Oh, you mean my pigeons.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: It’s these little flutes that I attached to
their tails. See? Come along with me, and I’ll show you how I put them
on.</p>
<p><strong>246. med. close shot</strong>: Of a large coop where pigeons
are bred and raised. The pigeons flutter around, landing on Sondra and
Conway, as she shows him her collection with pride. She grabs one pigeon
and ties one of the miniature flutes to its legs.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: You see, this is how we tie them on. And by
varying the size of the flutes, I can get any notes I wish. The wind
does the rest. Here’s a little fellow who lost his!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Was this your idea?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Yes. Hold this pigeon.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You suggested my being brought here, didn’t
you? What gave you the idea I’d fit in?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: That was easy. I read your books.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, you’ve read my books. You do more
things! What have my books got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I saw a man whose life was empty.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: A man whose life was empty!</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of
that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and
you knew it.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little
boy whistling in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you
realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke
pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take
Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are
headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing?
Does that look like a man whose life is empty?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You’re absolutely right. And I had to come
all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other
person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I really only brought you here to show you
my pigeons!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Don’t worry about the pigeons. From now on,
you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!</p>
<p><strong>247. medium trucking shot</strong>: Sondra and Conway,
walking. This spot is on top of a hill overlooking the splendor of the
valley below.</p>
<p><strong>248. closer trucking shot</strong>: They walk along silently
for a few seconds, while Conway studies her face speculatively.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: There are so many questions I’d like to ask
you, I hardly know where to begin.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I’ll help you. To begin with, you’d like to
know what I’m doing here. Whether I was born here.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Well, I was almost born here. It took place
in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a
party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When
Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to
climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father
Perrault himself.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him
last night.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Father Perrault. Of course I can’t quite get
used to this age thing.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, you’re going to make life very
simple.</p>
<p><strong>249. med. shot</strong>: As they arrive at a scenic overlook.
It is getting toward dusk.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s inconceivable.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All of it. Father Perrault and his
magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world,
with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me
entirely.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I’m sorry. I thought I was to be the light.
But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: On the contrary, you’re not strange. And
that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri-La. The
sense that I’ve been here before, that I belong here.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I’m so glad.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I can’t quite explain it, but everything is
somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its
feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head
explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry
blossoms, you - all somehow familiar. I’ve been kidnapped and brought
here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably,
with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and
close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Perhaps because you’ve always been a part of
Shangri-La without knowing it.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I wonder.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I’m sure of it. Just as I’m sure there’s a
wish for Shangri-La in everyone’s heart. I have never seen the outside
world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who
are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they
are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security,
where there’s beauty and comfort, where they wouldn’t have to be mean
and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this
valley.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Then it wouldn’t be a garden spot for
long.</p>
<p><strong>250. trucking shot</strong>: Barnard is bringing a reluctant
Lovett along on an excursion into the Valley. They pass friendly natives
and farmers at work.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I don’t know why I associate with you,
Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever
your name may be.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Just call me Barney.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing
in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Okay, Lovey.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: And this trip to the valley. I can’t imagine
why I’d allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don’t know anything
about these people. We’re not even armed!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: They’re very nice people - except that
they’ve got horns.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Horns?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Yeah. You know.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Horns? What kind of horns?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Here, here! Come on. They won’t hurt
you.</p>
<p><strong>251. medium shot</strong>: Barnard has encountered some
beautiful native girls, and they have surrounded him with their
hospitality - plying him with wine and food. Lovett is off scene.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Okay, honey, all I want is a glass of wine!
Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>native girl</strong>: Please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: This is fine. This is swell. No, just a
drink. I’ve been walking and I’m a little thirsty, you see? That’s all
right. I don’t just happen to be very hungry. Say look, all I asked for
was a glass of water. Look here, I’ve got to have some help with this.
Now, Lovey! Where is Lovey?</p>
<p><strong>252. close shot</strong>: Of Lovett, lagging behind and
missing out on all the fun.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Mr. Barnard?</p>
<p><strong>253. medium shot</strong>: Favoring Barnard as Lovett comes
into view.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a
glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: So that’s where you are. I might of known
it. No wonder you couldn’t hear me.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit
down!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: And be poisoned out here in the open?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Certainly not!</p>
<p><strong>native girl</strong>: For me, won’t you please have a glass
of wine?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I never drink wine in the daytime.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: There you are!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: This doesn’t obligate me in any way.</p>
<p><strong>native girl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>254. full shot</strong>: A merry Lovett has had too much to
drink. Now he is entertaining a group of native children, who are
huddled at his feet. Other natives watch the entertainment. Bernard,
watching from one side, is losing patience.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: �then the bears came right into the bedroom
and the little baby bear said, “Oh, somebody’s been sleeping in my bed.”
And then the mama bear said, “Oh dear, somebody’s been sleeping in my
bed!” And then the big papa bear, he roared, “And somebody’s been
sleeping in my bed!” Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were
in a quandary!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I’m going to sleep in my bed. Come on,
Lovey!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: They were in a quandary, and�</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Come on, Lovey.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Why? Why ‘come on’ all the time? What’s the
matter? Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it
up! Aren’t you having any fun? Where was I?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: In a quandary.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I’m telling this story! I’m telling it. Yes,
the poor little bears didn’t know what to do, you see, because somebody
had been sleeping in their bed.</p>
<p><strong>a child in the audience</strong>: Who slept in their
beds?</p>
<p><strong>native girl</strong>: Who was it, Lovey?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh, you call me Lovey, eh? Look at those
eyes? There’s the devil in those eyes!</p>
<p><strong>255. close shot</strong>: Following Lovett as he enters,
unusually chipper, singing “Here we go gathering nuts in May . . .” He
is in such a good mood that he improvises the lyrics, putting Shangri-La
in with his la-la-las. After glancing out the window, Lovett sits down
and pulls out his journal. He writes:</p>
<p><strong>i could sow a wild oat�</strong>: He pauses, looks up, opens
the compact box at his side and looks at himself confidently and
admiringly in the mirror. Returning to his journal, he adds:</p>
<p><strong>256. med. shot</strong>: With George as he disconsolately
walks. He is startled by the sound of Maria’s voice calling him. CAMERA
PANS with him as he crosses to a sheltered spot where Maria sits on a
garden bench.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You promised to come for tea yesterday. I
waited for so long.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m sorry. I haven’t even got any cigarettes
left!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’ll make some for you! You will come
today?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Please say you will. The days are so very
long and lonely without you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ll tell me some of the things I want to
know, won’t you? You’ll tell me who runs this place. And why we were
kidnapped. And what they’re going to do with us!</p>
<p><strong>258. closeup - maria</strong>: From the moment he starts to
speak, her face clouds. George’s voice continues without
interruption.</p>
<p><strong>george’s voice</strong>: Chang’s been lying about those
porters, hasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>259. med. close shot</strong>: Following Conway and Sondra as
they stroll peacefully hand in hand amongst the sculpted shrubbery and
rows of flowers. There is a sudden pealing of bells. The two of them
look off and pause, their gaze momentarily captured by picturesque
snowcapped peaks in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Beautiful! I’m waiting for the bump.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Bump?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes
us all up.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: You see, it’s not a dream.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You know, sometimes I think that it’s the
other that’s the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go
there?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Goodness, no. From what you tell me about
it, it certainly doesn’t sound very attractive.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s not so bad, really. Some phases are a
little sordid, of course. That’s only to be expected.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of
people struggling for existence.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Struggling, why?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Well, everybody naturally wants to make a
place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You know, if you keep on asking that, we’re
not going to get anywhere. And don’t ask me why.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I was just going to.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s the most annoying word in the English
language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Why, mother?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Because mother read it in a book somewhere,
and if mother’s little darling doesn’t take her fingers out of the salad
bowl this instant, mother’s going to wring her little neck.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Would you like to wring my little neck?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I’d love it!</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>260. close-up</strong>: They kiss.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I’ve thought about it for years. I knew
you’d come. And I knew if you did - you’d never leave. Am I forgiven for
sending for you?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Forgiven. You know, when we were on that
plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly
shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the
distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched
arms when we landed. And I’ve been thinking that somehow you’re that
plane, and I’m that silly shadow. That all my life I’ve been rushing up
and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming
that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and
into my arms.</p>
<p><strong>261. medium shot</strong>: Chang is being visited by Lovett,
who has lost his petrified manner.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing!
And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I’ve
looked around. I’ve seen everything. Your woodworkers and your
cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right
here you have Utopia.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You’ve very kind Mr. Lovett.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: I don’t mean it in that sense. I only give
credit where credit is due. Er, Mr. Chang, I’m very anxious to have you
realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping
story.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Oh, I’m so glad.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did
last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self-inventory. I
said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, “Lovey”� Mr. Lovett!
“Mr. Lovett,” I said, “you are an ungrateful fool . . .”</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Why, no.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: “Ungrateful fool . . . !” Those were my very
words to myself last night. “Here are these people in Shangri-La doing
everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I
haven’t done one single thing to show my appreciation.”</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Now, what would you like to do?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your
permission of course, and while I’m waiting for these porters, I would
like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them
something practical and something useful. Geology.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Splendid!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Isn’t it? Isn’t it! You know I was a
professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I’m sure you were. When would you like to
start?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh, immediately.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Then it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh, thank you. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>263. medium shot</strong>: Conway sits on a bench - Barnard
leans over him, showing him a map - a-twitter with an idea.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: You see? You get the idea? From this
reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I’m going to get a
great kick out of this. Of course it’s just to keep my hand in, but with
the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole
village down there. Can rig it up in no time. Do you realize those poor
people are still going to the well for water?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Think of it! In times like these.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Say, what about that gold deal?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Gold. You were going to�</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody’s going to
run off with it. Say, I’ve got to get busy. I want to show this whole
layout to Chang. So long. Don’t you take any wooden nickels.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>265. closeup - conway</strong>: As he watches Barnard go,
pleased at the metamorphosis that’s taking place in him. Suddenly he
sees George and jumps up.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George.</p>
<p><strong>266. med. long shot</strong>: From Conway’s angle. George has
just made his appearance.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George!</p>
<p><strong>267. med. close shot</strong>: As Conway catches up to
George�and takes him by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George - you’re behaving like a child. You
haven’t opened your mouth in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t see that there’s anything to
say.</p>
<p><strong>268. closeup - conway</strong>: As a look of deep pain comes
into his face. He stands for several seconds - looking helplessly - and
despairingly in George’s direction.</p>
<p><strong>269. medium shot</strong>: Chang and Conway playing chess.
Conway leans over the board, a faraway expression on his face. Chang
leans over - moves a ‘man’ into position.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I’m afraid that does it.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Yes. I’m afraid it does.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Shall we have another?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: No thanks. Not tonight if you don’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Come in, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>270. close shot - maria</strong>: In doorway. She seems
slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Charming, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Yes, charming.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Your brother seems quite fascinated by
her.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Why not? She’s an attractive young
woman.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20
at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her
carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have
perished but for meeting some of our people.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Amazing! She still doesn’t look over 20.
When is she likely to grow old in appearance?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her
youthful indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Suppose she should leave it?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Leave Shangri-La! That’s not likely. You
couldn’t drive her out.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: No, I mean about her appearance. If she
should leave the valley - what would happen?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Oh, she’d quickly revert in her appearance to
her actual age.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: It’s weird. Chang, how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You
know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build
another fence around your minds.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, there you are! You’re just the man I’m
looking for.</p>
<p><strong>272. wider angle</strong>: As George comes up to them. He is
livid with rage. He crosses directly to in front of Chang.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A fine trick! Smart, aren’t you? What a pack
of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they
arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew
very well you’d tell them not to!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Now, my dear boy. You shouldn’t�</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ve been lying to us ever since we got
here! Apparently it’s worked with some people. Perhaps it’s because they
lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You’re up
against the wrong man. I’ll get out of here, if I have to blow this
fantastic place into the valley! I’ll get out�porters or no porters!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You must prevail upon him not to attempt the
journey. He could never get through that country alive.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I can’t let him go alone. It’s suicide!</p>
<p><strong>274. medium shot</strong>: Conway sits in the same place
before the Lama.</p>
<p><strong>lama</strong>: Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It
was to be expected.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I knew you’d understand. That’s why I came
to you for help.</p>
<p><strong>lama</strong>: You must not look to me for help. Your brother
is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Mine?</p>
<p><strong>lama</strong>: Because, my son, I am placing in your hands
the future and destiny of Shangri-La.</p>
<p><strong>lama</strong>: I knew my work was done when I first set eyes
upon you.</p>
<p><strong>275. closeup - conway and lama</strong>: Conway is too awed
and impressed to utter a sound. The High Lama finally resumes.</p>
<p><strong>lama</strong>: I have waited for you, my son, for a long
time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have
looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I
might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath,
for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care
for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages
without.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Do you think this will come in my time?</p>
<p><strong>high lama</strong>: You, my son, will live through the storm.
You will preserve the fragrance of our history, and add to it a touch of
your own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens.</p>
<p><strong>277. close shot - the high lama</strong>: From whose face the
glow has faded. There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed mask.</p>
<p><strong>278. closeup - conway</strong>: He stares, uncertainly, for a
long while, with a slow realization that the High Lama is dead. Quite
unaware that he is being moved emotionally, tears well up in his eyes.
While still sitting this way, unable to stir, he becomes conscious of
activity around him.</p>
<p><strong>279. medium shot</strong>: As two servants, unbeckoned,
arrive - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the Lama. Then, in intervals of
seconds, groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter softly and silently,
and gather around the High Lama. We hear indistinguishable murmurs that
might or might not be prayers. Conway is only vaguely aware of their
presence - and after a few moments, scarcely conscious of what is
actuating his movements, he drifts away from the murmuring Lamas, and
walks in the direction of the door.</p>
<p><strong>280. medium shot</strong>: Barnard and Gloria are on their
knees on the floor. Before them they have spread a large map or chart.
Barnard is enthusiastically out - lining his plans.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Look, honey. We run the pipes through here,
and we connect with the main water line here.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Oh, that’s a cinch. I’ll show them how to
cast pipes out of clay.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There you are! Barnard, you’d better get
your things together. We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Leaving?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes. I’ve just been talking with the
porters. They’re going to take us. We’ve got clothing, food, everything.
Come on!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: When are you going to start?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right this very minute! The porters are
waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop
me. Come along.</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: I think I’ll stick around. I’ll leave with
the porters on their next trip.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You mean you don’t want to go?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Well - I’m�</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I see. You’re afraid of going to jail,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing
business�</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right! If you insist on being an idiot,
I’m not going to waste time coaxing you. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Oh, no - you don’t want to go yet,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: If you want me to!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Sure - sure. Don’t you worry. I’ll take
care of you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, suit yourself. But just remember
you had your chance.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How about you? Do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Go? Where?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Home. Away from here. I’ve got porters to
take us back.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh, my dear boy, I’m sorry. That’s
impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t care what you’ve got started. Do you
want to go?</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Well - no - I think I’d better wait. Yes,
yes. I will. I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ll wait till you rot!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Yes. Barney!</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Lovey!</p>
<p><strong>282. med. close shot</strong>: As Lovett joins the two on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Hello, Gloria.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Barney, I’ve just finished translating one
of the most interesting old tablets you can imagine. It told me all
about the origin of the Masonic symbols and�</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: That’s swell, Lovey. I want to show you
something. Look!</p>
<p><strong>lovett</strong>: Oh my, isn’t that pretty! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>barnard</strong>: Plumbing. Everything modern. I’m going to
run pipes all through the village�</p>
<p><strong>283. close shot</strong>: Conway stands in front of a window
- his arms extended across - peering out moodily. He is watching a
solemn and slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers - the funeral
rites of the High Lama - accompanied by cermonial music and
drum-beating.</p>
<p><strong>284. long shot</strong>: Shooting over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>285. close shot</strong>: Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys
the surroundings of which he has just become master.</p>
<p><strong>286. close shot - at door</strong>: George appears in the
doorway. He looks around and espies Conway. For a moment he stands
uncertainly, and finally enters.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob�</p>
<p><strong>287. medium shot</strong>: As Conway turns - and seeing him,
evinces no emotion whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hello, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, you can stop worrying about everything
now, Bob. I’ve made arrangements to leave. If you’ll let me close that
window, I can talk to you. That noise is driving me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I said we’re getting out of here. Back to
civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of
books or something, and they’re leaving tomorrow at dawn. They’re
waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things
together. Where’s your top coat?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You can’t leave, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why not? What’s going to stop me?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You mustn’t. You’ve got to stay here
now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Stay here?! What’s the matter with you, Bob?
You’ve been acting strangely ever since we came here. I’ve never seen
you like this. Why can’t we leave? What’s stopping us?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Something grand and beautiful, George.
Something I’ve been searching for all my life. The answer to the
confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I’ve found it, George, and I
can’t leave it. You mustn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You’re carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If
you’ll only tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I will, George. I want to tell you. I’ll
burst with it if I don’t. It’s weird and fantastical and sometimes
unbelievable, but so beautiful! Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and
brought here . . .</p>
<p><strong>289. same scene:</strong>: As Conway is concluding his
story.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: . . . And that’s the whole story, George. He
died as peacefully as the passing of a cloud’s shadow. His last words to
me were, “I place in your hands, my son, the future and destiny of
Shangri-La.” Now you know why I can’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: So you think I’m mad?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What else can I think after a tale like
that? Good heavens, Bob, things like that don’t happen today. We’re
living in the twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: So you think it’s all nonsense, huh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think you’ve been hypnotized by a lot of
loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn’t believe it if I heard it in an
English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you
know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I don’t need any proof.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I knew there was a reason I hated this
place. I’d give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just
for what they’ve done to you. How do you know the things they told you
are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas
being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth
certificates? I can’t believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit
around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway -
two-feet-on-the-ground Conway - want to join them. It’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Is that all my story meant to you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What else could it mean to me? It’s
obviously a lot of bunk.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Then you’d better go, George. This is no
place for you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s no place for you, Bob. Think of what’s
waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you’re half dead? Until
your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Please, George. I don’t want to talk about
it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ve got to talk about it. What about me?
You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn’t want to come.
You owe me some responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I’m tired of owing you things. You’re free
to go. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s that girl - that girl has twisted and
turned�</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Enough! Never mind the girl! Well, why don’t
you go?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember,
you’ve looked after me. Now I think you’re the one that needs looking
after. I’m your brother, Bob. If there’s something wrong with you, let
me help you.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Oh, George . . .</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Besides, I - I don’t feel like making that
trip alone, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, you couldn’t possibly stay here,
could you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’d go mad!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac.
But I believe in this, and I’m not going to lose it. You know how much I
want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than
brotherly love. I’m sorry, George. I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I can’t think of anything more to say.
Goodbye, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, are you sure of the porters? About
their taking care of you, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh yes. It’s all set. Maria made the
arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Maria?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, the little Russian girl.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: What’s she got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s going with me.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George, you’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You can’t take her away from here!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Because you can’t. Do you know what will
happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She’s a fragile thing that can
only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley
and she’ll fade away like an echo.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean - “fade away like an
echo”?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: She came here in 1888!</p>
<p><strong>291. close shot - the two</strong>: Favoring George. He
laughs hollowly. He runs his hand through his hair. He stares
unbelievingly at Conway.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This would be funny - if it wasn’t so
pathetic. Why, she isn’t a day over twenty!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You’re wrong, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she
wouldn’t have to tell me. I’d know anyway. I found out a lot of things
last night.</p>
<p><strong>292. med. close shot - the two</strong>: Conway stares at
him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La?
Nobody would ever think of leaving?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I don’t believe it! I don’t believe a word
of it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right. I’ll prove it to you! You believe
everything they’ve told you - without proof! I’ll prove my story!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve got some bad news for you, Maria. My
brother and I have decided we can’t take you along.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You can’t take me?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: But you promised me! You promised to take me
with you!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It’s all your fault! It was all arranged
until he spoke to you! Why can’t you leave us alone?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Do you mean to tell me you want to leave
Shangri-La?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’ll die if I have to stay here another
minute! I’ve waited a long time for this chance to go, and you’re not
going to stop me now. If I have to, I’ll go alone. It was I who bribed
the porters. If it weren’t for me, you’d never get out!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I thought the porters had instructions from
the High Lama not to take anyone.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him?
The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much
gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I’ve been stealing
it for a year. I’d do anything to get out of this place. To get away
from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why,
he’s been insane for years!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Father Perrault is dead.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He’s dead? That’s fine. You won’t see me
shedding any tears over him! Oh George, you must take me with you!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Aren’t you afraid to leave? You don’t want
to look like an old woman, do you?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Old woman? Chang told you that, didn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I thought so! He tells everyone I’m old. He
wants them to stay away from me. He can’t stand it when anyone comes
near. He’s punished me for every minute I’ve spent with George. If it
weren’t for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always
stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark
room. I nearly went crazy. Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old
woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if
these are the eyes of an old woman?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She was kidnapped and brought here two years
ago just as we were, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: I don’t believe it! I can’t believe it.
She’s lying. You’re lying. You’re lying! Every word you’ve been saying
is a lie! Come on, say it!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You’re lying, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No, Mr. Conway, I’m not lying. What reason
could I have for lying? The chances are that we’ll never come out of
that horrible trip alive, but I’d rather die out there in a snowstorm
and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: You say the porters are waiting for us?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: The clothes?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, everything!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: What about the others?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve already asked them. They’re afraid to
make the trip. We’ll have to send an expedition back after them.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Come on! We’re wasting time!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>294. med. close trucking shot</strong>: Conway, George and
Maria on their way out of the main building. The funeral procession
continues around them. The two men walk together, Maria behind. George
is cheerful and buoyant.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It won’t be long now before we’re in London.
Can’t you just see everyone when we pop out of the blue!</p>
<p><strong>295. med. shot</strong>: As Conway, George and Maria
continue.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ll have them breathless when they hear
our story.</p>
<p><strong>296. medium shot - chang</strong>: As he hurries out of the
building and looks out at them from a roof terrace.</p>
<p><strong>george’s voice</strong>: You had me worried for a while. I
thought you were gone completely.</p>
<p><strong>298. three shot</strong>: Conway, George and Maria. George
glances up at Conway.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it,
too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was saying�</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Can’t you shut up? Must you go on babbling
like an idiot?</p>
<p><strong>299. long shot</strong>: Sondra has come running out to stand
anxiously beside Chang.</p>
<p><strong>300. med. close shot</strong>: Sondra and Chang.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: What’s happened? Where’s Bob?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: He’s going, my child.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Going?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: But he will return.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Oh no! No! Bob!</p>
<p><strong>301. trucking closeup - sondra</strong>: As she runs, calling
out Conway’s name and weeping.</p>
<p><strong>302. a series of shots</strong>: Showing Conway, George and
Maria - accompanied by a dozen or more porters - as they approach the
mountain opening where they first entered Shangri-La.</p>
<p><strong>303. closeup - conway</strong>: He hesitates at the opening,
looks back one more time. His eyes show confusion and defeat. George,
ahead, calls out to him to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>305. a series of shots</strong>: Which should be a group of
portraits - showing the group’s seemingly impossible journey back to
civilization. These pictures should be accompanied by music in the
appropriate mood.</p>
<p><strong>306. night shot</strong>: Accompanied by the porters, they
trudge laboriously through snow-ridden plains.</p>
<p><strong>307. day</strong>: The whole caravan are seen in the
distance, clambering up a mountain-side - hoisted by ropes.</p>
<p><strong>308. night</strong>: In the middle of a vast plain. They
attempt to put up tents, which proves futile, as a raging snowstorm rips
the canvas from its moorings.</p>
<p><strong>309. day</strong>: The large group are seen lowering
themselves in single file down a ledge alongside a ravine. The wind
howls.</p>
<p><strong>310. day</strong>: A mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm
swiping viciously across their faces. They edge their way pre-cautiously
across a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses her bearings - slips -
screams - and is caught by Conway just in time to save her from falling
down the side of the jagged mountain.</p>
<p><strong>311. med. shot - night</strong>: Maria has one arm around
George and the other around Conway - limping. She has her head down.
They trudge silently. The porters are off in the distance, leaving them
behind.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I can’t stand it. I can’t go on anymore! I’ve
got to rest.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: How long is this going to go on? I can’t
stand it, I say.</p>
<p><strong>312. med. shot</strong>: Of the porters, laughing at their
distress.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob, can’t you get them to wait for us?
They’re leaving us farther behind every day.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: There’s nothing that would suit them better
than to lose us, but we must go on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No, I can’t! I can’t! You’ve got to let me
rest! You’ve got to let me rest!</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>314. med. shot</strong>: Of the porters, still laughing. The
lead porter whips out a gun and fires at them for sport.</p>
<p><strong>315. med. shot - the three</strong>: They are in no danger.
The porters are too far off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Target practice again! One of these days
they’re going to hit us.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: As long as they keep on aiming at us, we’re
safe. Come now, child.</p>
<p><strong>316. med. shot</strong>: Of the porters. They are still
laughing, and now others have drawn out their guns. Firing off wildly,
they trigger an ominous thunder overhead.</p>
<p><strong>317. med. shot - the three</strong>: Looking up, they see an
avalanche beginning.</p>
<p><strong>318. a series of shots</strong>: Of the avalanche, picking up
strength and fury as it crashes downhill, sweeping over the porters and
crushing them to death.</p>
<p><strong>319. close shot - the three</strong>: An immense silence
comes over them. Conway and George can only stare, dazed and frightened.
The only sound is Maria, sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>320. medium shot - day</strong>: A scene in which Conway
carries the girl on his back. George walks behind. The wind continues to
howl.</p>
<p><strong>321. closeup - george</strong>: Staring at the girl’s face as
it hangs over Conway’s back. Suddenly, his eyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>322. closeup - maria</strong>: A distorted view of her. Youth
and beauty seem to be vanishing.</p>
<p><strong>323. closeup - george</strong>: His eyes are glued on
her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob! Bob! Look at her face, Bob! Her face!
Look at her face!</p>
<p><strong>324. medium shot - night</strong>: On the backs of the two
men, who bend over Maria. CAMERA DRAWS BACK as they straighten up. Both
stare down aghast at the girl, whom we do not see.</p>
<p><strong>325. another angle</strong>: To include the girl.</p>
<p><strong>326. med. shot of the three</strong>: The only illumination
comes from the moon. We cannot get a clear view of her face. But what we
see seems to us to be small, withered and aged. She is dead. The men
stare at her intently.</p>
<p><strong>327. close shot - the two men</strong>: Who watch her,
immobile. George looks despairing. Slowly his head turns toward the
cliff behind him - and his eyes become alert with an idea. His face
lights up with great determination. He lets out a piteous howl, and
breaks away, racing out of scene.</p>
<p><strong>conway</strong>: George! George!</p>
<p><strong>328. a series of shots</strong>: George stumbling toward the
cliff, Conway chasing him. George, falling head over heels, rocking on
the edge - then plummeting over, falling down, down into the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>329. wider shot</strong>: Conway, at the end of the cliff,
peering starkly downward.</p>
<p><strong>330. a series of shots</strong>: As Conway soldiers on,
alone, through howling wind and snow.</p>
<p><strong>331. med. shot - night</strong>: On Conway, struggling
against a cyclonic wind. He tops a rise, stumbles, falls over, and rolls
down the mountainside, until finally he comes to a stop, mounded by
snow. Slowly, he begins to rise and start again.</p>
<p><strong>332. dawn</strong>: As the sun comes up, Conway emerges from
the whiteness, feeling his way forward with a walking stick. He walks
with the pain and effort of a blind man, and just as he manages to cross
a bridge spanning a great chasm, the bridge collapses. He stumbles
on.</p>
<p><strong>333. day</strong>: Conway, looking haggard and more dead than
alive, stumbles out onto more dry and level terrain. He collapses to the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>334. medium shot</strong>: A group of Chinese in front of
huts. They look up, see something off and commence shouting excitedly in
their native tongue.</p>
<p><strong>335. medium long shot</strong>: Conway’s body from their
angle.</p>
<p><strong>336. a series of shots</strong>: Newspaper headlines:</p>
<p><strong>337. full shot - outer section</strong>: CAMERA MOVES FORWARD
passing a series of desks and clerks until it reaches a clerk who is
opening several cablegrams. Finally he comes to one which causes his
eyes to pop. Muttering something under his breath which sounds like
“Good heavens!” - and without taking his eyes off the cablegram, he
rises and starts away.</p>
<p><strong>338. med. trucking shot - clerk</strong>: As he strides
across to the end of the outer office - to a glass-panelled door upon
which we read “ASSISTANT TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY” - through which he
disappears.</p>
<p><strong>339. full shot</strong>: As the clerk enters, full of
excitement.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Cable from Gainsford.</p>
<p><strong>assistant secretary</strong>: Oh, read it!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: “Leaving today for London with Conway aboard
S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering
from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford.”</p>
<p><strong>one of the others in the room</strong>: Loss of memory?</p>
<p><strong>assistant secretary</strong>: All right, give it to the
press.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: All of it?</p>
<p><strong>assistant secretary</strong>: Yes. Might as well - all of
it.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>assistant secretary</strong>: I’ll dispatch a convoy to meet
him.</p>
<p><strong>340. a series of shots</strong>: More newspaper headlines
reporting that Conway has amnesia and other details of his homeward
journey.</p>
<p><strong>341. full shot</strong>: Another clerk enters with haste,
bearing another cablegram.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Conway’s gone again! Run out! Listen to this!
From Gainsford.</p>
<p><strong>assistant secretary</strong>: Let me have it. “Aboard the
S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept
talking about Shangri-La, telling a fantastic story about a place in
Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he
escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship
myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details
of Conway’s story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord
Gainsford.”</p>
<p><strong>342. a series of shots</strong>: More newspaper headlines
indicating Gainsford has abandoned his pursuit of Conway and returned to
London.</p>
<p><strong>343. full shot</strong>: A scattering of men are present -
some at the bar - others at tables.</p>
<p><strong>344. med. shot in a booth</strong>: Several men are
seated.</p>
<p><strong>carstairs</strong>: Here’s Gainsford now.</p>
<p><strong>345. long shot</strong>: From their view. We see Gainsford
standing in the doorway, looking around. He spies them and starts
forward.</p>
<p><strong>346. medium shot</strong>: As Gainsford arrives at the booth.
The men rise with extended hands.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: Well, it’s good to see you back, Lord
Gainsford! Thought you were never coming.</p>
<p><strong>meeker</strong>: Will you have a drink? Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>347. med. close shot at table</strong>: As Gainsford shakes
hands with them, and sits down.</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Yes. Scotch and soda. I’m parched.</p>
<p><strong>robertson</strong>: Here you are, ready and waiting.</p>
<p><strong>carstairs</strong>: We’re most eager to know what you’ve
discovered.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: Any news of Conway?</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Gentlemen, you see before you a very
weary old man, who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly ten
months.</p>
<p><strong>meeker</strong>: Do you mean to tell me you never caught up
with him?</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Since that night that he jumped off the
ship until two weeks ago, I’ve been missing him by inches.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: You don’t mean it!</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: Think of it!</p>
<p><strong>robertson</strong>: He was as determined as that to get
back?</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole
course of my life, I have never encountered anything so grim. During
these last ten months, that man has done the most astounding things. He
learned how to fly, stole an army plane and got caught, put into jail,
escaped . . . all in an amazingly short space of time. But this was only
the beginning of his adventures.</p>
<p><strong>348. close group shot</strong>: Favoring the other men, as
Gainsford continues.</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Of course he had already gone. But his
memory - ah - his memory will live with those natives for the rest of
their lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they called him. They’ll never
forget the devil-eyed stranger who six times tried to go over a mountain
pass where no other human being dared to travel, and six times was
forced back by the severest storms. They’ll never forget the madman who
stole their food and clothing - whom they locked up in their barracks -
but who fought six of their guards to escape.</p>
<p><strong>349. med. close group shot</strong>: Gainsford still
continues.</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Why, their soldiers are still talking
about their pursuit to overtake him, and shuddering at the memory. He
led them the wildest chase through their own country, and finally he
disappeared over that very mountain pass that they themselves dared not
travel. And that, gentlemen, was the last that any known human being saw
of Robert Conway.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Think of it!</p>
<p><strong>carstairs</strong>: By jove, that’s what I call
fortitude!</p>
<p><strong>robertson</strong>: Tell me something, Gainsford. What do you
think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Yes - yes, I believe it. I believe it,
because I want to believe it.</p>
<p><strong>350. close shot - gainsford</strong>: As he lifts his
glass.</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Gentlemen, I give you a toast. Here is my
hope that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La!</p>
<p><strong>351. close group shot</strong>: They all raise their
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>gainsford</strong>: Here is my hope that we all find our
Shangri-La.</p>
<p><strong>352. closeup</strong>: MOVING IN FRONT OF CONWAY - as he
walks forward with a steady step - his head held high - his eyes
sparkling - snow pelting his face.</p>
<p><strong>353. long shot</strong>: Over his silhouetted back.</p>
<p><strong>354. another long shot</strong>: He has now ascended to the
middle of the steep hill - his gait unchanged. THE CAMERA PANS UP to the
summit of the incline - and we see that beyond it the horizon is filled
with a strange warm light. Conway’s figure - in silhouette - disappears
over the hill - bells ring - and as the music begins to swell</p>
