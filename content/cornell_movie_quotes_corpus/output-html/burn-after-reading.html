<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Ozzie. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Palmer. What’s up.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: You know Peck, and Olson.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by reputation. Hi,
Osbourne Cox.</p>
<p><strong>olson</strong>: Yeah, hiyah.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Aren’t you with…aren’t you, uh…</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. Oz, look. There’s no
easy way to say this. We’re taking you off the Balkans desk.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: You’re—-what? Why?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: In fact we’re moving you out of Sigint
entirely.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: …What? No discussion, just—-you’re
out?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Well, we’re having the discussion now Oz.
This doesn’t have to be unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Palmer, with all due respect—-what the
fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … And why is Olson here?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: … Look, Ozzie—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: What the fuck is this?! Is it my—-I know
it’s not my work.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Ozzie—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I’m a great fucking analyst! Is it—-</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Oz, things are not going well. As you
know.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: You have a drinking problem.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I have a drinking problem.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: This doesn’t have to be unpleasant. We found
you something in State. It’s a, uh…</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: … It’s a lower clearance level. Yes. But
we’re not, this isn’t, we’re not terminating you.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: This is an assault.</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Come on, Ozzie.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: This is an assault. I have a drinking
problem? Fuck you, Peck, you’re a Mormon!</p>
<p><strong>peck</strong>: Ozzie—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Next to you we all have a drinking
problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass didn’t I kiss? Let’s be honest!</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Okay, Olson—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Let’s be fucking honest…</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … This is a crucifixion! This is
political! Don’t tell me it’s not!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … I have a drinking problem!</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You’re home.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Hang on to your hat, honey. I have some
news. I—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Did you pick up the cheeses?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Were they ready? I didn’t know you were
coming home this early.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: The cheeses.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I left a message for you to stop at Todaro’s.
The Magruders and the Pfarrers are coming over.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: The Pfarrers? Ugh. I—-what did Kathleen
say?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: When you left the message?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: She said. She would give you. The
message.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Well she, I don’t know, I guess we had
bigger news today. My day didn’t revolve arou—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: So you didn’t get the cheeses.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Well, since I didn’t get the message, no,
I didn’t get the cheeses. But hang on to your hat, I—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Oh for fuck’s sake, Ozzie, you mean I have to
go out again? All right, well, you better get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Honey, we have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Not right now. They’ll be here in, what, less
than an hour.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is this a, uh, goat cheese?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Because I have lactose reflux. But I
can—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: You’re lactose intolerant?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, but I can—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Or you have acid reflux? They’re two
different things.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know what they are.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Then you misspoke yourself. So I—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thank you for correcting me.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You should try the chevre, Harry. It’s very
good.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. I can eat goat cheese.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I was just explaining to your husband here,
I have a condition—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Harry works with the Marshalls’ Service.</p>
<p><strong>doug magruder</strong>: Ah. I’m on the legislative side, I
work with Senator Hobby.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Used to work for Treasury, but I didn’t go
over to Homeland Security. I’m with the Marshalls.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: If you want he’ll show you his great big
gun.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Very amusing. The gun is actually no big
deal. Twenty years in the marshall’s service and I’ve never discharged
my weapon.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Sounds like something you should be
telling your psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What? I don’t have a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>doug magruder</strong>: Boy, I guess my job is pretty
undramatic. I’m on the legislative side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do
you also carry a gun?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sandy writes children’s books.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I write children’s books—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oliver The Cat Who…Who..arghh—-Who—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …Who Lives In The Rotunda. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Those are wonderful! My nieces and
nephews—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, it’s a beloved series. You wouldn’t
believe her fan mail. Unghh. Are you sure this is goat cheese?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Why don’t you let your wife tell them about
her own books, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m sorry—-was I—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Here, come in the kitchen, help me with the
crudit�s.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Goddamnit. He knows, doesn’t he.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Nice floors.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Knows what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: About us, he knows about us. Little
prick.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Don’t be an ass, he doesn’t know a thing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What is that, forbo?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What a horse’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know why we see them.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, she’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You quit?!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Well—-Thank you for letting me know!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I tried to tell you this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You tried? You tried? And then—- what, the
aphasia kicked in?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Our guests came. We—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Why?! For fuck’s sake, Ozzie!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I’m just—-I don’t know. I got so
tired.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You’re tired.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Tired of swimming against the current.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Independent thought is not only not valued
there, they resist it, they fight it, the bureaucracy is
positively—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Did you get a pension, or severance or
something, or—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I didn’t retire you know, I, I quit. I
don’t want their benefits.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: But I suppose my benefits are all right, I
suppose you can live with those, is that the idea?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: It’s not like that’s the only way to make
money.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Yes? Yes? What’re you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I’ll do some consulting.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Consulting.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yes, to help while I—-I’ve always wanted
to write.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Write. Write what.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I’ve been thinking about it. A book, a
sort of, sort of memoir.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: You okay there, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … Dad, I left my job at the Agency…</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … I, uh… I’m sorry. Dad, government
service is not what it was when you were in State. Things are different
now. I don’t know, maybe it’s… it’s… the Cold War ending; now it seems
like it’s all bureaucracy and no mission…</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … I’m writing a memoir. I think it’s going
to be pretty explosive. But I don’t think you’ll disapprove. I don’t
think you’ll disapprove. Katie has had trouble accepting it.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: But… sometimes there’s a higher
patriotism, Dad. So we’ll… Yes, change is hard. It’s hard on Katie. But
we’ll be okay. We’ll be okay. Life is change. This is good. We were all
blocked up, Katie and me. This is, this is a blessing in disguise. I’ll
go into training, you know. Lay off the sauce. Like you did. You managed
to do it. Finally. And then I can concentrate on, you know. New
beginning. And this’ll all have been for the best. Don’t you think
Dad?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … Cold.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … I guess we should head back.</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: We’ve seen this…</p>
<p><strong>terikhian</strong>: … I know this kind of man. We’ve seen
this.</p>
<p><strong>terikhian</strong>: … Mrs. Cox, you can’t let this man take
advantage of you. And he will. He will.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Yes. This is my fear. He’s trying—- he
says—-he’s trying to pull himself together, but…</p>
<p><strong>terikhian</strong>: Look, sure, I—-I’m obliged to tell you
you should try to salvage things. And you should. People turn themselves
around. Not unheard-of. But. You—- you haven’t broached the possibility
of divorce yet?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>terikhian</strong>: Well that’s good. Because first you
should get all his financials. Before he’s forewarned. Because here’s a
man, here’s a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say
it’s his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is
not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the
household finances. Paper files, computer files, whatever—-this is your
prerogative. You can be a spy too, madam. Do this before you put him on
alert. Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh…</p>
<p><strong>terikhian</strong>: … Feet.</p>
<p><strong>terikhian</strong>: … And hopefully everything will work out.
He will reform. But! If not: forewarned is forearmed.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: We were young and committed and there was
nothing we couldn’t do. We thought of the Agency less as… less as…</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … The principles of George Kennan—-a
personal hero of mine—-were what animated us. In fact they were what had
originally inspired me to enter government service. Like the State
Department’s China Hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a
different venue, in a different medium, in, um… “Murrow’s Boys,” the
fabled—-in a different—-</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: You have reached The Cox Group…</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: … We can’t answer your call right now.
Please leave a—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … Yes?… Oh, no… No, call her number… No,
upstairs…No she’s not, but leave it on her machine.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Single…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I should try to get a run in.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Ozzie!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Tune every heart and every voice…</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: … Bid every care withdraw. Let all with one
accord rejoice…</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: … In praise of Old Nassau…</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: … In praise of Old Nassau my boys, Hoo-rah,
hoo-rah, hoorah!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: … Her sons… shall give… while they… shall
live…</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: … In praise of Old Nassau!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We take all the chicken fat off your
buttocks, here… and here… And the upper arms. And a little off your
tummy…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: …And we do breast augmentation with a tiny
incision here… and here.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: Uh-huh. And what about the thigh area?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well we can do liposuction there as well,
but that area will respond to exercise. Buttocks and upper arms begin to
store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to
go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my arms
til the cows come home, but…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Uh-huh. And of course there are also genetic
factors.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: The Litzkes are big.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Uh-huh, well everything’s—-</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: My mom had an ass that could pull a
bus.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Wow. Well that’s a predispo—-</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: Father’s side too, although Dad tends to
carry his weight in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: In the gut area. Derriere, not so much.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: And what about the face, you know, the window
to the soul.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Very well put. Well your
eyes are one of your best features. But we can do something about the
incipient crow’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Baby crow’s feet. Little chickling’s feet. I
mean chicks. Chickie chickie chickie.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Ha-ha, yes, again, well put. You have a way
with words. We cut here…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: … And we pull the skin tight, like
stretching the skin over a drum. Not too tight, though. We don’t want
that “worked-on” look. You need sufficient slack for the face to remain
expressive.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, I don’t wanna look like Boris
Karloff.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Uh-huh! Heh-heh, so you don’t want a sex
change!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, I’m all woman!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: So Linda, what we’re talking about here is
four different procedures. The liposuction… The rhinoplasty… The facial
tuck, which I would strongly recommend over the chemical peel—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, I don’t want to get anything burned
off.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: And why should you. With that lovely skin.
And lastly, the breast augmentation. Now we can also do something about
the vaccine scar—-I don’t know if you wear sleeveless dresses much—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Not with these ham hocks!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes, well once they’re nice and svelte,
post-op, you—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well I don’t know. Is the vaccine thing—-can
you counsel me on this? I don’t know, is it unsightly? I see it a lot, a
bunch of people have it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Absolutely! Some women don’t mind it at all!
Personal taste!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Chad!</p>
<p><strong>patron</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I’m sorry, was that too much?</p>
<p><strong>patron</strong>: I felt a straining… a tightness in the… in
the front of my ass…</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well you’re pretty tight. You have to feel it
or—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Chad Feldheimer. Office.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute. We’ll work on
opening those hips.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I got a batch from BeWithMeDC dot com.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Oh wow. Any good?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t know yet, just looking… How do you
open this?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Click on, uh… yeah…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh my God, what a loser!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Loser!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Loser!… What is this! They should call this
Mr. Saggy dot com.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Cripes.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Loser!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Did you have to send a picture?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, only guys do. I submitted a verbal
profile, turn-ons, turn-offs, et cetera. I’m really looking for someone
with a sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: That guy—-wait—-that guy wasn’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: No, before.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yeah. He uh, he might not be a loser.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: That’s a Brioni suit.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Shit yeah.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Does he look like he has a sense of
humor?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: He looks like his optometrist has a sense of
humor.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: … Huh-huh-huh. What does he do?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: State Department.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: That’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: His hair is… what is that?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Plugs.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is the cardio area. A lot of machines
here so that, believe me, there’s never a wait. What you’re seeing now,
this is our busiest time, and there’s still a couple of open treadmills
I see, three Stairmasters—- I call it the Butt-Blaster—-couple of
LifeCycles—-Hi, Chad.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Hi Linda. Did you call that guy?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Not yet! Chad is one of our trainers. I’ve
just started internet dating and I got my first look at the, uh…</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: What service?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: BeWithMeDC dot com?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Have you used them?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: No—-two friends did and they’re both
hooked up. With really special guys.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … English!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Agent!</p>
<p><strong>linda driving</strong>: … Agent! Agent!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke, should I
give you my account number? You have it up? Okay. I was informed that I
needed pre-approval for these surgeries, and then… Yes, it was
denied.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: …No, those are four different operations…
It’s very complicated; I’m reinventing myself, it’s a whole new look so
it isn’t just one thing, however, it’s all approved by my doctor…
But—-madam! This is not—-my job involves, you know, public interface!
This is not…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Yes I do understand. Could I speak to your
supervisor please?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Alan?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Are you, uh… Linda?</p>
<p><strong>dermot</strong>: First you tell me that you can’t commit,
then you—-WOULD YOU GET DOWN</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh for Pete’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … and then, you know, you grow up. I guess
that’s what’s happened with me. You just… people change. We married when
I was, what, in my mid- twenties. A kid. We were kids. Twenties. You
think it’s forever. Then, you know, you’re older—-you begin to feel your
mortality, you start to think, well, there’s no more time for
dishonesty. Subterfuge. You go, I’m not that person. The choices you
made, you can’t, just through inertia—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I’m thinking of divorcing Ozzie.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I’m just thinking, Whoa. I mean, frankly,
I’m thinking, Whoa. I, I, I guess that’s what I should be thinking about
too. With Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: That’s what you were just saying.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes! Absolutely! And you should be getting
rid of that bozo. No question about that. I agree.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: So if I were divorced—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well yes, if you were uh, you know, yes. Yes,
I should settle things. With Sandy. Because of you and me. It just
takes, courage, you know. To inflict that pain. Scary stuff.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Scary stuff. You’re a brave lady. Well, of
course, it would be easier for you.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Why’s that? I don’t see that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well you know, because he’s such a dope. But
Sandy, she’s… a good lady. A very special lady.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: She’s a cold, stuck-up bitch.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well that’s… a little—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You and I should sort things out. I’ve told
you that this is not just frivolity.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, that’s understood. You’ve been very
straight.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I thought I was loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Absolutely. Not just fun and games.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: English!… Agent!… Agent!…</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: —-important to us. Please stay on
the line for the next available agent.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Ted, can I talk to you about our Mickey Mouse
health plan?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh-huh… Hang on…</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: This is some heavy shit.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Is that my date list?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: No… fuck…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You know, I’m trying to reinvent myself, and
these procedures, which are so incredibly not cheap, this Micky Mouse
HMO is saying they’re not, they’re… What is this?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I can’t believe this… This is like…
intelligence shit.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I am not comfortable with this.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: This is, like, I can’t believe this shit I’m
seeing.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Manolo found it.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Manolo found this, like, CD just lying in a
locker. Locker floor. Ladies’ locker room.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Jus lie-een there.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: And I’m like, whoa, someone’s music or what,
so I come in here and it’s these files, man.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I am not comfortable with this.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Like it’s talking about SigInt, and signals
and shit. Which, Signals means code, you know.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: It was jus lie-een there.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Talking about like, section heads here, and
their names and shit. And then these other files are just, like,
numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates and numbers… And numbers. I think
that’s the shit, man. The raw intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I am not touching this. I want this out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Wul… Throw it out?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You can’t do that! You should put a note up
in the ladies’ locker room.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Put a note up? Highly classified shit found,
Signals intelligence shit, CIA shit? Hello! Did you lose your secret CIA
shit? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, you figure it out, I am not comfortable
with this. I want this out of Hardbodies…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … We’re running a gym here!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Look, Manolo…</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: …you didn’t find this.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: I found it on the floor there.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yeah, I know, but�</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Right there on the floor there. Lie- een
there.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Harry? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, yeah, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Absolut Saketini, please?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Just a Tab.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You know, it wouldn’t cover all of it, but if
I got some advance on my salary I could at least get the surgery ball
rolling.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Whoa! There’s a payroll company, you know. They
don’t just advance people money. They just don’t do that. I mean, sure,
I could say, Yes, I authorize it, but that’s not going to mean anything
to them.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well why do they have us on a cockamamie
health plan? I need these surgeries, Ted!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re a beautiful woman! You don’t need�</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Ted, I have gone just as far as I can go with
this body! I—-</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I think it’s a very beautiful—-it’s not a
phoney-baloney Hollywood body—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s right, Ted, I would be laughed out of
Hollywood. I have very limited breasts and a gi-normous ass and I have
this gut that swings back and forth in front a me like a shopping cart
with a bent wheel.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh come on!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I am trying to get back in circulation. I
have appetites and so forth, and, uh—-</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well there’s a lot of guys who’d like you just
the way you are.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah—-losers!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, I don’t know. Am I a loser? Lemme tell
you something. I wasn’t always a manager at Hardbodies. I, um…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Let me show you something.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Omygod—-is that you?!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
Congregation in Chevy Chase.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well jeez, that’s a good job!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … It’s a long story. Anyway, lotta ways I’m
happier now. My point is… my point is… it’s a journey.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well that’s my point! I don’t want to stay
where I am! I want to find someone to share my journey!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, sometimes, you know, you don’t look in
your own back yard, you’re never gonna see—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s right! That’s why I’ve started this
internet dating!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh-huh, but I’m saying, maybe you don’t have
to, you know… to—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Look Ted, I know you can’t authorize an
advance on my salary but you can put in a request, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s not going to do any good, Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Ted, have you ever heard of the power of
positive thinking?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hurrow—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hello?… Where are you?… Okay. Just a
second.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Omygod.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Omygod.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Chad, you know what time it is?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Uh-huh. So, like, I couldn’t tell you this on
your totally unsecure phone, but I know who the guy is.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The guy?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: The guy, the secret guy.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Is he high up?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Um. I don’t know if he’s high up. Probably. I
mean, I know his name, not like his rank.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Osbourne. Cox.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Oh, like you’re so plugged in to the
intelligence community.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m just saying, to the layman—-</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well I think like the quality of the
intelligence dictates how high up he is.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Not what we know.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: And I also got his—-do you have any water? I
gotta hydrate.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I have tap water</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How did you find out who he is?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Sources.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What do you mean sources?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Do you have like Gatorade? Anything besides,
like, Maryland swamp water?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: … You know how far this is from my place?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How do you know his name?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos? He
does computer stuff, hooks up people’s computers and programs their
VCRs’n shit? So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital
watermark that tells what computer they were created on. Fucking child’s
play for Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I also have his telephone number. That was a
little harder.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Omygod!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Shall we give him a tinkle?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Omygod, why?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Because he’s gonna wanna know that his shit is
secure. You know, he’s gonna be relieved. He might even be so relieved
he gives us a reward—-I would be very fucking surprised if he did
not.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, wow.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Very surprised. Like, you know, the Good
Samaritan tax. Which is not even a tax, really, since it’s
voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Osbourne? Osbourne Cox?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yes—-uh—-Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Are you… uh… Osbourne Cox?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Who is this? What time is it? Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I’m a Good Samaritan. I’m sorry I’m calling at
such an hour, but I thought you might be worried.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Worried?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: About the security. Of your shit.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: What on earth are you talking about? Who
am I speaking to?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Your files—-your documents. I know these
documents are sensitive. But I am perfectly happy to return to you your
sensitive shit. At a time of your choosing.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: What documents? What are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: … Osbourne Cox?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yes! Yes, I’m Osbourne Cox! Who the
fuck�</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Settle down, Osbourne.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: What documents are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: OK. “The bureau chief in Belgrade we all
called Slovak the Butcher. He had and his despatches were marked
by—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Ra-por, very little rapport with his
staff, you fucking moron! How did you get—-</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Don’t blow a gasket, Osbourne. I have—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: How did you get a hold of that!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: It’s not important where I—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: You’re in way over your fucking head! Who
the fuck are you? You have no idea what you’re doing!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Oh! Why so uptight, Osbourne Cox? I’m just a
Good Samaritan, like, a traveler on the road who has happened upon—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We’re going to return it, we just
thought—-</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Linda, I’ll do it!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Who’s this?!</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Ozzie, what is going on.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Like a Good Samaritan tax—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Who the fuck—-</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You know, this is a major inconvenience for us
and we thought, you know, a reward—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: So it’s money! So it’s money!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well, yeah, uh… why not? I mean, this is
not—-am I out of line here?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: All right, you two clowns listen to me
very very carefully. I don’t know who you are, but I warn you most
emphatically—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You warn us? You warn us? You know what, Mr.,
Mr. Intelligence? We warn you! We’ll call you back with our demands!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Hello? We just—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Who, who—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Chad! Don’t play his game!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Hello! Hello!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: … Geeze…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The nerve of that guy!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: … I am very fucking surprised he did not give
us the reward.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What in God’s name is going on?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: There’s some clown—-a couple of clowns
—-somehow got a hold of my memoir—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Your what?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Stole it or—-I have no idea how they got
it—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Your what?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: My memoir, the book I’m writing.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Why in God’s name would they think that’s
worth anything.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Well they—-I… I’ve no idea how they got
it.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: But it doesn’t sound like he’s gonna play
ball.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, he’ll play ball! We just have to let him
know who’s boss.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well, that’s—-he sounds very senior. I think
this is some senior guy who has screwed the pooch, big-time.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, that’s why we got him, you know, we’ve
caught him with his thing caught in a big fat wringer.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yuh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: And us in the driver’s seat. This is our
opportunity, like, you don’t get many of these. You slip on the ice
outside of, you know, a fancy restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yuh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Or this happens.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: And right now this has happened.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yup. It sure has.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This could put a big dent in my
surgeries.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Big time.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Honey!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Honey!</p>
<p><strong>harry’s voice</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: My cab is here, I’m off. Mystery man.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: … What is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh baby. Top secret.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … You’re gonna knock ’em dead.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … How many cities?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why do they always have you do Seattle. Not a
big market.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I don’t know, lots of independent bookstores.
Rains all day, what are people gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I can think of a couple of things.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You can think of one thing.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It better be the Peninsula. The money I make
for them. Are you gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll be sad. But I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Not too sad..</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just the right amount.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I am crazy about you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>bogus</strong>: Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison and Zoe Caldwell.
It was marvelous. First time I’ve attended the Kennedy Honors. Jane
Alexander is a client. Old friend of Zoe’s. What an actress. Anyway…</p>
<p><strong>bogus</strong>: … Connie, could you bring in your copy of the
Cox financials?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I thought I had it here on a disk—-I
don’t know where the disk is. I’m sorry, I’ll have to run another off my
hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>bogus</strong>: Tony sang “The Best Is Yet To Come.”
Mr. Bennett.</p>
<p><strong>bogus</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>bogus</strong>: So. We’ve drawn up the papers and are
prepared to execute service on Osbourne if you so elect, Mrs. Cox. Our
missiles are pointed at his capital, so to speak, and we await only your
word. But, be mindful, madam: once these missiles are launched, there is
no recalling them. We are not picking daisies. We are declaring war, and
hostilities will then impose their own logic. I think you understand
what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It’ll piss Ozzie off.</p>
<p><strong>bogus</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Mr. Terikhian, I have given my husband second
chances galore. There are limits to my charity.</p>
<p><strong>bogus</strong>: Of course. But since we are at the point of
no return, I always urge my clients at this juncture to give it one more
day of reflection.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Yes. Understood.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Harry? I’m Linda.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, I did the whole bodyguard thing for
years. My guy was in State, the Secretary in fact, so of course I
traveled a lot.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …“Ironside is leaving the building.” We
called him Iron Ass.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Not to his face, of course. Not to his ass,
either!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Ah, he was okay. But, Personal
Protection—-that’s a young man’s game.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You wanna try these dumplings? They’re
delicious.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Does it have shellfood in it?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Shellfood?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: `Cause I have this sensitivity. I, uh, go
into anaphylactic shock. My larynx swells up, closes off the—-Ah what
the hell.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Live dangerously—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Can’t always wear a condom.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s right! Not always!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anyway, my job’s more administrative now, not
so much PP. Personal Protection. Though I still carry the gun.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Omygod, really!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s no big deal. Never discharged it, twenty
years service. Security blanket now. I don’t think about it—- course,
you’re not supposed to think about it;</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: in a situation where your man is threatened
the training kicks in. Muscle memory. Reflex—-Those are outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Wanna swap?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: —-but there was just a hell of a lot of
political infighting, petty, petty, shit, and then basically the old man
stepped on Goldberger’s throat. Nice…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Wide-plank pine?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Listen, full disclosure here Linda…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I’m not wearing a wedding ring but I am
married. Took the ring off, what, eighteen months ago when we agreed to
separate. Agreed to disagree. That’s about the only thing we ever agreed
on.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Thanks for telling me. I really do appreciate
it, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, full transparency, the only way
to—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s not gonna go off, is it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well let’s go in the other room and find out!
Grrr!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s great. That sounds… exciting.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s very very communicative. Very
accessible. He has a sense of humor. And he agrees one hundred percent
about my surgeries.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, I—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He thinks my ass could be smaller. I mean,
not in a mean way, he kidded about it—-he’s got a terrific sense of
humor.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s good, but… but… Linda, what do you
really know about this guy?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I told you, he’s in the Treasury Department
and he—-</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But he could be one of these people who, you
know, who cruises the internet—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, so am I!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, you can’t go like that! You gotta wear a
suit.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well—-you mean—-go home and change?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I was gonna ride my bike. Do I have time?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: —-which to my mind is all the more reason to
lower the boom on Ozzie.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: That’s it? “Mm”?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m just… wondering if it’s the right
time.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Of course it’s the right time. Why wouldn’t
it be the right time. Does it threaten you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No no. No, you and me are rock solid. That’s
why I, uh, I think we can afford to be big. We can think about Ozzie,
whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you
hammer him with, um—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Is that how you see me, “hammering” him?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Of course not, but—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Weren’t those your words?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, but—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I don’t “hammer.”</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, uh-huh, of course not. But, I’m
saying—-I’m no friend of the guy. You know that. I think he’s an
arrogant little geek. But for Christ sakes, you and me have all the time
in the world, and he just lost his job—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: He didn’t lose it, he quit.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Most of the people who “quit” in this
town were fired.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I feel sorry for the guy. And he’ll be
easier to deal with when he doesn’t feel… cornered.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Maybe. As long as we’re talking about Ozzie
and not you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Of course we’re talking about Ozzie. Baby, I
stand by you whatever you do. I adore you.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Please get the check.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: …Yes?… Yes?… Is there blood in his
stool?…Yes, soon.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It’s after two. I have to get back to
work.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Osbourne Cox?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: And you, I take it, are “Mr. Black”?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yes I am. You have the money?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: The fifty-thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: That’s what was agreed upon, Osbourne Cox.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: All right. Let me explain something to
you, “Mr. Black.” You know who I am; I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Perhaps. But appearances can be—-
deceptive.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yeah. What you’re engaged in is blackmail,
which is a felony. That’s for starters.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Appearances can be—-deceptive. I am a mere
Good Samar—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination
of classified material is a federal crime. If you ever carried out your
proposed threat, you would experience such a shitstorm of consequences,
my friend, it would make your empty little head spin faster than your
Schwinn bicycle over there.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You think that’s a Schwinn?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Now give me the fucking floppy or the CD
or whatever the fuck you have it on, and I will—-</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: As soon as you give me the money, dickwad! I’m
not—-Huhgf!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: … You fuck!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Give it to me, fuck!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You fuck! You fucker!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I know who you are, fucker!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: You’re the fucker!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: He hit me!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where’s the money?!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: He didn’t give it to me�</p>

<p><strong>chad</strong>: We, um… we know our rights.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is just a taste.</p>
<p><strong>new embassy man</strong>: There is more material?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s a lot more. But we need to be
paid.</p>
<p><strong>new embassy man</strong>: You are not ideological.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Look, I have a date.</p>
<p><strong>new embassy man</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Date.</p>
<p><strong>new embassy man</strong>: … We will examine the material. How

<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh! Come on downstairs. Do you like
surprises?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well, I’m very open to new experiences…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I gotta tell ya—-I saw an ad for this in a
gentleman’s magazine—-twelve hundred bucks. I take a look at this thing,
I think, Jesus, you gotta be kidding—-I’m a hobbyist, this is basically
nothing but speed-rail, I could probably go to Home Depot and whip this
up myself for, like, a hundred bucks…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … What is it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What is it. You siddown, feet in the
stirrups, and…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Omygod!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … It’s fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Isn’t that somethin’? Hundred bucks all-in if
you don’t count my labor. And the, you know—-cost of the dildo. Those
things are not cheap.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But I lack the, uh, I’m not set up to mold
hard rubber.</p>

<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well maybe we can.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: That’s all Manolo found! That was everything!
What’re we, gonna tell Manolo to scoop some more secret shit off the
locker room floor!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t like the snideness! Nor the
negativity!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m just trying to work this thing! If I’m
going to reinvent myself I need those surgeries. And those surgeries
cost money! This is not just fun and games!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yuh-huh. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: So let’s figure this thing out!</p>
<p><strong>public address</strong>: Chad, your Berry Blast is ready.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We know who he is</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Right: Osbourne Cox.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: So we can find out where he lives, right?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Um. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You should change. Into your suit.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: So you don’t look out of place in the
neighborhood. There are certain elementary things.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: His neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes. We’ll remove the laundry marks and
labels. And you should not be carrying ID.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Laundry marks?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Deniability.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>public address</strong>: Chad, your Berry Blast is
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s the odometer say?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: About five or approximately five? I

<p><strong>katie</strong>: For fuck’s sake, Harry, it’s five miles. Five
point two.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, fine—-I gotta do at least five. Five
and a deuce is okay.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I’m surprised you have any energy left.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You kiddin’—-pull around the corner we’ll do
it again in back!</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You are very coarse.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, back of the car. I didn’t mean a
rear-entry, uh—-</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Ach. I’m late—-</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Nuhhh!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Hello?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Hello?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hungh!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Hello?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Omygod. Omygod.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Omygod who are you. You fucker. Omygod.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … You fucker…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Omygod, my god… Ungh…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Omygod…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … What the fuck…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Oh my fuck…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I killed a fucking spook. You fucker…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … What are you doing here, you fucker.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Olson. What’s up.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Palmer. What’s up.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Not quite certain, sir, but it’s… messy.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: … Kolyma-2 tells us that they have computer
files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osbourne Cox.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Kolyma-2?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Our man in the Russian Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: It was brought to them by a woman who—-</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: The Russians?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yeah. It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an
associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer. Picture’s in the folder. With
Pfarrer’s.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: The Russians.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Who’s Pfarrer?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Treasury agent who’s been, um, screwing
Mrs. Cox. Must be how they got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows about it,
they all seem to be sleeping with each other.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: All right. Spare me.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yes sir. But this Treasury guy—-it’s gotten…
complicated. He just shot somebody in Ozzie’s house.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Shot—-your analyst?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Ozzie wasn’t there. Our man surveying hears
a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy wrestle something into his car, follows
him; he dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Well—-what’d he do that for?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Don’t know sir.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the
body out?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Russian? American?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Don’t know. Scrubbed of ID.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: And this… Linda…?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Linda Litzke.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: She’s Treasury?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: No, we’re—-um… fuzzy on her.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Well—-so—-we don’t really know what
anyone is after.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Not really, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: This analyst, ex-analyst, uh…</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Cox.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Yeah. What’s his clearance level.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Okay. Okay, no biggie…</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: … for now just keep an eye on
everyone, see what they do.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Right, sir. And—-we’ll interface with the
FBI on this, uh, dead body?</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: No! No, we don’t want those idiots
blundering around in this. Burn the body. Get rid of it. And keep an eye
on everyone, see what they do. Report back when, um, I don’t know. When
it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: To the left!… Repeat!… To the right!… Repeat!…
And in!… And out!… And higher!… Repeat!…</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I’m bigger… I’m back… I’m better… I’m
back… than ever… I’m back… fuckers… I’m back…</p>
<p><strong>man on tv</strong>: … And good!… Repeat!… Now bend!… And
bounce!… . And lower!… Repeat!… And up!… And back!… And up!… Repeat!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m fine, Ted, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You don’t look fine.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No no, I’m… I’m…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You won’t tell me what it’s about. You never
let me in, Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, I know you’re trustworthy, I just… don’t
want to endanger other people with—-I mean, it’s a path I’ve chosen,
it’s not, you have to isolate, you know, a firewall.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh-huh. Well, I don’t know what to think. You
both go AWOL on Friday; today Chad doesn’t bother to come in at
all—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda, I can’t run a gym this way.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m going to have to fire him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No! No no no, Ted! Just, just. . .</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Give me twenty-four hours!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: To what?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: To, um… I don’t know, twenty-four hours!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Just give me twenty-four hours to solve this
thing!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda. I have to tell you. A man was here
earlier asking about you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Foreigner?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda, are you in some kind of trouble? Is Chad
running from something?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Ted, we know what we’re doing. Let me ask you
this: did he know my name.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Whuh—-yes, he was asking about you. Employment
history, et cetera. Real jerk. I told him to get lost.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Thank you, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, we…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … we just don’t give that out at
Hardbodies.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Linda, there’s a Mr. Krapotkin on line

<p><strong>linda</strong>: Is he—-I don’t know what the term is, did he,
“go over”?</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Do you know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: Is he not… at Hardbodies?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, I—-look, can I come in and discuss

person.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: … What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ve tried. To ignore it. And stay
upbeat.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Harry: stop the foolishness.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Stop the foolishness?</p>

<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Sandy?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Hi, it’s Osbourne Cox, how are you.
Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: … Hi.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but I
have a, well, a publishing question and I thought you might be the
person to ask, I have this manuscript, something to do with my
professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but I think
it’s pretty explosive stuff and I think that it could merit a fairly
wide readership handled properly and it isn’t quite finished yet but
there’s a situation where I’m worried about it leaking now and maybe
excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my
permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so I’m actually
anxious to bring it to market sooner than I’d planned—-I mean, like now,
in fact—-so I was thinking, I know you, and you seem to do well, so I
was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. The people you
use.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You’ve written a children’s book?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but
—-doesn’t your company have an adult arm? Or isn’t it, uh, the
children’s arm? Of a regular publisher?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Pappas &amp; Swain do children’s
literature.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Uh-huh. I see. So they don’t—- okay… Are
you well?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Very well thank you. And you.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yes. Good. Okay, well, thank you
Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Yes. Good talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: Yes, madam. Can we help you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are you
running?! I’ve been waiting here for fifty-five minutes, and I’m—-</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: I am so sorry, madam. An urgent
matter.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well this could be urgent too, since, you
know, Chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and—-</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: I don’t know the whereabouts of Chad,
madam.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well he was gathering information for you
when he—-</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: We’re not interested in such
“information”. It was drivel.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Dribble!</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: Would you like your disk back?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Dribble!</p>
<p><strong>krapotkin</strong>: I’m so sorry I can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll tell you what’s dribble! You listen to
me, Mr. Krapkin! I am—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … What?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … Yes… No… Yes, I want to know why the
check for my slip fee was returned for insufficient funds… Slip fee, for
docking my boat, the check was returned… No, m’dam, it’s not zero, I
have about forty thousand dollars in that account… When? … When?… But
she can’t do that—-no, yes, technically it may be a joint account but
she doesn’t use it, it’s not her money… No! No! What access, it’s not
possible! Without my permission? What about the, my, the, our savings
account? My savings account?… I don’t know the fucking number! You think
I memorize the fucking numbers on my fucking bank accounts! Moron!…
Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No-o-o-o-o-o way. No way. Whoa. No way,
Linda…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: … No.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But Ted, I can’t do it, I don’t know anything
about computers.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda, the whole thing is crazy. It was crazy
the first time, and you want to do it again? Break into the man’s house?
And why would—-why would—-you said the Russians didn’t even want this
stuff!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: My world is bigger than that, Ted. There’s
other people. There’s the Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda, these surgeries—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s not just the surgeries, Ted! It’s not
just the money! We can use it as leverage! To get Chad back!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What do you mean “get him back”!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Information is power, Ted! Hel-lo!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What do you mean “get him back”! You don’t know
where he is!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Somebody has him. And we can—-</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You ask the police to help you find missing
people! And you—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I can’t take it! I can’t take it! I can’t
take it! You know I can’t do that! We’re operating off the map here,
Ted! This is way higher than the police, it’s higher than that!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Linda, I—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I need a can-do person, Ted! I hate your
negativity! I hate all your reasons why not! I hate you! I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>bartender’s voice</strong>: What’ll it be.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Seven &amp; Seven.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hurrow—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Hello?</p>
<p><strong>filtered voice</strong>: It’s Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You think a marriage is… and then you…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But this was a long time coming.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Was it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Well, yeah… right…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re depressed, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I am depressed. I gotta exercise. I haven’t
run in three days… butt- crunches… anything… Do you think I could stay
here for a little while?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … What? What’s wrong, baby?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It can’t always come from me, Harry! I’m not
that strong!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s wrong, baby? Harry’s here.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re not here for me! I need a can- do
person! You’re all… defeated!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m sorry, baby—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Chad is the only can-do person I know and
he’s gone, Harry, he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll be good. I’ll be better. I just need to
exercise. Are there pedestrian paths around here?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Who the fuck is Chad?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Could you help me find him? He’s a friend
from work. You know law enforcement people, right? You could call,
unofficially?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait a minute, what’s his name? What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared. He
hasn’t been at work or at home for two days.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know his social security number?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Huh? NO! I—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s okay. That’s okay. What’s the last place
you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t know! He just disappeared! The last
place I saw him was the Jamba Juice on K Street. And he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay baby. We’ll find your friend. Missing
person. Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: No, stay open…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: … You have to let the doctor look in
your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: … Now you listen to me, young man.
You do as I say or I’ll ask your mother to leave the doctor’s office and
the two of us will sort out what’s what.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: … Yes.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: … With a patient.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yeah? The same patient she’s been with
since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT!</p>
<p><strong>filtered voice</strong>: Dr. Cox has suggested you call her
attorney—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new
fucking keys!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: New keys…</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: And it was just then—-at that very
moment—-that Oliver sneezed—-</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Can we just—-I’m sorry to interrupt but we have
to let the folks at home see this illustration! Can we just get a shot
of that…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: There—-there it is. Oliver. Interrupting the
filibuster with—-</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: That’s wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Wonderful! The book is “Point of Order,
Oliver!” and the talented author is Sandra Pfarrer. We’re gonna go to a
station break and then be right back with Bud Fraighling, the Sultan of
Salad, and Part Two of our special interview with Dermot Mulroney. So
keep it where it is!</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: …Great segment.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Yeah, you know we thought it might be fun if
you joined us with Bud Fraighling and help make the Fiesta Salad, when
we move over.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Over on the kitchen set.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: That wasn’t discussed.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Oh, sure! No! Only if you want to! Your segment
went great, we just thought—-</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I’m sorry, I made plans.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Okay, great!</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Great to see you again, Sandra!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: New… fucking… keys… How’s this for
access…</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … How’s this for motherfucking access…</p>
<p><strong>pr woman</strong>: That was way out of line. We were so
unbelievably clear with them: just an Oliver segment.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>pr woman</strong>: Del and Connie are such putzes.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It’s fine. Thank you. We’re finished.</p>
<p><strong>pr woman</strong>: Huh? Well, okay. Great, uh—-</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Thought that would never be over.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Mmm. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Let me scrub this crap off my face.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Just for starters…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hello there sunshine. You look great.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well you seem better.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time this
morning. And our exercise last night didn’t hurt!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Harry!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Boy, I am through banging my head against the
wall. I am gonna start doing what’s right for me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s how I believe, also. You have to do
what’s right for—-</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a shock
recently, and I realized you know, life is not infinite. No one’s
immortal.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No one’s immortal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You have to get from each day its full, uh,
squeeze the juice from every day because there but for the grace of
God—-</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Exactly. The important thing is to maintain a
positive outlook. Always up. Always ebullient.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s right, don’t sweat the small
stuff…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … and it’s all small stuff.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is where we first met. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You never know what the important days are,
until… until, um…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … I told myself I was gonna stop being
paranoid, but… is that guy looking at us?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Have you found out anything about Chad?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nothing yet, I’ve made a couple calls. I
don’t think it’ll take long.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh yeah, there are so many data bases now
it’s a joke…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … Back when I was in PP there was still some
art to finding people. Not any more. And now with the cell phones?
Pretty soon they’re gonna know where everyone is. Everyone. At any given
moment. I mean it’s almost the reality now. You would be amazed.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did he—-when you left the Jamba Juice —-did
Chad say anything about where he might be going?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, I know where he was going.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: A residence in Alexandria. On Hillsboro
Drive.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … 2055 Hillsboro.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … It’s, um. The residence of a guy named
Osbourne Cox.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m … just … Linda Litzke.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Harry!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Ow! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh for Pete’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: And you are… my wife’s lover.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Then what are you doing here.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … I know you. You’re the guy at the
gym.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m not here representing Hardbodies.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: I know what you represent. You represent
the idiocy of today.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t represent that, either.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Oh yes. You’re the guy when I went to ask
about that moronic woman.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: She’s not—-</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: You’re in league with that moronic woman.
You’re part of a league of morons.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Yes. You’re one of the morons I’ve been
fighting all my life. My whole fucking life. But guess what. Guess what.
Today I win.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … Oooph!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: … Stop! Intruder!</p>
<p><strong>osbourne</strong>: Intruder!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: … Wait a minute. Where’s the treasury
guy? Pfarrer?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Right now?</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: In a detention room at Washington
Dulles.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: … Why?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: He was trying to board a flight to
Venezuela.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: We had his name on a hot list, the INS
pulled him. Don’t know why he was going to Venezuela.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: We have no extradition with
Venezuela.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Oh. Uh-huh. Well—-what should we do with
him?</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: For fuck’s sake, put him on the next
flight to Venezuela!</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yes sir. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Okay. So the gym manager is dead.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>gardener chubb</strong>: The body is—-</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Gone, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gardener chubb</strong>: Okay—-</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: But—-there was a, uh… snag…</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Well. This analyst, Cox, was attacking the
gym guy. It was broad daylight, on the street. Our man there didn’t know
what to do. He felt he had to step in.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: He, uh… He shot the analyst. He shot
Cox.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Good! Great! Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: … He’s in coma. They’re not sure whether
he’ll make it. They think, they’re pretty sure he has no brain
function.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Okay. Okay. If he wakes up we’ll
worry about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck. That’s it then. No one
else really knows anything. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Um. Well sir, there is…</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: There is the woman. The gym woman. Linda
Litzke.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Oh yeah. Fuck. Where is she.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: We picked her up. We have her.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Can we, uh—-</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: She, she, she says she’ll play ball if we
pay for some… I know this sounds odd—-some surgeries she wants. Cosmetic
surgery. She says she’ll sit on everything.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: How much.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: There were several procedures. All together
they run to, um—-</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Pay it.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yes sir. Should I pay it out of, should it
be from—-</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: One of the black accounts, I don’t
give a shit. The January fund. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Jesus. Jesus fucking Christ.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: … What did we learn, Palmer.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: I don’t fucking know either. I guess
we learned not to do it again.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Although I’m fucked if I know what we
did.</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yes sir. Hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>gardner chubb</strong>: Jesus. Jesus fucking Christ.</p>
