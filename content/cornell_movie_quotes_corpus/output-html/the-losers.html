<p><strong>man</strong>: No… please… There’s no way…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Nothing… can defeat… A SHADOW FALLS across the
sand. Then a second. One looks like a Dog’s Head. The other like…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Gojira.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me love you long
time!</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: C’mon Jensen, you in or not?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: And get cheated again?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: The Pooch don’t cheat. The Pooch may lie, the
Pooch may steal– 2.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: –the Pooch may refer to himself in the third
person–</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: –but the Pooch will not cheat.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: The Pooch can rest easy, I was referring to
Cougar.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: It’s Liar’s Poker, Jensen, how in the hell is
the man gonna cheat you at Liar’s Poker?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Cards. The four take them. Lick the back,
slap them to their foreheads – two deuces , a three , and an eight .
Pitiful cards.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Got a feeling about this one, Roque.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Your mama had that feeling too.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Raise you.</p>
<p>****: That the one with the hollow points?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Oh, shit, I’m definitely in then.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: This even me up?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Exactly how many knives do you have,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Cougar - your bet.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, losers!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s time…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Authenticate and backtrace.</p>
<p>****: Send us out to the middle of nowhere to “wait for
instructions”…</p>
<p>****: We’re good, this baby came out of the Kandahar Spook Station,
controller’s codename is Max.</p>
<p>****: This is an Agency gig?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We don’t get to pick what needs to be done.
Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is running a terrorist assembly line out
around the Khyber Pass–</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I’m shocked. Shocked, I say.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We find it, we paint it for a laser targeted
bomb. No muss, no fuss.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: For that we had to put on a blindfold and
turn around three times?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: You’d rather take on fifty mujas with
AK’s?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I got eyes on Fadhil.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Paint it.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Call me Michelangelo.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed eyes
on, target is designated.</p>
<p>****: Roger, target acquired, exfil chopper is enroute. ETA to
fireworks is eight minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Roger, we’ll break out the earplugs. So who
wants to get a game? We got eight minutes-</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Boss?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Call it in.</p>
<p>****: Dropkick, children are at target site, repeat, we have eyes on
children at target site - advise.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Hold the line…</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Acknowledged, maintain position.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Maintain position? Colonel-</p>
<p>****: Dropkick, we strongly recommend cancellation of payload
delivery-</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Abort order can only come from</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mission Controller is Agency, Codename Max,
repeat, Codename Max, so get him on the horn and-</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Already have, Pinball, your orders
stand. Prep for exfil.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Cougar?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting equipment
has suffered system failure, am calling an abort.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, that was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Who is this? This is a secure</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Very stupid, Colonel… Franklin… Clay.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Max? There are children on site-</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And you think I didn’t know that? Not the
sharpest of knives in the drawer, are you? We locked coordinates the
moment you painted; delivery will occur on schedule. Max out.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Shit! Jensen, call the General at the
Firebase, get him to abort-</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Can’t, they’re jamming us-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Then contact the plane directly-</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Negative, we’re screwed!</p>
<p>****: There’s nothing we can do… 8.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: There’s something we can do.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Five against a fortress, and we’ve got maybe
six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: So, I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I guess we’re going with the fifty mujas with
AK’s option after all!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for the kids,
the rest of us will be out in five-</p>
<p>****: -airstrike’s in four and change-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: -out in four. On me! 9.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Get ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: …shooooot meeee…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re American?</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: …Max sent you…</p>
<p>****: How do you know that name?</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: …was IA Field Ops hunting rogue
agents… Max caught me…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Max is rogue?</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: You’re off-mission aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: What’s the mission?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Fadhil.</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: Max doesn’t care about Fadhil…
He’s cleaning up the mess. You’re his mop. I’m the mission….</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: Kill me…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I can get you out- 11.</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: Already dead… Kill ME-</p>
<p><strong>something horrific</strong>: Thaaaank…</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What kind of blast radius we looking at?
Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an animation mock-up
to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I think we’re in the clear-</p>
<p><strong>in the middle of the firestorm</strong>: All Pooch can see is
FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the destruction.
Glances in the REAR-VIEW:</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Uh, Coug?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yeah, that was great, wasn’t it? My favorite
part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Exfil incoming. How are we gonna explain the
kids, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Colonel? The kids. What do we tell ’em?
13.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Lieutenant, you’re to evac these civvies to
the Firebase immediately-</p>
<p><strong>blackhawk pilot</strong>: Negative, our orders are to
transport a five-man team only.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You really want to leave twenty three kids in
the desert to die?</p>
<p><strong>blackhawk pilot</strong>: Not enough room for them and
you…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Then it’s them.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Cute little buggers. Hope they can make it to
our court-martial. 14.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Relax, Pooch, we’re not going to be
court-martialed - if anything, we’re going to die of thirst wandering
the desert, right Colonel?</p>
<p>****: Jensen, see if you can cut into that Blackhawk’s chatter–I want
to know if he rats us out.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: So, how we getting back? Hitchhike? Magic
carpet? I say magic carpet…</p>
<p>****: Guess they hustled up some air support after all - that’s a
Pakistani MiG up there…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Guys… This is bad…</p>
<p><strong>mig pilot</strong>: Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked, twelve
o’clock low… Their eyes go wide with understanding….</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit.</p>
<p>****: Fox One.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Auto-rotate, go with it, you can still put
her down if you-</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And again.</p>
<p><strong>mig pilot</strong>: …Fox Two. The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG
SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK proper. Burning, spinning… FALLING. Clay and
Cougar, screaming by the time they reach the wreck…</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: What are you talking about “MAX?”</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: He set up the Operation-</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: There was no operation! You were never
radioed orders!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I talked to him! 16.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably
lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is
“MAX?”</p>
<p>****: Wait - are you saying you’re Max?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Colonel, Max is an Agency code for a rogue
agent or operation-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What are you talking-</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: There is no specific Max.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: “Max” is catch-all for exactly what you’ve
been accused of. Terminology’s been around since the 50’s.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We didn’t kill those kids, Wade. Wade studies
him. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Stay here. We’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Wade left his suitcase. 17.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Ah, shit…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Jensen?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I’m not good with bombs, man-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t care–Roque, Pooch, get those bars
off!</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Oh, shit. Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Time?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: It’s a remote detonator–enough for them to
get clear, maybe ten</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I told you, I’m not good with bombs! How are
those bars coming?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Hurry… 18.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Hurry…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Shut up…</p>
<p><strong>wide on the city block</strong>: As the SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES!
Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar being held two
blocks East. HOLD on the smoldering ruins.</p>
<p><strong>ext. new hampshire airbase – night</strong>: As the Marines
SALUTE the passing coffins. POOCH’S WIFE lowers her head, weeping. CUT
TO:</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert strip mall – night</strong>: Phoenix, Arizona. A
late night internet cafe, wedged between a donut shop and spinning
studio. JENSEN sits. Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT…</p>
<p>****: You lost again.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We lost again.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You placed the bet.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You gave me the money. 20.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Well, that was stupid of me, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: That makes, what, three in a row?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You know where you’re messing up? You’re
putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah, I’ve just gone crazy with that
approach.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Never play a longshot, you’re never gonna
win.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: We’re at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. - could this
get any more sleazy?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Maybe if we were drinking.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You’re not drinking?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We’ll stay two more days, try to get some of
the cash back.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Miami. Jai-Alai.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I can’t take much more of this.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We’re on the run. It occasionally</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I’m serious. Grinding out lunch money on five
dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow
stares at my face for more than two seconds-</p>
<p>****: I’m at the point where I’m thinking we ought to try to reach
out to the Company…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: All we did was say the word “Max” and they
blew up a building. CIA even gets a whiff of where we’re at, they’ll
call in an airstrike. Until we figure out how we can take Max down and
get clear, we lay low.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Due respect, you’re nobody’s Colonel
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Anytime you want to move along you go right
ahead- 22.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Like the others? Least I still talk to them.
You pushed them away. “Max this, Max that” - we never even saw the guy,
Clay-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We heard his voice. Guy with a voice is a guy
with a throat. And if he’s got a throat…</p>
<p>****: We’re hiding out in the parking lot of a goddamn McDonald’s–You
actually think we’re in any position to take on some shadowy CIA super-
spook?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: No, it’s a stellar plan - we can use this as
our base of ops!</p>
<p>****: Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can
set up communications by the slide!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Go. Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get
out of the cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I was there too. I remember. But he won. We
lost.</p>
<p>****: Maybe it’s time for a new game. 23.</p>
<p><strong>particularly offensive guy</strong>: Yabba Dabba Doo…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Men.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: How’s the steak?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Meaty.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Want a bite?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I don’t eat red meat.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Slows me down.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: You got nice arms.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I know you?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Relax, slugger… I like arms. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Do I not look relaxed?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: Think we can change that?</p>
<p>****: Wow, it’s everything a girl could dream of. Got a bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No, I specifically requested the only hotel
room in the world that doesn’t have a bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: You lookin’ to turn a “yes” into a “no”
here?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: So what brings you to Florida?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Convention.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Convention for what?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: …Air conditioners.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: They have whole conventions devoted to air
conditioners?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’d be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Bet I would. Where were we?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You were about to tell me how much you enjoy
spending time at the dog track… Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down
his stomach…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Saw me there did you?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Uh-huh…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Didn’t see me at the McDonald’s though…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I have a proposition for you…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Just hear me out. I don’t want to hurt
you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re not going to.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>viscous</strong>: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists
SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Room’s on fire.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Noticed. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Your life. Back.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You want to clarify that?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Max. I can help you. 27.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: It’s not too tough if you know where to look.
You guys aren’t exactly subtle.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: How’d you know I was alive?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Counted the number of teeth found in the
safehouse debris in Karachi. Not nearly enough for five men.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Who else knows?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: That you’re alive? Just me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So what’s to stop me from putting a bullet in
your head?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: You want Max and I can tell you how to get
him.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Max is up to something big, isn’t he? Agency
wouldn’t have sent you otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Nice try, but I’m working alone here. If I
wasn’t, I wouldn’t need your help. Ready for the important part?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: There is a plane.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: This plane contains a truck.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: This truck contains a cargo.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: This cargo is very important.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Is this a riddle?</p>
<p>****: This cargo belongs to Max. You steal the cargo, Max comes
looking for it, you grab Max.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What a brilliant plan, and oh, so simple too.
What’s the cargo?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Right. So you want me to steal some super
secret cargo known only to you and the bad guy, and I’m supposed to do
this because you know the name Max and look good in a pair of jeans?
Sorry, sister. 29.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Hey! You really think I look good in these
jeans?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Bye…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Cargo’s heroin. Max uses it to fund his off
the books ops. And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late
Jamal al-Fadhil. Oh… does that name mean something to you?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: He used you to kill Fadhil and take over his
operation, that’s right. What did you think you were doing there in the
first place? Fighting for truth and justice?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: How do I know I can trust you?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Check my background. I’m an ex- Company
hitter. First job was a junior field officer in Shanghai. You can Google
it under Shanghai Hilton Decapitation.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I mostly Google porn. Then?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Two Chinese and an Italian arms dealer in
Bangkok. With my hands.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Show-off. Then? 30.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Then I stopped auditioning for you. This is a
check for ten grand-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We’re not mercenaries.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Operational capital, that’s all. You’ve been
waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You’re not gonna get
another. You want Max, this is it. He takes it. She hands him some
papers along with it.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Intel on the shipment. You check it out, you
check me out, you decide - are you in or not?</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: You know we cannot do this… We
cannot do what you ask…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell me - is this a moral issue or a financial
issue?</p>
<p><strong>fat scientist</strong>: A moral issue.</p>
<p>****: Really? You object morally to this deal?</p>
<p><strong>fat scientist</strong>: Yes. I’m sorry. Please leave…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, here’s what I’m hearing. I’m hearing
“No.” I’m hearing “Leave,” and I’m hearing “I’m sorry.” Is that what I’m
hearing?</p>
<p><strong>fat scientist</strong>: Please… you must leave…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Right. Okay, so that is what I’m hearing. Now,
I want you to listen. Listen carefully because I want you to hear this.
Wade? 32.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You gave me the nod.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A “hit him in the face” nod, not a “throw him
out the window” nod.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I thought that’s what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: At most–at most that was a “break his fingers”
nod. I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius. Granted his
weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that’s
no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think I speak for everyone here when I say
that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little
wasteful…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: …then again, it seemed to have had the desired
effect - toss Short Round out next.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: We have a different moral
perspective than our late colleague.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The hell you say.</p>
<p>****: I need one to test and one to use.</p>
<p><strong>short scientest</strong>: One to test?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Of course one to test - you think I trust
you?</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: We will need much money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You will have much money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Call our people at Goliath, tell them we’ll
have a special package arriving on the 17th.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: So this is what your girl came up with, huh?
34.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Better than a ball pit…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You sure you’re thinking clear on this? I
know you. When you slip, it’s always cause of a woman.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Name one time that-</p>
<p>****: Carla.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Carla wasn’t the problem, Carla’s husband was
the problem-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Carla’s husband wasn’t the one who</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Okay. Yes. She shot me.</p>
<p>****: But only in the leg.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What about Emma?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Emma doesn’t count, we never slept
together.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Because she put a bomb in your car.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I admit, that took some of the romance out of
the relationship. 35.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: And now this chick, first time you meet her,
burns down our hotel. Also, she kills people for a living. These are not
good signs…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m clear, Roque.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You better be. Or we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Damn. We missed you too.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: So what’s this I hear about Clay gettin’ us
killed over a girl?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Been a long time since anyone called me a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Jesus, Lady! Ten outta ten for stealth and
shit, but next time could you just knock?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: How long you been back there?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Long enough.</p>
<p>****: She put a bomb in your car? 36.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: She was volatile. Aisha, meet Pooch, Roque,
and Cougar.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Really? You can’t hang out with anyone just
named “Phil”?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Hail, hail, the gang’s all here! Colonel.
Roque. Pooch. Silent Bob. Hottie.</p>
<p>****: I’m gonna need a moment alone with the boys if you don’t mind,
but I’d like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I’d expect no less.</p>
<p>****: Have fun…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What do you have on her?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Besides a pants-busting crush?</p>
<p>****: Her intel checks out. The cargo will be arriving here in two
days.</p>
<p>****: Wow, I completely trust her now.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad
was white devil… oh, and CIA’s got a kill order out on her.</p>
<p>****: 37.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD– pretty
much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick amscrayed.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Last CIA email flagged with her name says
she was digging for information about a special project… “Codename:
MAX”. A moment as this sinks in.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: They want to wet her cause she’s lookin’ into
Max. That sounds familiar…</p>
<p>****: Could those files-</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: -have been planted for us to find? CIA
timestamp, digital watermark… Someone would’ve had to go to a lot of
trouble, and I mean a lot, to fool me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I say we go with her. Pooch?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Jensen? 38.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Hell yeah. Cougs?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: For now.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Hot damn! Back with the Colonel, doing
another bid for God and</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Country turned her back on us, and God can
screw. This one’s for us.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: And anyone who calls me “Colonel” better be
ready to take a beating or an order. We ain’t soldiers anymore.</p>
<p>****: So what’s the plan, my civilian brothers?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sleep. We start tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Start where?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We’re going bird hunting.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It used to be so simple. A post 9/11 world…
39.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: As a country we spoke with one voice, moved
with one purpose. We had a wicked boner for doing the right thing, and
now look at us!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack
us and we’re too busy losing our nerve to notice. It’s Us versus Them
and right now my money would be on them…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wasn’t it Thomas Jefferson who once said the
tree of freedom must be watered with etcetera, etcetera? We need to wake
people up, Wade. We need to hit them in the face, angry up the blood,
give them their balls back. We TRACK WITH our lead monkey up to
something very un- monkey like… Something SINISTER. A metallic, trunk-
like object. Flashing lights and transponder devices…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We need to give them a ten megaton reality
check. Boom Boom Boom Boom…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think it’s safe to say it works!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jeez, talk about hard to impress…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: The Company’s with you on this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Kinda… Sorta…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know the drill, they don’t like to know how
the sausages get made. What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I don’t. Just want to make sure everyone gets
paid.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The money’s coming from our Afghanistan
operation. And what the Company doesn’t know won’t hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Unless they’re within the blast radius.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re gonna saving our country, Wade. The
United States of America will benefit greatly from what we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I was born in Quebec.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jesus, fine - we’re saving North America, does
that make you happy? Just get it done.</p>
<p><strong>radio transmission</strong>: Base One, this is Cavalier 415.
Sector eight perimeter clear, proceeding to sector nine…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Roger that Cav 415, we have a report of a
civilian vehicle breakdown on U.S. 70, sector nine, grid four. Please
assist as required.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Army of one, my ass. Goddamn Triple A
service…</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: Need a hand, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: AAOW! Something just bit me!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: Is this…?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Make the call. 43.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Base One, this is Cavalier 415! We have been
in a collision with a civilian vehicle! Carvey’s dead an’ Freeman’s hurt
bad! He’s messed up his neck! He can’t move! Oh god, it’s horrible! We
need medevac immediate! HE’S GOT KIDS, BASE</p>
<p><strong>base one</strong>: Roger, Cavalier 415! We’re scrambling a
chopper, hang in there! Jensen, all smiles, looks up at Clay.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Robert De Niro who?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Sleeping like babies.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What about their ride?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Flip it. TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached
to the undercarriage of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the
ground… higher… Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: What do you think’s up with that “don’t call
me Colonel” stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Classic loss of identity. Clay defined
himself by his place in the military structure.</p>
<p>****: 44.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: It was his way of measuring the good he did
in the world. Without it, he’s just another loser like the rest of
us.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: You know there’s a website where you can
download MP3’s of donkeys farting? How cool is that?</p>
<p><strong>base one</strong>: Cavalier 415 this is Medevac Delta. Be
advised, we are airborne and in- bound to your position!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: All right, everyone get into character…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Lot of work to bum a ride.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Shut up, Jensen.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: You shut up, Roque. You’re dead, I’m the
spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can’t.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Stop talking or I’ll break your neck for
real.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Seriously, you have to get more into your
role! Dead guy! No talking! Dead guy!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Here we go…</p>
<p>****: Base One, this is Medevac Delta. We have visual on Cavalier
415.</p>
<p><strong>emt</strong>: Alright buddy, we’re gonna get you patched up
in no time…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Y-you ever treat anyone who’d been gut
shot…</p>
<p><strong>emt</strong>: Sure, in Iraq. What a mess…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Means you know what’s coming to you if try
to play hero. Now, lose the radio mic, Bones.</p>
<p><strong>pilot one</strong>: What are they jawing about out there?
We’re burning fuel–</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: You heard of car-jacked? You’ve just been
chopper-jacked, my man. 46.</p>
<p><strong>pilot one</strong>: You’re robbing the US Army?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: When he says it out loud, it does sound kinda
ridiculous…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Where’s my wild goose?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: We’re all set here. Ready to take a giant
step for… well, for guys who steal stuff, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Hit it.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Beautiful. Let ’em chase that.</p>
<p><strong>base one</strong>: Medevac Delta, this is Base One. What’s
your situation, over?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Time to move.</p>
<p><strong>drugged soldier</strong>: …Well, shit.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: …no, what you want is a gas turbine generator
running a force- fed rectifier unit, hook it up to the fuel tank…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush, huh? That
must’ve been rough.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Uh-huh…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Got any hobbies?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: When I was a girl, I collected human ears. I
had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night
and took them. The dog was good eating, though. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I’m gonna go somewhere else now.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Are small arms gonna be a problem?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: It’s taken care of - we lined the hull with
half inch steel plate. 48.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Which brings us to our next question…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What’s your angle in this?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Roque…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I’m giving you a chance to get even. That’s
all you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I’m gonna shoot her, Clay.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No, you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: She’s coming with us. And if anything feels
like a set-up, I put a bullet in her skull.</p>
<p>****: Sound fair? 49.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Oh, completely. Now, if you’ll excuse me,
it’s time for prayers.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You’re Muslim?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: You know, you are a sharp one–and don’t let
any of these other boys tell you different.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I picked up on that.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I’m with Roque, man. Agency thinks we’re
dead. We show up alive and kickin’, start waving our dicks around in
public, they’re gonna make it their business to bury us. They’ll call us
terrorists, all</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What do you think we are now? Best case
scenario, this gets us face to face with Max-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What if it doesn’t? What if we never get face
to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Hell, let’s just say it out loud…</p>
<p>****: We do this, we’re declaring war on the Central Intelligence
Agency.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: They started it.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: As of this moment, the truck is designated
an extraterritorial zone of immunity. Under no circumstances whatsoever
are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before it’s
secure in the compound - to do so would be considered an act of treason
and punishable as such.</p>
<p><strong>liddy</strong>: Understood and acknowledged, sir. As the
package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Ten men ride with the package and another ten
ride chase.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Are we wired?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Like Belushi.</p>
<p>****: Target is westbound. Heading for the bridge…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Take em’.</p>
<p><strong>swat driver</strong>: Shit, I’m losing it!</p>
<p><strong>ext. crescent city connection – day</strong>: Cougar FIRES
AGAIN – the other front wheel DETONATES, and the truck’s nose SLAMS down
on the asphalt GRINDING SPARKS! Going nowhere fast…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Form a defensive perimeter around the
truck!</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: They’re out of their minds, there’s no way
off this bridge…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Masks on! Secure the package!</p>
<p><strong>swat guy</strong>: Where are they? I can’t see them- 53.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Code RED! We are under attack! Need Chopper
Support right now!</p>
<p><strong>control</strong>: Acknowledged, EVAC is enroute!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Cavalry’s here!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Move! Point cover! Go, go!</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilot</strong>: This is Chopper Support–we are
inbound your position, ETA five minutes! Hang in there! As a HORRIFIED
LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade’s face and he stares up into the
sky…</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: What the hell? It’s welded shut!</p>
<p>****: The windows too! We’re sealed in!</p>
<p><strong>int. chinook cockpit – day</strong>: We hear the FAINT
YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips
up his goggles to reveal –</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: We’re down, okay! You go the second the ramp
lowers! Hit them hard, three round bursts, center mass!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Open the valve.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: These guys are about to get the surprise of
their lives…</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: What the hell they trying to do, drown
us?</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: Sir, that smell! It’s- gasoline!</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Eat the ground, or they blow your head
off!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: First and only warning, Clay!</p>
<p><strong>cherry</strong>: The soldiers, wide eyed…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think about it. AS
THAT SINKS IN – Fennel looks like his puppy just died.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Things’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Good boys. Now, let’s see what kind of cargo
you got in there.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we
all die. Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m already dead, remember?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Goliath the oil company?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: It must be how he moves the drugs…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Great. The super evil bad guy is in bed with
the world’s largest oil company. That’s just fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: You want me to go ask Fennel the
combination?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Nah, I can bypass no problem.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Voila! Ten million dollars of horse, comin’
up!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah. Jensen, you’re up.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: The bomb.</p>
<p>****: But I’m not good with bombs…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Get better.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>****: Nukes. That’s a nuke. Who makes nukes? Department of Defense.
DOD Mainframe. I gotta hack the</p>
<p>****: It would really be good if you didn’t talk right now- get that
casing off for me.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: What if that sets it off?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Then we die thirty seconds early - do it.
59.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I got wires - red, blue, green, white,
yellow-</p>
<p>****: Okay, just hold position!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: There’s also pink-</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Hold position!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Are you trying to make this more
dramatic?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Almost… Almost… Shit!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Computer crashed!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yes, cause this is the time for</p>
<p><strong>jensen-</strong>: 60.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I told you, I’m not good at bombs!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Do you have time to reboot?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Okay, someone pick a color!</p>
<p>****: Pull out all the wires.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded
cause you unplugged it–pull out all the wires.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Opening it without the code must have
triggered the timer…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Did you know?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I just saved our lives-</p>
<p>****: Did you know? 61.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Of course not!</p>
<p>****: Where the hell are you-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Fennel.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Max thinks the country’s lost it’s way, gone
soft in the War on Terror! This is his solution!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target, pin it
on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again! The same
people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into
a parking lot!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: What was the target?</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: The Mall of America! Christ!</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: I’m serious! It’s his sense of humor! He
told us we could choose between there and Epcot Center…</p>
<p>****: Holy shit, it’s like we were framed by Dr. No…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: What about Goliath?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yeah, what would an oil company want with
the Middle East?</p>
<p>****: The ships that service their offshore oil rigs are exempt from
US Customs! It’s how Max gets the drugs in and out of the country-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: This is conspiracy theory bullshit-</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: It’s not! There’s proof!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Max’s heroin operation - Goliath keeps
accounts of the shipments!</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Come on, dude, they’d be morons to keep
records of shit like this-</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: It’s on a stand-alone hard drive! It’s their
insurance policy against Max - they know he’s crazy, this way they have
something on him! 63.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So this hard drive - it contains evidence of
what Max has been doing?</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Can you get us this drive?</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: I don’t know where it is! They don’t let me
have access! But-</p>
<p><strong>fennel</strong>: No, wait! Please don’t kill-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I say we hit Goliath headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: And do what - go after this non- existent
hard drive?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We find out if it exists. If it does, we steal
it and trade it for immunity.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: That’s your plan?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You got a better one?</p>
<p>****: 64.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Max gives us back our lives or we upload the
data to the net, show the American people what’s being done in their
names.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Why risk our lives again when we already have
something to trade?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You want to give it back to him?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I want to at least discuss it before signing
up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s not happening.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: So you want to take down Goliath now? Then
who? McDonald’s? American Airlines? Microsoft?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You don’t want Max to pay?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I want my life back! This is supposed to be
us getting clear - not saving the world!</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: We’re not the goddamn good guys anymore! I
love you guys, but I had a life before this shit, and I sure as hell am
not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of
the Dudley Damn Do-Rights! 65.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Don’t raise your voice at me-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I will raise whatever the hell I want - you
got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I’m gonna cut your head off…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I say we hit Goliath. Jensen?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Goliath. Cougs?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Aisha?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: She doesn’t get a vote-</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Goliath.</p>
<p>****: Put it away…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You want your life back, you’re gonna have to
steal it. We hit them in two days.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Don’tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: So what do we do about the nuke?</p>
<p>****: Did I just actually say that?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I have an idea…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Holy- Sarge, come quick!</p>
<p><strong>match with:</strong>: 67.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: That’s gonna be a quick trial…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wonderful guy, salt of the earth, he’ll be
missed–who took my bomb, Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You’re not gonna like it…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Because I’ve been such a fan of how things have
gone up till now?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who the hell are these people?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Colonel Clay and his unit. You had them killed
three years ago?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I also had several African nations overthrown
three years ago, I’m a</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: The Jamal al-Fadhil situation?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man
fire team ready in twelve hours. 68.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: So what’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s the plan? The plan is - get me a six man
fire team ready in twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to
try a third go-around?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Because what I’m going to need you to do is get
me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. You get that, right?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I get it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And Wade?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re gonna need a new bomb.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: We appreciate you meeting us in a
single story facility.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p>****: 69.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I look at that entire incident as your
standard “getting to know” each other business orientation.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: I agree. Now that we know each
other, know, please, that if you come near me with any more of that
Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit, you will be fed to my dogs.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Fair enough, Doc. Can we now move past the
verbal aggression and get into some business?</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: You want another device. One
billion dollars is now the price. One billion dollars cash.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: That’s going to be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: Life the way you people want to
live it is very difficult, Mr. Wade. You want less difficult move to my
country, study Hinduism. Meditate. Cultivate serenity. Much less
difficult. You want to buy atomic bombs… I’m afraid that is a more
difficult way of life.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He wants one billion in cash.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s a lot of a paper routes…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Can we swing it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not even close.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: The Company?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Won’t give it to us willingly…</p>
<p>****: You get that six man team together like I asked?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Change of plans. Kill them.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Kill them?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Or fire them, whichever’s easier.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Honestly? Firing them.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fine, fine, I’m not a detail guy. What I need-
wait. Did you give them intel on Clay’s people?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Aaaand we’re back to killing them.</p>
<p>****: Fine, I’ll kill them - what are we doing instead? 71.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are you related to
them?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Actually, one of them, yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: By blood?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: A brother-in-law, I said I’d kill him, what
are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s not what we’re doing, it’s what Clay is
going to do for us…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: And that is?</p>
<p>****: Get us our billion dollars…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I was just going over the plan.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You want to go over the plan?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Let’s go over the plan…</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 72.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: So, what really happened to you in
Afghanistan?</p>
<p>****: That’s not for you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Why do you want Max dead?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: He’s a bad man. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: When you tell me about Afghanistan? I’ll tell
you about Max.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Fine. It’s hot. There’s lots of sand. Your
turn.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Why were you alone when I found you?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: The guys got sick of it.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Sick of what? 73.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Of hearing about Max. Of hearing me say we had
to do something when there wasn’t anything to do. They wanted to be
around their families. Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a wife and
daughters.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: And he hasn’t told them he is alive?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Would you? The people you loved the most,
would you put them in that kind of danger? Aisha, side-stepping the
question:</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: So Roque has no one.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: He’s got me.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: And you have…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Enough hate to get us both through the day. He
stuck with me when no one else would. And I ain’t the easiest guy to
stick with.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: If you two really fought, he would kill you,
I think.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You think.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I’m almost sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Why? 74.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Because you care what happens to the others.
You wouldn’t put them at risk to save yourself.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: And you think that’s a weakness.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I know it is. Law of the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We’re not in the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Oh, yes we are…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Well, that’s just great.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: We’re not going anywhere until you two squash
this shit.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Pooch, we’re on a schedule here-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sorry I hit you.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Good. Roque?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Roque? 75.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Sorry I threatened to cut your head off.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Verrrry good. Now don’t you two feel
better?</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I don’t give a shit, I do. Now, let’s go
watch Jensen single- handedly knock over the largest oil company on the
planet…</p>
<p>****: I got jungle fever, you’ve got jungle fever, we’ve got jungle
fever, we’re in love…</p>
<p>****: …she’s gone black-boy crazy, I’ve gone white-girl hazy, ain’t
no thinking maybe, we’re in love…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yo! Package for Henderson! 76.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Excuse me one moment-</p>
<p>****: I’ll take that, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: No can do, chica, gotta put it in his hands.
He’s gotta sign.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’m sorry–could you say that
again?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Babydoll, I’m on the clock here!</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Forty fifth floor.</p>
<p>****: I got jungle fever, you’ve got jungle fever, we’ve got jungle
fever, we’re in love…</p>
<p>****: Mr. Henderson, please.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Who’s calling, please?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Richard Hertz from Internal Security.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: One moment, please…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Ladies… hi.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Liking the angle of the dangle?</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: This is Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson, Richard Hertz
from Internal Security. If you’d be kind enough to make your way down to
the lobby?</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Uh… Can I ask what this is about?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: It’s a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature
involving an</p>
<p>****: 78.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: individual exposing himself to women in the
elevators–best discussed in person. If you’d just head on down…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Hi, I’m Skippy from tech support. Is
Henderson around? I’m supposed to install a firewall on his system-</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh, you just missed him by like two
seconds. Can you come back in like an hour or so?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs breathing down
my neck. They want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a
sudden.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Five minutes and I’ll be out of your
hair!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Security? 79.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: According to this, the drive exists,
Clay.</p>
<p><strong>intercut with the van</strong>: Clay shoots a look at
Roque.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Abso-tootly.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Is it in the building?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: No, somewhere off-site. It’s gotta be a
remote location, stand-alone. I’m checking their security logs– wherever
they’ve detailed the most guys is probably where it’ll be…</p>
<p><strong>security guard 1</strong>: “Skippy”?</p>
<p><strong>security guard 1</strong>: Show me some ID. Real easy.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Whoa! Take it easy. You’re the-</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Get me out of here, Clay… 80.</p>
<p>****: There’s a fire exit thirty yards north of your position.</p>
<p><strong>big security 1</strong>: Freeze like a statue, pretty
boy!</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I’m warning you, man, I’m a lethal weapon…
Jensen turns on the big fellah.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: It was this secret government project. They
did stuff to me. Spooky stuff. Anal stuff. Turned me into a dangerous
Telekinetic. As the old saying goes - you don’t start none… there won’t
be none.</p>
<p><strong>big security 1</strong>: Telekinetic your way out of
this…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Bang.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Boom.</p>
<p><strong>big security 2</strong>: You broke my ribs… 81.</p>
<p><strong>third guard</strong>: Please- d-don’t shoot…</p>
<p><strong>tight on jensen</strong>: Full Dirty Harry.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Face down, or I’ll make your hearts stop
beating with my mind.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Thanks, Coug…</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: De Nada.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: By your boys?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: They’re not “my boys”. I don’t like this. I
say we grab Clay and kill the rest.</p>
<p>****: If you can find them- 82.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I can.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Put a fire team together.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You’re sure? You’re not going to call me in
two hours and have me kill them? I’m on it…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Everything on Goliath - security, personnel
history, the works. Aisha’s brow furrows at this. Only we notice.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Where’s the drive being kept?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Port of New York, baby. Total stand alone
facility, and they’re spending 30K a day on onsite security - you don’t
drop that kinda green to just guard oil. 83.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What are we up against?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Let me check, I–oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What’s “oh, shit”?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: They’ve hired Par-Sec. A beat. This clearly
means something bad to all of them.</p>
<p>****: Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Who’s Par-Sec?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Paradigm Security Services. Ex- Special
Forces.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Basically guys like Cougar but without the
warm and cuddly side.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Goliath must have brought them in after we hit
their truck…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Our drive is being guarded by military
trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers… Am I the
only one who’s thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Comb that drive for every last scrap of info.
We’re on a plane for New York tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Oh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>int. warehouse - night</strong>: Jensen and Pooch sitting at
a table. Both with laptops. Jensen tapping his keys. Roque enters,
carrying a coffee. Stops short, seeing the others. Surprised.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Thought you guys’d be back at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from the machine
- you want one?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: You won’t believe how detailed these files
are. Every Goliath executive they’ve ever insured, their policies, their
payouts-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Life insurance?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: What’s the biggest payout? 85.</p>
<p>****: Gotta be wrongful death…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Pretty much what we’re gonna be risking.</p>
<p>****: What are you doing up?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch
shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED VIDEO from earlier in
the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a Playground - POOCH’S DAUGHTERS PLAYING.
They both watch for a bit. The only sound, Jensen’s typing. Then:</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: When we first went over in 2001, Jolene and
my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right? Only problem
was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been
cleaned out.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Military neighborhood…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: No doubt. And Tina’s four at the time, and
what she can’t understand is why the ribbon’s gotta be yellow. So Jolene
sings her the song, right? To show her where the idea comes from. And
when she’s all done, Tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye
and says “that’s the dumbest song I ever heard.”</p>
<p>****: So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple
ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home… 86.</p>
<p>****: Thought that counts, right?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Jolene dated a guy last summer. Didn’t turn
into anything and I sure as hell can’t blame her, but that man was in my
house, Roque. I know you’re not a hundred percent on this op, but if it
can get me back to them…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I hear you, man.</p>
<p>****: Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath exec ever - 14 million and it
was wrongful death - Vice President of Operations in Afghanistan, three
years ago, paid to his daughter…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: We’re going to need to drive fast…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You really want to know about Afghanistan?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: You think she’s gonna kill him?</p>
<p><strong>pooch and roque</strong>: Uh-uh. No way.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yeah, I think so too…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: And this man you found in the basement - he
was your true target?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Max’s true target. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: And you spoke with him?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: He knew we were off mission. He knew Max
wanted him dead…</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Did he beg?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: The man in the basement. Did he beg for his
life?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: He begged to die–why are you asking me
this?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Freeze! 88.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: She’s his daughter, Clay! The guy in the
basement’s daughter and she’s got a gun and it’s pointed… …at my dick!
Her gun is pointed at my dick!</p>
<p>****: Would you rather I pointed it at your head?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I know it makes no sense, but actually
yes.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Shit, she’s got back-up!</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Go, go, go!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Think that got her?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: She ain’t that lucky. Jensen, status!</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: My dick remains unshot!</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Here they come…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Somebody shoot something!</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I think Cougar’s got a plan! Coug, do you
have a plan? He’s got a plan!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Stop yelling at the sniper! THROUGH THE SCOPE
– Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the chopper on the left… Smiles,
PRESSES THE TRIGGER…</p>
<p><strong>ext. lear jet 550 – day</strong>: Coming in for LANDING…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: They got away.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So?</p>
<p>****: 91.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We know exactly where they’re going, Wade. Port
of New York, for their big final awesome stand against the forces of
evil where they die.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: Do you have the money?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jesus, always with the money! So impersonal!
How are you? How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: I recently attended the funeral of
my best friend who you had thrown out a window. How have you been?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Can’t complain. I’m thinking of getting
satellite radio in my car…</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: I think you’re a freak. Too much
Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy football.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, I’m all about the bombs, baby.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: We have your ordinance. You have
twenty four hours to get the money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Time to go make a withdrawal… 92.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: New change of plan. You stay.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ve got to go get your money.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: He’ll get your money. You stay
right here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: God, are you short.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: Twenty three hours, fifty nine
minutes…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get it done.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How much do you weigh? Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: I do not think you are funny.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where the hell is my bomb?</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: You do not get it till I get the
money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: For a guy who’s all about transcending
materialism, you talk about money so much! 93.</p>
<p><strong>short scientist</strong>: If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will
cut your mouth out of your face.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: She burned us, Clay.</p>
<p>****: I know…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: The whole op is compromised-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood flowing out
of his body…</p>
<p>****: Precious, precious blood…</p>
<p>****: Cougar? Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a
WOODEN DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: So we split up again. Right?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Right? 94.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Pooch…</p>
<p>****: Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows, Max knows! It’s over!</p>
<p>****: Okay. We split up. Some of us should go international. I’ll do
that if nobody else wants to-</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: So we just run again?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: There’s nothing else we can do…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: There’s something we can do.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Three years is enough. If there’s a drive at
that port that we can use to get clear-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What part of “he knows we’re coming for it” do
you not get? They’re gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec is gonna waiting
for us… 95.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: So figure out a way around them; you’re good
at that shit, Clay!</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: We run now, we’re gonna be running forever.
This is our one chance to get our lives back…</p>
<p>****: To steal them back. And I’m prepared to do anything to any one
to make that happen.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Never play a longshot, you’re never gonna
win.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Pooch, what’s the minimum time to scout the
patrols, get an accurate head count on-site at the Port?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: 48 hours, but Aisha knows that-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So we hit them in twelve.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Twelve hours from now? You mean– you want us
to go in blind?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Last thing they’ll expect…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Yeah, cause it’s dumb.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Jensen’s already got the layout, and Cougar
can spot on site. Right?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Jensen?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yeah, cause gettin’ shot is awesome, I’m
totally up for doing it again…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Pooch?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Last time we went in blind on an op, we lost
everything…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: So let’s go get it back.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Roque? 97.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p>****: We’re in. Status.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: The Pooch is good.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Cougar, squelch if you’re in position.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Squelch.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Jensen, we’re coming. You ready? 98.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: And the crowd goes wild…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: What’s the password?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Open the door before we kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Drive should be in the Computer Room, two
skylights over.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Roque and I will set the charges here but we
won’t detonate until you have the drive.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You can’t settle for stealing the drive, you
gotta blow up Goliath’s shit too.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What can I say, I hold a grudge.</p>
<p>****: Get gone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Be ready to move the second Cougar hits the
fire alarm… 99.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Guys, we got a problem…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Wade’s here.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: No. I say we roll.</p>
<p><strong>ext. goliath rooftops</strong>: Jensen, by a MIRRORED
SKYLIGHT . Attaching a HARNESS to his waist…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I’m above the computer room, maybe thirty
seconds from the drive…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Wade’s headed your way - last chance to get
the duck out of Fodge… 100.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Something’s not right. Something…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Clay.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I think you should see this. Roque’s got the
doors of the container opened that he’s looking in. Clay approaches…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You think… Aisha?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: No. Not Aisha.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You know, for a revenge driven conspiracy
nut, you’re pretty fucking gullible…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Jensen, you get it? Jensen?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Hello, Clay. Been awhile.</p>
<p>****: Roque.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: When…?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: After the truck. I got tired of waiting for
you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and
cut a deal - I set this up, I go free.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Traitor… 102.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You gave me no choice. It was always gonna
end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You
made sure of it.</p>
<p>****: Bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Not bullshit. You were gonna keep planning
missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this
situation is at least I get to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We all could have walked… used the drive…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Don’t you get it yet? There is no drive.
There never was…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Fennel made it up to save himself. When I
told Wade, he planted the info at Goliath to lead you here.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You really thought there was a happy ending
coming? Pooch was gonna get his family back, we were gonna get to be
soldiers again? We lost the moment we went off mission. This is just the
logical conclusion of that playing out. You didn’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>****: 103.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You just wanted your revenge. Your
face-to-face with the big bad wolf. I’m sorry, buddy, but it’s the way
of the world…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Guys like us don’t beat guys like him.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Kill me now… Maybe you live through this.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Oh, we’re not gonna kill you. Someone’s gotta
get away with the cash. Your crew? I’m definitely wasting them. But
you?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You’re about to steal a billion dollars from
the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’s for our replacement nuke. When a billion
goes missing, people tend to ask who took it.</p>
<p>****: Max really does love to frame you…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Take him away. Drop him in Newark.</p>
<p>****: I’ll see you at Turner Airfield. 104.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I’m sorry it had to end this way.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re going to die very badly. The guards
hustle Clay out the door…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Roque.</p>
<p><strong>lead guard</strong>: On your knees.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Get on with it… 105.</p>
<p><strong>lead guard</strong>: That’s a nice hat.</p>
<p><strong>lead guard</strong>: Don’t really care of there’s a hole in
it. One wash, good as…</p>
<p>****: What are you smiling at?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Shouldn’t have gone after the hat… 106.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Can you stand?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I’ve been shot in both legs, what kind of
dumbass question is that?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Oh, so we’re Mr. Grumpy now? You’re not the
only one who’s been shot recently, you know!</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Did you kill my father? Jensen comes running
up, interrupting:</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Clay?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Kind of in the middle of something here,
Jensen-</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: There was no drive, Clay- 107.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: There was no drive and Roque’s gone and
Par-Sec’s regrouping and Pooch could bleed out-</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: He asked us. It was mercy. But you’re his
family, so I understand.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: But only me.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: Wear it. Remember him. 108.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Okay, excellent, very tribal–We need to
go.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Can you stand?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: This is stupid question day, isn’t it? It’s
stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: They won. We lost. Way it goes.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Way it always goes.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Guess we should just head home. Oh, wait,
that’s right. We don’t have homes.</p>
<p><strong>cougar</strong>: Where to, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should we be
worried?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Clay doesn’t take risks. It’s why I’m here
and he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Can I ask you something? Why’d you stick with
those losers for so long?</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: They were good guys.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: No such thing. I’ll go call Max.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Hi, Wade!</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Declan, start the plane…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Next time, remind me - car crash first, then
get shot…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Sounds less painful that way…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Cougar and I are going after that plane. The
rest of you, get Wade.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Me and legless Pooch are on it!</p>
<p>****: Where the hell is she going? Aisha is heading off to the
fenceline… Clay and Cougar run for Wade’s CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind
the wheel and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: You call me legless Pooch again, you’re gonna
be Headless Jensen.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: What, it’s a cool name! It makes you sound
like a pirate! Fine, let’s go kill Wade…</p>
<p><strong>on the runway</strong>: 111.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We don’t have enough runway to take off -
we’re going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed!</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Fine, just get us in the air! He fires
ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette! CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: I’m out!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Get me closer…</p>
<p><strong>int. hangar – night</strong>: Jensen enters, carrying a
MACHINE GUN.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Yoo-hoo! Wade! Come out and plaaaayyy-</p>
<p>****: Hey, Wade’s coming at you! I…</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: I think I just found our way out of
here…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Gotta admit, I always wondered how this would
play out.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Aisha thinks you kill me.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: It’s a distinct possibility…</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: You don’t have a knife?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Don’t need one.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Bit of as longshot for you…</p>
<p>****: No. It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>roque</strong>: Now I really am gonna cut your head off…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Rifle…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>jensen</strong>: Not to rain on everyone’s we killed all the
bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a
Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar. It’s a cool name-</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We good?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Not by a longshot. You’re not having a real
great day, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Just a voice on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where’s Wade?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Working on the engines. 116.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Clay.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Colonel, yes. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I understand you’ve always wanted to meet face
to face. I’m sure that could be arranged…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t think the guys you’re about to stiff
for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen. We win. You
lose. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Lear jet?</p>
<p>****: Ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I wanted to find and punish those responsible
for my father’s death. Max, his men, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: That why you slept with me? 117.</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: That and the cardio.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>aisha</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Good cause there’s no way I could walk it… She
helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they head for the
Hangar. Together.</p>
<p><strong>short scientest</strong>: Time is up, Stretch.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stretch. That’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>short scientest</strong>: Because you are so much taller than
I.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, no, I get it…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You gentlemen consider yourselves to be
soldiers or businessmen?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 118.</p>
