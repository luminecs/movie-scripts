<p><strong>radio newscaster</strong>: …and I’m Ed Harris with the KLTZ
Early Morning Report.</p>
<p><strong>radio newscaster</strong>: Crystal Lake in Pinehurst County,
the scene of several unsolved deaths years ago, is tragically back in
the top of the news this morning. Police have uncovered the remains of
eight, as yet, unidentified persons in a gruesome and baffling story of
mass murder…</p>
<p><strong>radio newscaster</strong>: …Judging from the sheer brutality
of the murders, police theorize that they must have been committed by at
least four persons…</p>
<p><strong>radio newscaster</strong>: …The sole survivor of the massacre
has been taken under heavy sedation to County Hospital in Linfield for
observation. She’s been unable to provide police with any clues and is
being kept under round the clock guard…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Goddamnit Harold! I spent all day yesterday
washing your clothes and look what you’re doing to ’em. Shows how much
you care about me.</p>
<p><strong>television reporter</strong>: …A police spokesman tells
Eyewitness News that authorities have been combing the area since just
before dawn. Reports of cannibalism and sexual mutilation are still
unconfirmed… Nevertheless, these murders are already being called the
most brutal in local history.</p>
<p><strong>television reporter</strong>: The motive behind the grisly
murders remains a mystery at this hour as does the identity of the
killer or killers. The search continues for more bodies.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: My God, My God, My God.</p>
<p><strong>television reporter</strong>: …Residents of the Lake region
are being urged to take extra precaution when approaching strangers and
to report anything unusual to police, immediately. We’ll be back with
the weather forecast after this important message.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold, what’re you doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold… I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: God Damn pest, what are you staring at?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Christ All Mighty, Harold, you just take
what’s yours and leave the rest for me to do. Very considerate! You
could at least finished the job. Do I have to do everything around
here?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold… I swear, sometimes you’re such a
child…</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Sorry guys, it’s back to the slammer before
Edna make a fur coat out of ya.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Didn’t I feed you enough for breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: The doctor said you had to lose weight, didn’t
he? I try to help you but you sneak food behind my back. What am I gonna
do with you?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: And put those filthy animals back where they
belong, please!</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: What’re you little guys so nervous
about?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Who would do this…?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: What happened? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: It’s all the crap you’ve been stuffing
yourself with.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Now where could that other needle have
gone?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Those poor little creatures…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold… what’s taking you so long in there?
You all right?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Whiskey, I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Harold!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s the last house on the left. She lives
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey Shelly! Come on out and meet your
date.</p>
<p><strong>shelly’s voice</strong>: Bring her to me!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What’re you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How about you two? You coming?</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sex, sex, sex. You guys are getting boring,
you know that?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So what would a weekend in the country be
without sex?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Cool it, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I didn’t mean it the way it sounded…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I know you didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look guys, I don’t want to ruin your weekend.
What happened to me at the cottage happened a long time ago and I think
I’ve worked that out. I’m all right now.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I appreciate the fact that you worry about
me, but don’t.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Okay, we won’t. We’ll just have fun, all
agreed?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Aaahhh!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dammit Shelly! Why do you always have to be
such an asshole!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I beg your pardon, I’m not an asshole. I’m
an actor.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Same thing.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Look Shelly, you’re my roommate and I like
you… most of the time. But you gotta stop doing these things. Now, I set
this date up for you, didn’t I? So don’t embarrass me. When you meet
this woman, just relax and be yourself.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Would you be yourself… …if you looked this
this?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Sanchez. I’m Chris. We’ve come to
pick up Vera.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: She’s not going.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I don’t know. I flunked Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Hi everybody, what’re you looking at. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You know, just your basic old fashioned mother
problems. So, where’s my date?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You’re Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hey! The van’s on fire!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How much farther to the cottage?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We could’ve been there already… …if some
people didn’t have to go to the bathroom every five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Oh yeah…well just hope that you never get
pregnant, ’cause all you do all the time is piss!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Is that all you two are gonna do this
weekend…smoke dope?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Why not, man? Is there a law against it?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: There’s better things to do with your
life.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: I can’t think of anything.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Sure, why not.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Is this stuff any good?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Home grown, man! Of course it’s good!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: And it’s good for you, too. Strictly organic.
No preservatives, man.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, let’s share the wealth with those less
fortunate up front here.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: What d’ya got in there?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: My whole world.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: In that little thing?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Stick around and you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Better hide that grass. It’s the cops.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Destroy the evidence, Pronto!</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Destroy the evidence? No, man!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Yes, man!</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Come on, dig in!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Aw shit!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Here…eat.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Try me some other time. I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: No way. We’re pregnant. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: You better step on it!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Faster! Eat faster!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Why don’t you help us?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uh… I guess I’m just not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re always hungry!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They’re too close. I gotta pull the van over.
Hurry up and swallow! Everybody just be cool.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I think I’m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: The line forms at the rear.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I’m gonna be sicker than all of you, man. Now
I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight… I don’t think I can
make it, man!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Chuck… look.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Not now, man!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: I’m a slow eater.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I love you, man!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hey, kiddo… don’t let your imagination run
away with you.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Would you look at that! I’ve never seen a
senior citizen hitchhiker before.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Let’s give the poor old guy a break. Pick ’im
up.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That scarecrow? Can’t you tell how weird his
is just by looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Come on, Shelly. Who else is gonna give him a
lift?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Not us! He’s really creepy.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: He looks just like my grandfather, man. Let’s
give him a ride.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: You are, all of you, very kind and generous
young people to lend a helping hand to a tired, old man. Thank you very
much. Perhaps I can repay the kindness.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: My name is Abel. And I am my brother’s
keeper.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Going? How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I mean, is there any place in particular
where we can drop you off?</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Drop me off? How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Look what His Grace has brought me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: I found this today. There were other pieces of
the body lying there, but I believe “he” wanted me to have this…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s an eyeball! Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: “He” wanted me to warn you. Look at this, all
of you!</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: See with your own eyes what I have seen.
Runaway! Go back to where you came from… Now!!!</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: I warned you!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Some people stretch their legs…. Some their
arms…. And some nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How come there’s never a cop around when you
really need one.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Wake up, everybody. Revenge is ours.
Look!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Let’s bring in the luggage first, then I’ll
give you a tour of the house and the barn and then we can hang out at
the lake… All right?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Come on down!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m gonna take my bags into the house first
and look around.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Derek… stop.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You know what I’ve been through. Don’t ever
scare me like that.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m sorry. I just wanted to surprise you.
What can I say?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You can say… “Hello, how are you?”… for
starters.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hello. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You haven’t changed a bit. Always so sure of
yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing
could stop you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Is that so bad?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re irresistible. I lose control.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Just slow down. Let me get to know you again.
Let me get to know this place again.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Okay. There’s a whole weekend ahead of us.
There’s time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come outside and help me with the bags.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’ll get the bags off the top. You get the
ones inside.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This door was open just a minute ago, wasn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s my bag. I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’re you doing in there? Why aren’t you
down at the lake with the others.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: ’Cause they’re skinny-dipping and I’m not
skinny enough.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: It’s dark down there.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: That’s the way it is, man. Cellars are
dark.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: And Hell is hot, but I ain’t goin’ down there
either.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: There’s nothin’ to be afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Gimme your threads, man.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: You broke the electricity, man!</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Who’s there?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Whatever happened to equal rights for men?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Stop bitching. You can’t expect me to carry
heavy things in my condition.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: This was my bedroom. It’s yours for the
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Uh, Chris… I don’t mean to be picky, but…
where do we sleep?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Your bed.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: A hammock?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Have you ever made love in a hammock?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hmmm… why not?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Where’s the bed?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Derek, come in here!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Look what I found. Remember these?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Did you stay here last night?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No. I got here just before you did.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Somebody was in here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Goldilocks and the Three Bears?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m serious. Doesn’t this look a little
strange to you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t get paranoid. I’m sure your parents
left it this way last time they were here. You know how messy your
father is. If there was a phone here, I’d call them up right now.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You have an answer for everything, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I just think that it’s about time you stopped
looking over your shoulder, always expecting there’s someone coming
after you. That’s no way to live.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No more… I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes, you can. Come on, Shelly!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: If you’ll all please excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How could you let her beat you?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Where’s Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I haven’t seen him.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come on!…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Shelly! Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Are you all right, Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Let’s spread out and check all the rooms.
Outside, too. You stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No. I can look around by myself. I’ll take
the upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Shelly…?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He’s dead… he’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t look! Let’s just get the hell out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Don’t touch him!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Get up, you creep.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I guess I fooled you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why you little bastard! I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Leave him alone. He doesn’t know any
better.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It was a joke… just a joke… I didn’t mean
to…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You never mean to.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I gotta get out of here. I’ll go get some more
booze.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Here, take my VW.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Let me go with you! I gotta get away from
here, too.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: That’ll be $23.50… and we don’t accept no
food stamps.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Shelly… I need some money. Throw me your
wallet.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Is… is everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Everything’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Excuse me, but I believe that’s mine…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Make a wish.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uh… could I buy you two a beet or
something?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I’ll take that, now.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: “A True Trojan… thin as a shadow, strong as a
horse.”</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: That’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Didn’t your mama teach you manners? If you want
somethin’, you ask nice!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Please… be cool.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: May be please have the wallet.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You mean, “May we please have the wallet…
ma’am.”</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: May we please have the wallet… …. ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That’s good. That’s real nice.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Are they following us?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Gulp!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Aw, shit!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: See anything?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Just a dirty window. Next time, I’ll know
how to handle a situation like that. Let’s just hope that “next time”
isn’t too soon.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Stop worrying. I don’t think they’ll bother to
come after us.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: So, I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Not this time, old man.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Where the hell are they? I don’t see them
anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Holy shit!!!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Got any good ideas?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: This is no time to celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Just keep your eyes on the road.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell
“stop,” you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You’re the boss.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Bullseye!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Stop the car! Now!!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet
weekend in the country.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Look at it this way… things can only get
better… Right?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Maybe we should do some exercise.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: This is all the exercise I need…</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Where’s your windshield, man?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What happened to you guys? Are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The question is… is the beer all right?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: We had a slight misunderstanding with that
motorcycle gang… … but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: My beautiful car! What’d you do to it?!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: We’re really sorry, but it wasn’t our
fault.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: A few minor repairs and it’ll be as good as
new.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: This is too painful to look at.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why don’t we drive over to the cove and watch
the sunset. It’ll mellow you out.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Might be nice to get away from these crazy
friends of yours.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Why don’t we go take a swim?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: We’d be all alone. We could do anything we
wanted and nobody would see.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sounds disgusting. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You go ahead. I’m gonna get a blanket.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Maybe we shouldn’t do this, Ali.</p>
<p><strong>loco</strong>: We gotta even the score, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Nobody’s gonna get hurt, baby.</p>
<p><strong>loco</strong>: Let me do it.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Whoaaa….!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Quiet, woman! Get off that thing!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: But it feels so goooooood…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You’re getting me pissed-off, Fox. We got work
to do.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Go get her out of there.</p>
<p><strong>loco</strong>: Fox… where are ya!?</p>
<p><strong>loco</strong>: Stop foolin’ around. You’re screwin’ up
everything.</p>
<p><strong>loco</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>loco</strong>: You’ve had it now, woman! I’m mad!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Loco… Fox… Open this damn door.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What the hell are you two doin’ up there?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We haven’t looked in the barn, yet. Let’s take
a look.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Not now. I’m cold.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How about a roll in the hay?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You can play with yourself, ’cause I’m going
in the house.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Can’t stop now.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Ninety six… ninety seven… ninety eight… ninety
nine… one hundred…</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: One hundred… ninety nine… ninety eight…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Who brought up this bright idea?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: We were looking for something to keep our
hands busy. It was either this or an orgy. Vera chose this. What’re ya
gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: How about you and I whacking a couple of
balls around?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If you insist.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Is that better?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You know, I’m not sure I could live anywhere
else. The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s deceiving.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The quiet can fool you. It fooled me. You can
never be sure of what’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Why did you come back here?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: … To prove something to myself… to prove I’m
stronger than I think I am.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: And, what about us?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m here with you. Can’t that be enough for
now?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t see you for months on
end, and when I do, you put this wall between us. How do I break
through?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m trying. I’m really trying.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What happened that night?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You promised you’d never ask me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: After you left me that night, I didn’t see
you or talk to you again for a year. No one would tell me anything. All
I know is what the police told me. We have nowhere to go unless you let
me in. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: … One thousand twelve… one thousand thirteen…
one thousand fourteen… What’s the World’s Record for this?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: According to the Guinness Book, you passed
the World’s Record several whacks ago.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I did?! I broke the world’s record.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Who cares, man?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re all just jealous.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Actually, I have no idea what the World’s
Record is. I was just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Think you’re funny? Well, I’ll just have to
start all over again.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, what do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Come on, Champ, I think you and I can find
something to do.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Remember that strange looking plant we saw
outside. Let’s go smoke it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I guess that leaves you and me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vera… you and I have had a chance to really
get to know one another today. I like you… very much. I was thinking
that maybe.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Don’t say any more.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I’m going outside for a few minutes. We’ll
talk when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How do we do it?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: First we take off our clothes, then you get
on top of me or I get on top of you…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I know how to do it. I mean, how do we do it
in the hammock?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Think you can figure it out?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I had never made love to anybody before that
night. You made it so special, I hope it would always be like that for
us.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: When you dropped me off at the house, it was
very late. My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the
door, they starting yelling and cursing at me. I was so upset… I told
them I slept with you. My mothers slapped me. That was the first time
she’d ever hit me. I couldn’t believe it. I ran out of the house and
into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying. They had
destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish
them for that. I decided to hide out all night. They’d be so worried
that they’d be sorry for what they did to me. The woods were cold and
damp from the rain. I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I
guess I fell asleep. All I can remember next is being startled out of
sleep by the sound of footsteps. I thought it was my father so I hid
behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark. I
couldn’t see anything. I heard a cracking noise behind me. I turned
around and… and… oh, God… there was this hideous looking man. So
grotesque he was almost inhuman. He had a knife and he started to slash
away at me, again and again. I was so hysterical and I don’t know how I
was able to get away. I ran and ran, but he kept coming. He was big but
so fast. He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he… he…
ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me? Then… oh,
God… he dragged me by the hair along the ground. I was kicking and
yelling. He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods. Oh, please…
please…</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s all right, you’re all right. I’m with
you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I… I don’t know what happened after that. I
must have fainted because the next thing I knew I would talk about it.
And I never have. Not until now. I just wanted to forget. But I can’t.
I’ll never forget that horrible face. Never.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s the battery, damnit.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s no problem. We’ll just walk back.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You’ve just learned a valuable lesson. A
beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Damn you, Shelly!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Why do you do these stupid things?!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You don’t “have to.”</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I just want you to like me.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I do like you. But not when you act like a
jerk.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Being a jerk is better than being
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I never said you were “nothing”.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You don’t to say it. I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Hey… I’ll be in, in a little while. We can
talk some more.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Chuck? Chili? What’re you guys doing in
there?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You guys doin’ somethin’ I shouldn’t
see?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: That’s just great!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Hey… I dropped your wallet! I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I found it!</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: What’re you doing? Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: That was the best yet. Was it you… me… or
the hammock?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I vote for me.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I vote for the hammock.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m seasick. Get in or get out of the
boat.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I think it’s called “a shower”. You might
try it sometime.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re too clean for me.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey Deb… can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Barely.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m going downstairs to get a beer. You want
one?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you want a beer or not?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Andy… Are you still out there?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Andy? You can have my beer. I don’t want
it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Andy, don’t bring me a beer. Do you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Andy! Answer me! I hate when you do
that.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Blood…?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Could we move a little faster?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Sure, just watch where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’re you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: I’m one of the Flock as are you my Brother and
Sister.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yeah… sure… I think we should be going.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: I can’t let you go.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Look old man, we don’t want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Then turn around and walk away from
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come on, Chris…</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: I have done by best. I can do no more.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: I can’t find the bong anywhere. Can’t you
remember where you dropped it?</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: I can’t even remember what day it is,
man.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: It’s Friday the 13th.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: What’s the matter?!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Nothin’. I was just foolin’ around.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Don’t do that to me!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Here. Go down the cellar and check the
fusebox.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Be a man, man.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: There’s nothin’ to be scared of, man. Just go
over to the fusebox and check it out. You can do that. Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Whew… that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: What’s goin’ on, Chuck?!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: What’s goin’ on around here? Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Get up, Shelly. Stop foolin’ around.</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: What’re you doin’ down there, man?</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Chuck?</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Oh, my God… Help!!!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Andy! Debbie! Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Vera! Chris! Where is everybody?!!?</p>
<p><strong>chili</strong>: Oh please, is anybody here?!</p>
