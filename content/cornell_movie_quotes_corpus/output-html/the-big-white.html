<p><strong>corporal</strong>: So his hand is like, off, right. So he
puts on a tourniquet, puts the hand in his pocket, walks five miles
through the bush til he gets to the highway, where he passes out, on the
road, right. Then this logging truck comes along…</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>car’s pov</strong>: Through the windshield of a WOMAN ,
dressed in her pajamas and a parka, skipping down the middle of the
road.</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Dispatch, this is unit 611, we need a
first responsder –</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Cancel that.</p>
<p><strong>hair stylist</strong>: She says “I haven’t eaten all day,”
then, right there on the bus she pulls out this, like, salmon steak and
I’m…</p>
<p><strong>men’s voices</strong>: One, two, three… up.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: We’ll get him later. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: “…Get up, everybody’s gonna move their
feet, get down, everybody’s gonna leave their seat…gonna lose your mind
in…”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Need a hand?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yeah. Could ya grab me those two by
eights?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No. Name’s Ted.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Hey Ted, I’m Howard.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey Howard. What is that, an Arctic Cat? What
do those go for?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: More than I could normally afford, I’ll tell
ya. Hey! What do you think you’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Howard, you seem like a reasonable kind of guy.
Lets you and me talk.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: WATTERS at his nearby cubicle, typing
frenetically on his computer.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: That was really cool. It was like… watching
“Cops”.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He was pretty spry for a man with a herniated
disc.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: You know, I don’t want to bitch or anything,
but you were supposed to take me along on that one.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Couldn’t find you.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: I know you know this, but the sooner they think
I can handle calls on my own, the sooner they’ll kick you back down
south.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ve been hearing that for 13 months and six
days, Cam. After a while, it gets a little old. Next time, okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s… quite the fish.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Paul Barnell, Ted Watters.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Raymond, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, Raymond. You see, as I’ve already
explained to Mr. Branch, he’s been gone for five years now, and I
thought it might be time to… move on.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: By move on you mean…?</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: …cash in Raymond’s policy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just thought, well, it’s pretty unlikely
he’s still alive. My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after each
other if anything should ever happen. And to be frank, money’s a little
–</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I understand Mr. Barnell, but here’s the thing.
With no actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must be missing for
seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead and that’s not
withstanding an investigation period where concerned parties can take up
to another year to file interventions concerning the motion. So, even
though your brother’s status is undetermined at this point, there’s
really very little we can do for you.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Of course we are extremely sorry for your
loss.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hang on, hang on. First off, how did you get
my cell number? Because it’s for mechanical and medical emergencies
only.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, and that check went out a week ago. I
watched my secretary write it up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well I don’t know. I, I, I have no clue. Could
it possibly be a problem on your end? So the electric company never
makes a… Look, I pay my bills. I’m a Rotarian for goodness –</p>
<p><strong>paul’s pov</strong>: of THE BODY– a 40-ish White male dressed
in a cheap suit. Paul’s phone lies across the corpse’s mouth, like the
dead guy is talking.</p>
<p><strong>the cell phone</strong>: Mr. Barnell? Mr. Barnell?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jodie, no! Not for dogs!</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: A COMPUTER SCREEN where swirling signs of
the Zodiac act as a screen saver. PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are –</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Psychic Pals. How are you today…
Mr. Williams? Well, we are all registered psychics here. I just had a
feeling you’d be calling. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey Tiff.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Your TV remote control? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: “If you like frozen enchiladas, getting caught
in the rain. If you’re not into…something brownish.”</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: It’s stew. I’m not sure it’s still
good.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Aren’t you with a customer?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: They’re concentrating.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So? How’s the tea leaf business today?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I’ve decided from now on to ignore you when
you’re ignorant about my work. And it’s going very well thank you.
Mr. Williams, I’m seeing sofa cushions. Do you have a sofa? Good. Glad I
could help.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You here from that software distributor
guy?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: No, but I did crack that code problem. You
know how sometimes when you’re running Beta versions you –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: English, please.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: There was a boo-boo, but I fixed it.
Psychic Pals, how are you today, Carol? Now I thought we’d agreed God is
everywhere, but not specifically in your coffee pot.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Jeez, Tiff.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Jeez, Ted. Do I tell you how to do your
job?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, but then again I’m not a computer aided
pseudo psychic, so if you’re looking for moral equivalence…</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Before you say anything else that may keep
us from having sex ever again, let me ask you something…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Tiff, please. I always get these wrong.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: That’s why we keep trying. Now, Love is
Sacrifice test. If you were in a life raft with me and there was only
enough water –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t you have a customer?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Carol? God says he’s busy with a famine
right now, but you should keep praying. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No. I’m not doing it.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: It’s just a stupid quiz.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Psychic Pals. Is this the first time you’ve
called us Mrs…?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Our only relationship problem is you’re running
a $1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Don’t call it a scam. Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: You’ve got to learn to channel that rage,
Margaret. You didn’t just call this your living room, did you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I meant ours. Ours, ours, ours.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I feel someone you really care about, maybe
even the love of your life, is being a real pain. Now I need you to
concentrate…</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Morning Mr. Barnell. Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thanks Avis. Looks good.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Well if we didn’t have the weather what would
we talk about? Did you send the computer back?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, it was not working. Any calls?</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Just that fellow from Municipal Power and
Electric. I told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some people
don’t like to listen.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Something… strange happened last night
Avis.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did… you ever meet my brother Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: The one who went missing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Uh huh. Well anyway last night there’s a knock
on the door and there’s Raymond, just… standing there on the
doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Didn’t you have him declared…?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dead? No. I mean, they said he hadn’t been
gone long enough.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Good thing in hindsight.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Lower 48. Said he wanted to get away from the
cold.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Where ’bouts?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sorry, what was that?</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Where was he living?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Florida.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: I’ve got an aunt down there. Where ’bouts?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A uh… small place. By the beach.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Well that’s great. You and Mrs. Barnell will
have some company for a bit I guess. How is she?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Better, a little better. Some days are better
than others.</p>
<p><strong>paperboy</strong>: Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker. I’ll
get my purse.</p>
<p><strong>paperboy</strong>: It’s 12 dollars. I missed you last
time.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Jerk off… OK, jerk off, uhhuh…</p>
<p><strong>paperboy</strong>: Sure will. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I thought stuff didn’t smell when it was
frozen? I don’t know why we have to–</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Dave wants visual confirmation, he gets
visual confirmation. We have a chance to move up here, so let’s
just–</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Like the guy’s not gonna end up in a land-
fill, anyway. You ever ask Dave what he did?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Whatever it was, he told him if he did it
again, he’d snap his neck.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Whoops, he did it again. The song? From that
girl?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Don’t even joke. Maybe the trash was
emptied.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Looks pretty full. Hey… There’s a little
fridge down here. If we would have shot him at least we’d know for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: I was following orders. And if you hadn’t
started a screaming match, no one would have called the cops and we
wouldn’t have had to dump his –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Fine. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I’m just saying… maybe you didn’t break it all
the way.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: It was broken.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I’m just saying… maybe it was like hypothermia
and he just looked dead.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: It - was - BROKEN!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul? Why is the fridge in the garage
chained shut?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How’s my Angel tonight?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Blow me. Dinner’s almost ready. You feel
like some wine? I feel like some wine.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sweetie, here’s a crazy thought… I don’t feel
like chicken tonight, why don’t we order in?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Fuck it, okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There’s actually something we need to talk
about. It’s about Raymond. He’s back.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Okay, I never thought it would last this
long, but seeing as how it has… There ya go. Let me just say that my
brother, old “Puddles McBarnesy” did better than he should have.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’cha saying there Raymond? Wha’cha saying
’bout me?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Enough, OK?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ray’s a little jeallllllllous. This is the one
that got away, right Ray?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Leave him alone, ball licker!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: And shut that thing –</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That’s okay, don’t worry about it. I’d
like the next one in a cup, please.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Raymond… Barnell.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Which one’s your sister’s kid?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: See the one on the little bike-thing? Him.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: You been alright with this?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: The thing with the guy? Ya know, I thought it
might kinda mess me up…</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: First time for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: …but I’ve been sleeping really well.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Yeah. ’Course, you didn’t actually…</p>
<p><strong>nephew</strong>: Leggo… it’s mine. Uncle Gary!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Wait a minute. He’s disappeared?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You just… hang in there, Billy!</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Yeah. But he’s dead. I mean, that part, no
question.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Yeah? Take off your coat. And your shirt,
too.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: I’m not wearing a wire, Dave, if that’s what
this is about.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: It was our first time. No one gets it perfect
their first time.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You too, Sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Excuse me for a second.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Gary! We’re in the middle of something.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey, I’m supposed to be looking after him.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Is he…?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: He’s fine. Look, we can take you there right
now. We’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Show me what? An empty trash dumpster? It was
supposed to look like an accident. I was hoping to see it in the paper.
So help me, if this guy pops up somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Fag! Big homo!</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: He won’t. He can’t. He’s –</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Proof, Jimbo. I like to know my money’s well
spent. You got a week.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Slippery little sucker. You mind if we stop at
a toy store on the way back?</p>
<p><strong>high angle on</strong>: Paul and Margaret in bed. Margaret
takes up more than her share of the bed, her arm tossed over her
husband. Paul, on his third of the bed, looks as if he’s lying in state.
But Paul’s not sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s see if anyone’s missing you.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He’s not here, is he?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sweetie, don’t you worry about Raymond.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: When he’s around, it just brings back…
Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know. He, he said he’s probably gonna head
back down South soon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: Paul? Thank you so much for clearing
the drive way. That was most considerate.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m afraid I don’t understand Mrs. Wherry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: You were out at the cabin this morning.
Nice to see you getting some use out of that thing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh I see. No, you see that must have been
Raymond. Very much so. No, no one was more surprised than we were. No,
he’s… indisposed right now, but I’m sure you’ll see him again. He’s
going to stay at the cabin for a while until he… leaves. And bless you
too.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “…It was my own lovely lady, and she said, oh
it’s you…”</p>
<p><strong>paul’s pov</strong>: down at the corpse, exactly as it was
last night.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well come on! How much easier do I have to
make this?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Holy– Margaret, you scared the wits out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: She just wants that bacon.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Such a little puppy. How late is “Rudys”
open?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You may want to take a gander. You may want to
take a gander…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sorry about this part.</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: If it’s any comfort to you, he
likely wasn’t eaten while conscious. Did he say where he’d been living,
before he came home?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Florida. He didn’t really talk about it much.
He brought us this shell.</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: –for dead, yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How did you…?</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Anonymous phone tip from some
Jamaican guy. Said he saw what looked like a body. We tracked you
through his ID.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Just like on TV.</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Mr. Barnell, I should warn you, an
animal attack isn’t pretty. There’s not much left.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They chewed his ears off. What kind of animal
does something like that?</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Normally I’d say bear, but these
tracks and the feeding pattern indicate wolf. It’s rare, but it can
happen.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Coroner found some smaller bite marks on
the ankle.</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Pups. Must have been the whole
freakin’ pack.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: You want an autopsy?</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Derek found this.</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Not the smartest snack for a
hiker.</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Messy animals aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Messy. Messy messy messy messy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I take it you’re done?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wanna hit some of mine?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now this is definitely a violation of Golf Dome
policy.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Must be all this talk about using your
wood.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Woods. So maybe later I can… check your
grip?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Secret?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My dirty talk sucks?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I like it when you try, though.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You know in some states they actually do this
outside?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: So how many insurance companies are there
in the United States? Like, a billion.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s not the point, Tiff. I’ve busted my ass
for Liberty Capital. I don’t want to quit. I deserve to be promoted out
of this ice bound backwater.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: And when it happens, I guess I’ll just be
another notch on your briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I can’t believe you said that. You know you
are…</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Sorry, what was that! You want to take me
right here?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hello? You’re kidding me. Yeah, I’ll hold.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Your Mom?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Million dollar life policy just checked.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: On a Saturday? What about the first annual
golf, sex and pizza triathlon?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, if this is… who I think it is, I may have
found us a ticket out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: We don’t need a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You won’t even know I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>corpse’s pov</strong>: Black. The drawer is pulled open. We
are…</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: That’s him. Raymond Barnell.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Could you?</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Ouch. That’s gotta hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So what’s your line on this?</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Just what it looks like. Wolves got
him. Maybe a grizzly with insomnia, but we didn’t find any tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Would it surprise you to learn his brother
tried to cash in his policy two weeks ago?</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: You trying to tell me Mr. Barnell
chewed off his brother’s leg?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Doesn’t that make you the least bit
suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Mr. Watters, this is a nice simple
ending. We like nice simple endings.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But shouldn’t you–</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Ya know, I don’t know thing one
about insurance, but I’m guessing it’s your job to find a way not to pay
these poor people.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Hey now, we’re just like you guys, gotta run
down whatever leads we can find.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Detective, we’re an insurance company, not the
Salvation Army.</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Mind telling me what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: They gave every claims team a video camera last
quarter… you’d be amazed at how it cuts down on litigation. We had this
case two months ago where this mother of six was claiming…</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: I’ve got my own war stories,
thanks. You mind stopping that?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Just doing –</p>
<p><strong>detective boyle</strong>: Your job? Yes, I caught that.</p>
<p><strong>tv news camera pov</strong>: Of Paul, standing on his stoop,
as he’s interviewed by a well made-up female TV REPORTER dressed for the
cold.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: You ready Mr. Barnell?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: The police told us what happened, how
are you folks holding up?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul? Who’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Obviously, my wife’s very upset…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul, the door’s stuck!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s been a tough, you know, when something
like this happens you just have to ask yourself…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Who fucked with the fucking door!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can see how stressful it’s been, I should
really go now. We have to plan a service.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: This isn’t a standard case. You were there when
this guy came in looking to cash in. C’mon, it stinks.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Secondly, if the police say this guy
was…</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Eaten by wolves. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Eaten by wolves, then we’ve got no case. Did
you see Mr. Barnell on the news last night? Last thing we need is bad
P.R. I don’t want this thing Valdeez-ing on us.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mr. Branch, I’m sure head office would take a
rather dim view of our –</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Corporate’s view will be whatever I tell
them.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Yes Sir. Color us called off, as of now.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Stop looking at me right now.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: You’ve got a strange way of bucking for a
promotion, my friend. Look, I’m gonna start on the Johnasen file. You
want to do up the paper work on Barnell?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Lunch.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: At 9:30?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The police say they found Raymond’s wallet,
that’s how they tracked you down?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s right, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Any idea what he was doing out there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’d go for walks. Hikes, I mean. Hiking.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: How sporty. Was he a big hiker?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not sure I follow.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Did he hike more than once a week? Or was this
a… one time thing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can I ask why you need to know all this?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Just trying to tie up a few loose ends.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know the police… they say Raymond died in
the attack. You do cover that sort of thing don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes sir. It shouldn’t take more than a few
days. Now, tell me a little more about your brother. The hiker.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Cod or Halibut?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Didn’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: So we got six different stores here. We got
your “Great Escapes” travel agency, your Ye Old Fish and Chips place,
Porn-a-Copia videos, a hair place, one for lease and one… what is
that?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Small engine repair. See all the snow blowers
out front.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: So, which one you figure would want to take
our friend?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I guess maybe the porn palace. Ya know for
some weird sex film.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Yeah, this place is just a hotbed of adult
cinema production. Fish shop look clean?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Very nice Korean family. You figure maybe they
battered him up?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Gary, this isn’t a joke. You ever known Dave
to joke?</p>
<p><strong>woman caller</strong>: …it could never happen. There’s never
been a documented case–</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Yeah, “Sorry.” I get strip searched and you
go off playing snow angels…</p>
<p><strong>radio host</strong>: Well, we’ve got one now, don’t we!?</p>
<p><strong>woman caller</strong>: That was different. From what I read
in the paper he was unconscious. And now people are going to use this as
an excuse to–</p>
<p><strong>radio host</strong>: Hey lady, why don’t you tell Raymond
Barnell how wolves have gotten a bad rap.</p>
<p><strong>woman caller</strong>: I can tell you from years of
experience that wolves do not operate–</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>radio host</strong>: You can tell me all you want, lady, but
it is an undeniable, indisputable fact. This Barnell guy got turned into
a Scooby Snack by a pack of wild animals…</p>
<p><strong>jim’s pov</strong>: Through the windshield, looking at the
sign for “Barnell Great Escapes Travel.” Jimbo and Gary look at each
other. Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, hi, it’s Ted Watters from Fidelity
Mutual. I need a complete credit work up on a Raymond Barnell… and Paul,
a Paul Barnell too… sure, I’ll hold.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: You start the month ends yet?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Can you take care of it? I’m kinda… working on
something.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Oh God, you’re not still on the Barnell thing
are you–</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I went to see him.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: And? Then? So?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Trust me. Something’s not right. I can smell
it. Help me buy a week.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: We’re gonna get in such trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I promise from now on you can come along on
everything.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: No more Cam goes to the coffee room and Ted
disappears for three hours?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: And you’ll work on your interpersonal
skills?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Good. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll go start
covering your ass.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey. How’s my Princess?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: OK. I took some Adavan. And called my
psychic.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Honey, you know how expensive that is. I
thought we agreed that…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Don’t be mad. It’s just… this week has
been so… well with Raymond getting eaten by animals and someone trying
to steal the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know. Why don’t you –</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We got another letter from the HMO
today.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Have you opened it yet?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just, fucking
cocksuckers.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “As we have stated previously… usual onset
before the age of 18… coupled with no genetic history…”</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m sick! I’m really, really sick!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shush, now. “We hasten to add, Tourette
Syndrome is not…”</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Fuck them.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “As well, please reference our previous
decisions regarding your claims for ADD, ODO, OCD,</p>
<p><strong>adhophi…</strong>: Honey. I know you don’t like to talk about
it, but maybe it’s not… what we might think it is but… maybe it’s just
stress? Remember that cruise? I saw you. You were happy.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: They say you can’t get it all of a sudden
but I did. I really, really did.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know. They just don’t –</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’ll kill myself. Then they’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That is nonsense talk.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Then you can go off and… …marry someone
normal.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re the most normal girl I know.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m not crazy, Paul. Something’s really
wrong with me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know, Sweetie. I know. And we’re gonna find
you the best specialists in… …what you have that we can.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I really think things are going to turn
around. Call me cr… I just have a feeling. You just leave everything to
me, OK? Is that OK? Leave everything to me? I promise.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Shit bag.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>edward g. robinson</strong>: “Every time one of these phonies
comes along it ties knots in my stomach… I can’t eat. That’s how I knew
your claim was crooked…”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: Hi there. That’ll be $12.97.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What about thirty minutes or free?</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: Doesn’t apply when it’s snowing.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So nine months of the year your guarantee is
worthless?</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: It doesn’t snow every day.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: They should really tell people when they
order.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Would you just give him the money
already?</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: It’s not my decision.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I know that. I’m just saying.</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You understand though?</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It wouldn’t take much.</p>
<p><strong>pizza guy</strong>: Full disclosure to the pizza consumer.
I’ll be sure to pass that along.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Why you gotta argue with the service
industry?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The problem with people today is they don’t
expect anyone to tell the truth. We’ve just come to accept lying as
acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: If this is another passive/aggressive shot
at Psychic Buddies, all our ads state “for amusement purposes only.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Tiff, it has nothing to do with… look, just
forget it.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: You remember being amused, don’t ya, honey?
What is with you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Want to know what’s “with” me? I’m on the verge
of cracking the biggest case of my career, one that corporate has to
notice, and nobody gives a crap. Not my boss, and not even my
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: So this is my fault?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, it’s not your fault. I just want to live
somewhere where road hazards don’t have antlers and the pizza doesn’t
have to be delivered by dogsled.</p>
<p><strong>edward g. robinson</strong>: “What kind of outfit is this,
anyway? Are we an insurance company or a bunch of dim-witted amateurs to
write a policy on a mug like that?”</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: You know, even though Edward G. Robinson
wins, everyone like Fred MacMurray better.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: It was terrible. Just terrible. Raymond
should have known better.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All these yours?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: Greatest sport on earth. Moved to a
compound bow two years ago. Arthritis. Less draw weight.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m fine. Did you talk to Raymond at all when
he came home? Was he getting along with his brother?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: No. Only saw him the once. Never spoke.
Waved to him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Waved?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: He was clearing my driveway. Raymond
was a real hellcat when he was younger. But like they say, time mellows
even the hardest soul.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Was he much of an outdoorsman?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: I thought it was Paul at first. Have
you met Paul’s wife? Now there’s a story. Not that I’m much for gossip,
but I think Raymond used to have a –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mrs. Wherry, I’m sorry, but –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: Sorry. Did Raymond like the outdoors.
Not so much, no. Liked living out here at the cabin, though. I think he
had some friends on the police force. Have you talked to them? They’d
pull up here day and night, always looking for –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m sorry, did you say you thought it was Paul
who did your driveway?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: Well in a ski mask you can hardly tell
who’s who. Now, how ’bout some jerky? I’ve got it drying out back.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s really super, Simon. Now how’d you like
to run some names for me?</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Now, now. Let’s not forget who’s pulling double
duty.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Simon, I’ll call you back. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Much better. So?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Turns out our Mr. Barnell is mortgaged to the
nuts. His business is about one step away from chapter 11. Plus it’s
like his brother Raymond never existed. He’s got no credit history, no
nothing for the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Ya know, not having a credit history isn’t
actually a crime. People around here have been known to swap a snow
mobile for 500 pounds of venison. Doesn’t exactly leave a paper
trail.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes, but he was in Florida, someplace. Plus,
the only thing he did after his recent “reappearance” was get some new
ID and a new credit card. Didn’t charge anything.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Wow. Less than nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s something.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: No it’s not… in my humble, junior
investigator’s opinion.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Watters, claims. Yeah, hang on… It’s personal.
I promise.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: When someone is taken from us at such a
young age we often ask ourselves, why? What possible purpose could this
serve?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: We should have checked the funeral
announcements right away.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That was lovely, thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Margaret, Paul, you two get some
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: …nun banger.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mr. Barnell. There was no hurry on this, we
could wait until–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s OK. We just wrapped up. This is my wife,
Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Okee dokee, smokee.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s under a little strain right now.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I see the media’s here. They don’t give people
a moment’s peace, do they?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I called them.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, they’ve been asking me to talk some more
about Raymond. I thought now might be an appropriate time.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And you’ll just happen to mention your
heartless insurance company that hasn’t paid off your policy yet.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I had to borrow money for the casket,
Mr. Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You are breaking my heart.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, I doubt that. They asked me to bring some
photos of Raymond. Guess it’s gonna be a pretty big story.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Enjoy your press conference, Mr. Barnell.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: That’s your plan?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: How tough can it be?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: You ever try digging through six feet of half
frozen sod? We’d need a back hoe. Can you operate a back hoe? Do you
know where we’d get a back hoe? We don’t even know for sure…</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Oh please. Don’t you think it’s a pretty neat
coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Maybe we just go explain it to Dave.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: He won’t take it well.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Then I’m all for new options, here, Gary. If
we give the money back–</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey, wait a minute, now. We did the job. We
deserve the–</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: I did the job, Gary. I know, because I
haven’t been sleeping for the last week.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I don’t know why you’re letting it get to you
like this. Look, let’s just not rush into anything. It’s my turn to step
up. I know that. I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hey little, Bambi. Where’s your Mommy?
Gettin’ it from some ten point buck. Yes she is. Yes she is.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Stay away from our fucking appliances.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Lady, just calm down.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You are in so much trouble.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Lady, so help me I –</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: So you’re a souvenir wholesaler?</p>
<p><strong>spellman</strong>: For the cruise ship trade, mostly. Usual
stuff, stuffed animals, your huskies, your moose, your baby seals, your
whales, your walrus –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: They came in through there?</p>
<p><strong>spellman</strong>: Yeah. Through that… big hole in the roof.
I got a list of all the things that are missing.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>spellman</strong>: Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing
the roof. Now I know you guys are gonna bust my –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fax over your estimate. We’ll have you a check
by Friday.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Ted. Maybe we should take a look at their
inventory list first?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: This is a simple case, Cam. Bad guys, through
roof, stole stuff. Let’s clear it and get going.</p>
<p><strong>spellman</strong>: I should tell you… we also had some VCRs
we were holding for another company. That could run another couple
of…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Cam? You wanna wrap this up? Gotta go primary
some time.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Mr. Spellman? Now I noticed a nice looking
computer in your office. Why do you think they left that?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You try and rape me, I swear to Christ
I’ll bite it off.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Okay, now here’s the thing, just keep an open
mind.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So what now, you gonna get me smokin’ from
both ends?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I just came to look around, but she started
yelling and hitting me…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh please.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: How the hell is this solving our problem? How
is this stepping up?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Just listen, okay.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Yeah, listen, if the fat from your neck
hasn’t stopped up your ears.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: This is not what we do.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: It is now.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Where would we stash her? Your place?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Too small, plus we’d have to get her in and
out without anyone seeing. And I’ve seen that sty you call an
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: See, it’s just a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Yeah. Maybe. You see the whirlpool tub?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: You can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: It could be like a little getaway.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey Maggie-magster. How ya –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Mr. Barnell. You have something that belongs
to us.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I, I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Do you remember a dead man you found in the
dumpster behind your office?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, I can’t say that… I mean that would
probably stick in my mind a… dead body.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Think hard Mr. Barnell.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I thought it might be some weirdo sex thing,
ya know? But you look like a pretty straight arrow. So then I’m
thinking, maybe it’s a scam. Maybe somehow our friend is worth some
money to you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We, we had a life insurance policy on my
brother. It was for… 100,000 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You know, it’s always you quiet guys. Here’s
how it’s going to work. We stay here with your wife, you go get our
guy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: We even see you or a cop even roll past, she’s
dead. Plus you’ll have to explain how you scammed the insurance people
out of their hard earned money. We’ll call you in three days. Have the
body and, let’s say 50,000 dollars for our trouble. Screw with us, we
start mailing your wife back to you.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: He gone?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: He was scared. Really scared.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: You used the feet thing, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Hey, little help here. I got Pop Tarts.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Shhhh. This is the important part.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: This stops now. This case is making me and
you crazy, especially you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t have any complaints about my… you.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Dead guy’s got a record? Cool.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah. He beat the hell out of some guy in bar
fight. Broke the guy’s eye socket.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I think you should read this again.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We don’t have any money, you know.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Lady. Please.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: If you want Raymond’s fucking insurance
money… we don’t have that either.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: It’s none of your business what we want.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s a disease. It’s called Tourette
Syndrome. I can’t control what I say. Turnip.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’ve taken a handicapped person hostage.
I hope you’re proud of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I saw this thing on TV where they said people
with that don’t usually curse.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: They must have got it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I don’t think so. It was a movie of the week
based on real events. Don’t most of Tourette’s people twitch and
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Over the sink. And what’s that supposed to
mean?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Nothing. Cumin?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: On the left. And I’m not… crazy, it’s a
physical disease. Sometimes I can control it, and sometimes –</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You can’t? Want to know what I think? I think
this “syndrome” is something you read about somewhere and figured, hey,
works for me.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Ass-rimming ball-sucker.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You can completely abdicate your societal
responsibilities, say whatever you want whenever you want, and slough it
off on a illness. Maybe I should catch this thing. “Gee, sorry Your
Honor, I have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s.” It’s called really
need a Slurpee disease.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’ve never robbed a 7-11 in your life
you shit eating fuck-weasel. What kind of man threatens a woman with a
gun, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You are so faking it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh, I’m faking it? Is this how you get
your kicks, you over-compensating pussy little fart sack?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey! Keep your voice down or the gag goes
back.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You don’t scare me. If something bad was
going to happen, my psychic would have told me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: Paul, sorry to hear about your brother.
You moving in?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Just for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: She’ll come to her senses. They always
do. Oh, the septic lines are frozen, so you’ll have to use the outdoor
commode.</p>
<p><strong>paul’s pov</strong>: A 7 year old time capsule of a party
that was never cleaned up; beer bottles, ashtrays and general
garbage.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Would it have killed you to clean up before
you left, Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>high angle on</strong>: Paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in
the same position we’ve seen him in when he sleeps with Margaret. An
electric heater glows beside him.</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: Car tires as they pull to a stop on the
main road. A pair of heavy men’s boots get out, start to make their way

<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: State Police. Is there a Mr. Barnell
here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, is there something wrong–</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Hello brother.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Raymond? Is that…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Page 16, Paul. That’s why I love “USA
Today”, news from every fuckin’ state. Don’t you want to read it? I was
eaten by wild fuckin’ animals. But ya know, despite that, I’m feeling
pretty God-damned chipper.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.
We all thought you were…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Dead? Yeah, I got that impression.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But you had dropped off the face of the
earth.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: And you just decide to make it
permanent?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But there were no records of you anywhere. I
checked.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: In certain lines of quasi-legal employment,
using your actual ID can be a hinderance. But despite the reliance on
aliases, it’s nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back
on. Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was pretty pissed.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Life insurance.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Figured. So where’s my money?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Your money? They’re still… investigating.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What you get?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fifty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Almost worth coming back for. What’s the
split? I get half?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay. Sure. You look good. Lost some
weight?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Gave up carbs. So what are you doing out
here? She not go along with it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Who? Margaret?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: How she hold up, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s fine. Actually, we’re not doing so good
right now.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Any kids? Still can’t get one by the
goalie, huh.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Talked to our friend. We’re okay for now.
How’s everything here?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Oh, just great. Seventy six, perfectly normal.
What a shock.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: He’s a little over tired.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: It’s been a rough week.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Really? Why? You and your life partner in
the shitter having trouble picking a China pattern?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Um, um… Gary?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Your turn to deal with it. If I come out of
this bathroom I’ll put a bullet in her head, swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I have a psychiatric disorder. And so do
you!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Watters. You said on the phone something
about a resolution in our claim?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mr. Barnell. Why are you staying out here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My wife and I, we’re having some problems.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Kind of understandable I guess. Seeing as how
you killed that man and dumped his body out in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You mean Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No. Not Raymond. Definitely not Raymond. I
thought it was at first, but that’s what was throwing me…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not sure I appreciate your tone.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: My tone, Mr. Barnell? You are going to jail. I
will personally see to that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I really think you should go now.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You are a liar and thief.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know Mr. Watters, I’ve had a pretty rough
night, so if you wouldn’t mind just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey. How’d you get all cut up?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: What’s say you just move away from
him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m fine, Mrs. Wherry. Just go back
inside.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: I can drop him if you want.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m fine. Really. I think you’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wherry</strong>: I’ve got some fishing line if you want
me to stitch that.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: He give you the check?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. He thinks I… It’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Maybe I’ll pay him a little visit. See if
we can speed up the process.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t have to… I figured out a way to take
care of things.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yeah, I was watching from the window.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can’t do that, Raymond. If someone sees
you…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Ya know, I been thinking there, Paulie.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: After we get her back from these guys who
grabbed her, you think your wife’ll be able to keep her mouth shut?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t think I…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Crazy people talk a lot. And I think if you
tell your therapist something, they can use it in court.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s not… she doesn’t have a therapist.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Still, might wanna think about it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Think about what?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie.
Fraud. Consorting with felons. Got to “cowboy up.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cowboy up?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Get tough, ya suck-hole. I’m just saying
sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions. Cull the heard, so to
speak. Paul, come on, just kiddin’ around, here. Don’t be such a fuckin’
stick.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I haven’t called the police yet, but I’ll tell
you it was certainly tempting.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Watters. Glad you’re… Mr. Barnell was just
telling me about the… meeting you two had.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I caught that, yes.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: As you can see… well, Mr. Barnell has some…
concerns.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You don’t think I did this?</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Ted, his neighbor says… otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now just hang on here. Let me show you
something…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: See? Where’s the birthmark? Your brother’s
police report listed it… “…large purple birthmark, upper left thigh…”
But I don’t see it. Not on this body. You can see it in the picture.
See?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It… did get better.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Did it now. Well how in the world did that
happen?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Raymond was always… bothered by it. When he
came back from… Florida, he’d had it fixed. Laser surgery… like removing
a tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He did not.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You taped my brother’s body, in the
morgue?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh for… he’s lying. It’s obvious he…</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: That will be just about enough of that.
Mr. Barnell, I’m sorry it’s all come to this. We’ll have a check brought
over to you tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sir, with all due respect, he’s –</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Jesus, we’re lucky he’s not suing. Now
tomorrow, you deliver the check to Mr. Barnell with a complete
apology.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fine, I understand how this looks –</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: It looks like you beat the hell out of one
of our policy holders. Now send Cam in here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: Well, while you were off on your little
Easter Egg hunt, your junior found us an out on that warehouse robbery.
Head office is bumping him a level.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll go get him.</p>
<p><strong>branch</strong>: They’re very keen on him. They want me to
feel him out on a transfer –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello… yes, I’m wondering what city department
would be in charge of… sure, I can hold. Hang on Mag Pie, just hang
on.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Listen you little prick, we’ve had just
about enough of this. You get me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ray -</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Hey Paul. Took care of our little problem
today. We should see some serious money any time, soon.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Could… I have a word with you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are those…?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Prostitutes? I sure as hell hope so, cause
Jehovah’s Witnesses won’t lick your lolly no matter how much you pay
them.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How did you get them here?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Put it on my plastic. See, got my name on
it and everything. It’s every where I want to be.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You can’t use that. You’re supposed to be
dead! They’ll track us down.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You think they give a shit who pays the
bill? Think for a minute, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What… Raymond, what is… this?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: That’s “muh gun,” Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, hello. Sorry, what?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: You having a party, Mr. Barnell? That’s…
that’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Thirty, sorry, startinnng… Now!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There’s no party…let me talk to my wife.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Twenty-five!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why are you counting?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul? Are you entertaining?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh God, oh Jesus… Margaret, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Paul, we got any more chips?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Fifteen! The body. Have you – No, I’m the
other guy. Have you got the body?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul, the carrot little weasly one wants
to carrot screw me with his sick carrot little cock. And he’s messing up
my kitchen. Carrotcarrocarrot…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You sick… Don’t you hurt her!!</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I never said anything like– Yes or no. Ten
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes! It’ll… it’ll happen tomorrow. Put
Margaret back on!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Paul! Chips!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I think I managed to avoid a trace.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: We’re staying at his house.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Hello. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Watters?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mr. Barnell. I have your check.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank you, I appreciate that. Please, sit.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I was mugged. The cops say it was just a random
act of violence. But who knows, right? You’ll have to sign.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, please. You don’t have to…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s quite the shell.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It was a gift from Raymond. He bought it for
me from Florida. It’s all we have to remember him by.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That and a million dollars. Things really
worked out for you, didn’t they? lots of cash, newly single guy…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not single.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: …so you gonna head down to Club Med? See how
much fun a big bank roll can buy?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Watters, I love my wife. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Can we level with each other for a moment? Did
you –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Avis! Avis?</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Oh, that’s where you went.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s quite the display.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: They do some very nice in store
promotions.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So, right here, by the X.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. A
lot of people find talking to a psychic very therapeutic. So what’s on
your mind, Carlos?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I have a situation. My wife… do you think it’s
okay to do something kinda bad to someone if you think they’re gonna do
something really bad to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What if it’s a really bad thing?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Well, you probably shouldn’t break the law
if you can help it. Are you really sure they’re going to do this other
thing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m… I… I don’t know. He said some things. He
said he was joking, but I… I think he might.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Don’t think, know. How close are you to the
other someone else, the one you’re trying to protect?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just, I just… Have you ever felt like that?
Like your own life didn’t even matter, as long as…</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Listen to me, Carlos. Your wife is an
incredibly lucky woman. I know, relationships are tough, but you do what
you gotta do to keep it together, okay? Remember, love is sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Now you get tough. And remember, this call
is for entertainment purposes only. Call me back and let me know how it
goes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s having sex with them.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Who’s doing what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Margaret. You know that Stockholm Syndrome
thing?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The movie?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When you fall in love with your
kidnappers.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I went by there. She was in the bedroom with
the big one. Not the first time, either. With other men, not
kidnappers.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: For real?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Her therapist. And some guy she… hardly
knew.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Wow. Sucks to be you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I always knew she was a fucking tease.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. Guess you were right.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Well, you want my opinion… I don’t trust
her, Paul. Never did.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You think she’d… really mess things up?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Only one way to make sure she doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not sure what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You remember that pooch Mom had? Crazy
little Jack Russel with the bladder infection?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Whole basement stank.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Nothing you can do but put the thing out of
it’s misery. And yours.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You… You sure, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Trust me, Bro’. Leaky dogs, crazy women.
Two things no man should have to live with.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Mr. Barnell? I didn’t expect you back today.
Nice jacket.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well… I am. And Avis?</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ve been with me for five years? Paul? Can
we make it Paul?</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Sure. I just thought it was more professional
when people were around to call you Mr. Barnell.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Avis. There haven’t been any people in here
for months. No one comes in here, unless they’re looking for
pornographic movies or deep fried fish, neither of which we carry. So
you can call me pretty much anything you want and it won’t impress the
customers at all because we don’t have any.</p>
<p><strong>avis</strong>: Are you OK, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No Avis, to be frank I’m a little frazzled
right now. Now could you get me some tape, my passport out of the safe
and two open-ended tickets to Paraguay.</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: Trouble is the city keeps cutting us back
and cutting us back.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Excuse me, are you Arnith?</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: That he didn’t want to be buried.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: He left it in a letter.</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: And you just got it now?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ya know, I don’t mean to be rude here, but I’m
not sure this is any of your business.</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: That’s entirely possible.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I, I don’t think this is anything to be
flippant about.</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: I appreciate that, Sir. But I’m on a union
specified break right now, which means you are talking to me as a
private citizen. Now as a private citizen I can pretty much say whatever
I want to. If you talk to me in 15 minutes I can assure you, you will be
afforded every courtesy as specified in the workers policy guide and
recently ratified in our latest collective agreement dated –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sorry. I’m just –</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: Trying to get your brother out of the
ground. We couldn’t be more pleased. You’ve arranged for transportation
of the remains?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We’re gonna take him to go.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: See, now that’s a problem. We can’t release
the body into your custody unless you are licensed by the state to
convey deceased persons.</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: Good point Bill. Bill knows exhumation
policy. You can look it up but I’m betting he’s right. You come back
with a bonded agent and we’ll get right on this.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll give you five hundred dollars to go get
him now.</p>
<p><strong>arnith</strong>: There ya go Mr. Barnell. Snug as a bug in a
rug. Anything else we can get you?</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: So… Miami, huh? Can you believe that? One
little case and “boom”, you’re the flavor of the month.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Congratulations. Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Say thanks. I really owe you. If you hadn’t
given me a shot on that–</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Forget it. I’m trying to.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: So we were all kinda wondering… what did happen
to your face?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Car trouble.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Should you be driving?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: We set?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Yeah. How you feel about the turnout by
Summit Hill where the snowmobilers park?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Tastes like a rectal polyp.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: How would she know.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Blowing town, are we, Mr. Barnell? I don’t
think so.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: See, I could have had her. We both know
that, but I figured, she was such a… I mean, I don’t know why… You know
why?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. You want a refill?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Does a duck shit under water?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They said it’d be in tomorrow by –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Right, right, you told me. Then all we have
to do is get her and the thing… Hey, remember that time in school, when
I jumped out and scared you, and you fucking pee’d all over
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Was pretty funny. Bottoms up.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Okay, “Puddles.” Remember how they called
you that? Huh, “Puddles?” Christ, what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s early. Come on… ya… …pussy.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Pussy!!!</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Gary! You seen my shirt?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: It relaxes me. You know it has twelve
different settings?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: No Gary, I don’t know that because every time
I thought about using it someone was in it.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey, I do a lot around here.</p>
<p><strong>911 recording</strong>: You have reached 9-11. All our
operators are busy, but your call will be handled in the order in which
it was received. If this is a –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’re out of coffee. But I’ll be right back.
Still early.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>automated voice</strong>: The number you have dialed is no
longer in service. If you think you have –</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah? Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh thank fucking Christ. Is Tiffany
there?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, she’s…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Well you should know, fuck-wit. You know
there’s a man with a gun in my shower, right now?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hang on, she’s on her way –</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I’m here, Margaret. How you feeling
today?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Give me the headset.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Christ, where do you want to start?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Sorry about that. Mrs. Barnell? Could you
speak up a bit?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What’s she saying?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Something about the gay mafia taking her to
a park to kill her. Can you hand me my Help Line list?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What… Wha…</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Margaret, are you sure these are real
people in your house?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Find out where she…</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Well then it’s a good thing you called.
Nope, not seeing any problems, but hang on, let me really
concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Ask her…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Shit on toast.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re sure this is it?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: She specifically mentioned the cock-sucking
turnout up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll call later.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I won’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I know relationships aren’t all sunshine
and roses, but I’m really not having fun anymore, and I don’t think you
are either.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: God, now’s so not the time, Tiff.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Maybe you have to be like this right now,
and I’m just not in a good space to deal with it. But…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Maybe we shouldn’t be like this
together.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: OK. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ve been cutting you out of my life and as a
result our normal communication channels have been blocked. I think you
coming with me would… would…</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: If you’re going to be sarcastic.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m not being anything. Swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Okay. Why do you want me to come?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Cause if you don’t, then I’ll have to stay, and
I’ll be mad at you and eventually we’ll break up over it, and as bad as
my life is right now, that would make it a million times worse.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Mr. Bennett, she’s totally cool with it.
but listen, you’re gonna have to call back… I gotta go help my
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Okay, it’s called the listening game. You
talk, I listen, and I can’t interrupt. Then we switch.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Doesn’t sound like much of a game, but… I can
talk about anything?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: See the little box down there? Lists all the
symptoms of that Tourette’s thing, and you don’t have half of them.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: And? And you’re faking it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Magazines don’t prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Gary, can we just try and get there in
peace?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Magazines prove everything!!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: That little prick!!!</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: I’m still not sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Jimbo. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: It’s a thought, okay. With hard work, you can
live okay as a civilian.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: After all this…</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Yeah, after all this.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Don’t you go soft on me, Jimbo.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: So this is kind of like a really weird “Law
and Order” episode?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sure. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: And if Paul Barnell already killed his
brother…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Maybe his wife is next.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Cool. My turn? Now a healthy relationship
is…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Calibre?</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Mr. Barnell. I’ll assume you’ve got our
friend back there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. You can let her go now.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: So, do you have a plan here?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m gonna go talk to him. You mind staying
here?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I guess. So when do we call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Soon as I… if he actually is doing… something.
I’ll wave, alright?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: That’s a very good plan.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That was…</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: How do we know it’s him?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on! Where would I get another one?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Excuse me. Aren’t you… Raymond Barnell?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I know you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re… You’re dead?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Go away, now.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, I don’t know exactly what’s going on
here, but if you would come with me to my office, just for a few
minutes, it would really help me out with my boss.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: See, your brother has, and I use this term
carefully, stolen a million dollars from my insurance company. Now if
we–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s all over honey. It’s all over. Did they
hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Does food poisoning count? Have you been
eating?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know me when I get busy.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Did you fall?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Just a little. Hey, we’re gonna get…</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Who the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Honey, I need you to start walking to that
hill over there, alright?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll catch up in a bit. Now, no matter what
you hear, just keep going, alright. And if I’m… late or something, just
look in the coat, alright?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Jimbo?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: A million dollars, Paul!? You really think
you could take me? Again!</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: What million dollars?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Raymond… please.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Hey! What the fuck!!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: And you do?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: Gary! Just –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You win, tough guy.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh God… Oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh fucking hell… I can’t… breath.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can you stand.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Is… The Pope… a…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay, easy…</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: He just, fell… Oh Jesus, oh God.</p>
<p><strong>jimbo</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Look at me, you little…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Where do think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Ted, leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, no, no. I have been beaten, humiliated, had
my head squeezed by a guy… and I am getting some answers, right now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well go ahead. I can still kind of hear out of
this one.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I love my wife, Mr. Watters. And when you love
someone, I mean, really love someone…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I want a fucking Hallmark card or the lyrics to
a Foreigner rock ballad, I’ll go to the mall, Mr. Barnell.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: They call this the listening game.
Mr. Barnell, you get to go first.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Knock yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey yourself.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: So where you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Somewhere close. My three o’clock’s been moved
up.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Cool. You alright about everything?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah. The life policy was written on his
brother, and he did, you know, die. I may be rationalizing a bit, but
ethically I think I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Good. I like it when you’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Learning to.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Pauly, know it sounds corny but I miss you
so much! Wish you could have come. Saw some dolphins today. Frisky
little buggers. They were even playing our song in the bar. Have been
pondering about your question, and I think my answer is “yes.” After
all, it’s no fun in the sun without…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Pretty damn good.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Can you?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Why don’t we go there after? Fine. We’ll do it
now.</p>
<p><strong>dave’s wife</strong>: Watch the curb.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Looks like weather.</p>
