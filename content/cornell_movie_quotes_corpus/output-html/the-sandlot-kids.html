<h1 id="the-sandlot-kids">the-sandlot-kids</h1>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Everyone’s got that one summer when they
were a kid… a summer so perfect, that it stays with them forever. It
stays caught in time, like Camelot. pause That summer is like a book
with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story
you could ever dream up.</p>
<p>****: This is a story about a legend. And for us, that summer was the
one when the legend got made.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Everybody sometime in their life has met a
real live hero.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: They’re not exactly a dime a dozen, but
there’s plenty of people who’ve done real great things. But hardly
anyone has ever met a certified Legend, because most of them are dead
before they get voted one.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: So, to actually be there at the moment one
gets made… well, forget about it. It never happens. Almost never… To
understand how it all got started, you have to go back…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …to the all-time, hands down, complete and
undisputed Legend that ever lived.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In any language, in any country, in any
world. The Sultan of Swat. The King of Clout. The Great Bambino. You
have to go back to…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …The Babe.</p>
<p>****: There’s never been anyone greater than The Babe. And when he
called his famous full count homerun in the 1932 world series, he made
sure he’d live forever.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And it’s a good thing he became immortal,
because without him, what happened that summer, absolutely never</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: would’ve happened. Weird thing was, before
I moved to the neighborhood, I had no idea who he was. And he played a
game I knew nothing about.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Fourteen years later, after The Babe was
gone, there was another guy who had something to do with the legend
getting made too. A guy who set a record that summer that was so
awesome, some people still don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Safe!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Thirty-one! Maury Wills just stole number
thirty-one!</p>
<p>****: Crap! Can’t beat that guy! Ya dufuses, why’d ya get him in a
pickle for?! Ya know he’s the damn pickle king! Rubba legs for sure!
Truly rubba legs.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Game over. Sixteen zip. Murderers’ Row
remains undefeated.</p>
<p><strong>opponent</strong>: Hey! We never got our ups!</p>
<p><strong>opponent</strong>: All your moms wear boxers!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Milk-milk-pee.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Great, I’m dyin’ a thirst and you pee me
out!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Ham, it ain’t really.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Then switch with me.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Do I look stupid?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I moved to the neighborhood about a month
before school let out. I was from another state, and didn’t have a
single friend in a thousand miles.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was a lousy way to end up the 5th
grade, ’cause I had zip time to make friends before summer. And that’s
about where it all started…</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Fifth grade’s history, man. A hundred days,
man. A Hundred days of baseball. All Day, everyday, as much as we can.
That’s the best.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: We got all summer.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: We got all summer.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Let’s play.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-Yeah… let’s play.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Everyone but the Timmons twins lived on my
new block.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: They lived in a house by the sandlot and
had the world’s greatest tree house, because their dad was a
contractor.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Even before I knew any of them I envied
that tree house…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …later, it would become second only to
Cape Canaveral as a command post for history.</p>
<p>****: When I moved in that summer, I’d never played baseball, but it
wasn’t too tough figuring out who these guys’ heroes were. So, after a
week of watching… I figured baseball seemed like the best way to get in
with them.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Sorry, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I thought we agreed we’d take this apart… and
not spend so much time in here.</p>
<p>****: I know - but it’s just nighttime.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Scotty, have you made any friends yet?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Why not, honey?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: ’Cause I’m still “new.”</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Honey, I don’t want you sitting in here all
summer fiddling with this stuff, like you did last summer… and the one
before that.</p>
<p>****: Scotty, look at me. I know you’re smart, and I’m proud of you.
But you have to get outside, you have to… play.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I want you to get out in the fresh air and make
friends. Run around and scrape your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees and
hop fences. Get in trouble for crying out loud.</p>
<p>****: Not too much, but some. You have my permission. Now how many
mothers do you think say that to their sons?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: None mothers I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I want you to make friends this summer, Scotty.
Lots of them.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I know, but I don’t - I’m no good at
anything. Face it, Mom, I’m just an</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: - and you’ll always be just an egghead with an
attitude like that. So promise me, alright?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: ’Kay.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Maybe tomorrow you’ll make some friends.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p>****: Mom? Do you think Bill - I mean Dad - will teach me to play
catch?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Are you kidding, he’d love it, you know what an
athlete he wasIn high school.</p>
<p>****: You know what a pitcher he was in high college.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My real dad died when I was just a little
kid. My mom married Bill a year before we moved to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>****: At the time, he and I were still getting used to each
other.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember you
promised you’d teach me to play catch?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Um hum…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Well, could you teach me?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Okay. Great. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Um hum.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Hey-hey, come on! Wait up - wait up!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: They never kept score. They never chose
sides. They never even really stopped playing the game… it just went on
forever. Everyday they picked up right where they left off the day
before. It was an endless “dream game.”</p>
<p>****: There was only 8 of them, so they didn’t have a whole team. It
didn’t matter though… Benny was so good he took everyone’s position when
it was there ups.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t know any of that then… I just knew they were having
the time of their lives and I wanted to be a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Hey! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Nice catch!</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: Nice catch!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Hey! Throw the ball back!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: We gotta a game here, man!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: ’Kay, I’ll get it!</p>
<p>****: Don’t be a goofus - don’t be a goofus - don’t be a goofus.</p>
<p>****: My life is over.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: Come on, Benny-man, didn’t you see that
throw?</p>
<p>****: That kid’s got the gaw’damn panty- waistiest arm I ever saw in
my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: I seen a guy once that threw like that. I
mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth
grade ’cause they nicknamed him “Bloomers.”</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I bet not one of you knows how The Babe got
his nickname.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Easy, ’cause of the way he looked like a little
kid face.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Bull, it’s just ’cause he liked kids and
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe,
because he was like the child of Yankee Stadium.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I knew it. You’re all full of crap. George
Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a
little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Nobody liked him there. The bigger guys
picked on him all the time. And when they messed with him he couldn’t
fight back, ’cause he was just… like scared. So when they messed with
him, he cried about it.</p>
<p>****: He cried… so they called him The Babe.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: How ya think that kid just felt?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Everyone knew Benny was different. Nobody
ever voted or anything, but he was the leader.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Even though he seemed like a regular guy,
he wasn’t. Benny was special, and he was loyal.</p>
<p>****: When they’d all tried out for youth league, they’d all made it.
But when they found out they’d have to play on different teams, Benny
told ’em that if they couldn’t play together, they shouldn’t play at
all. So, they stayed together.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: So, the only person that ever felt sorry
for me ’cause I was such a weenie was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.</p>
<p>****: Even though neither of us knew it at the time, we were
connected. Like I had been born for just that one moment, when I would
perform the world’s all- time boner, and Benny would bail me out.</p>
<p>****: Connected as friends… born to meet for just that one
moment.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p>****: Well?…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: He’s too busy, Mom.</p>
<p>****: Go back in there and ask. He’ll take the time. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Um, Da -</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: - I mean, Bill. Could we… I mean could you,
like you said - teach me to catch today?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta get this
done.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Bill, can’t you take a break and teach him
now?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Mom, it’s okay -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Honey, I said I would and I will. I’m just
under the gun here, ya know?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Mom, really -</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: - How long could it take? You can’t spare a
half hour to show him?</p>
<p>****: Fine. Alright. I’ll get my glove. Come on.</p>
<p>****: There. See. Told you so.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up
where it goes. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, okay, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Darn. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s alright, just throw it back.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Okay. I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up
where the ball goes.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Darn. My glove got -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: - not bad. Right side at least. Now, just
throw it back this time.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: But my glove -</p>
<p>****: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Alright, Scott, listen, this one’s gonna come
right at you, easy, okay?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: ’Kay.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just keep your eye on the ball and put your
glove up. You’ll catch it.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh my -</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: - God, whadda jerk!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Bill! What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, he -</p>
<p>****: - just took my eye off the ball, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There. Keep that on for an hour. It’ll still
be black, but it won’t swell.</p>
<p>****: Sorry. We’ll try again soon.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Gonna go play some ball. Need a extra guy.
Wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Naw. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Why not? Doncha like baseball?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh. Yeah. But, ah…</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: But my glove’s busted. So, ya know, I can’t
go. Thanks, though.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I got a extra one.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Mom! I’m gonna go play some ball!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Thanks. Cool glove.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah. Cool shiner. We gotta stop by the 5
&amp; 10 first. Need a new ball. And chaw and stuff, ya know?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You dip chaw?</p>
<p>****: Sure. A’course.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Hey! Check me out! I’m the Great Bambino!</p>
<p>****: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: What?…</p>
<p>****: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Were you born in a barn, man?</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, what planet are you from?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: You never heard of The Sultan of Swat?!</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: The Titan of Terror!</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: The Colossus of Clout!</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: The Colossus of Clout!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: The King of Krash!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I had no idea who they were talking about.
But there was no way I could let them know that… so, I lied.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh! The Great Bambino! Of course. I thought
you said The Great Bambi.</p>
<p>****: That wimpy deer?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Ah, yeah - I guess. Sorry.</p>

<p><strong>benny</strong>: He’s gonna play with us. He makes nine. Now

<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Why’d you bring him for, Benny?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: ’Cause there’s eight of us, and he makes
nine.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn’t
bring her!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: With nine Guys we got a whole team.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: No, with Elswenger we had a whole team, and
Elswenger could throw!</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: He ain’t game, Benny. He can’t throw for
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Benny, you already play all the empty
positions since Elswenger moved to Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: And now I get to rotate 8 positions instead

<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Everyday, first thing, we’d all pick a
card from what we called “The Dugout.”</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was just a shoe box, but whoever we
picked, we got to be when it was our ups. One day, when Ham took his
pick a little too seriously, the guys let me in on the world’s most
terrifying secret…</p>

<p><strong>benny</strong>: You can’t go back there, Smalls.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Then how do we get the ball?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Forever even.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: Forget it, it’s a memory.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Game’s over. We’ll get a new one tomorrow.
Just forget it. We’ll never see it again.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p>****: The Beast.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Go over there, real slow, and be quiet. Don’t
touch the fence, just peek through that hole in the green stuff… go
on.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Something got the ball!</p>
<p>****: What was that thing?!</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Campout.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Wanna s’more?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Some more of what?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: No. You wanna s’more?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I haven’t had anything yet, so how can I
have any more of nothing?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: You kill me Smalls. Look, these are s’mores
stuff. Pay attention:</p>
<p>****: First you take the graham - you put the chocolate on the
graham, Hershey’s of course - you hold the chocolate on the graham while
you roast the mallow-</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: -then when the mallow’s flamin’, ya stuff it on
the chocolate and cover it with the other end.</p>
<p>****: Then, you scarf.</p>
<p>****: Kinda messy… Good though.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Alright, listen up.</p>
<p>****: First time DeNunez heard this story he</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: - Bull, Squints!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You did, man.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his
pants.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Shut up, Squints - did not!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: You did, man.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: And when The Ham heard it he barfed up two
bags of marshmallows.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Liar! It was only one.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: So stay away from the door… you might fall
out. And don’t sit on your sleeping bag… you could shit your pants.</p>
<p>****: Now, quiet…</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: The legend of The Beast goes back a long
time… before any of us could pick up a baseball. Back to a place called
Mertle’s Acres.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: The Beast belongs to Mr. Mertle, the guy
that used to own Mertle’s Acres Junkyard. And nobody’s ever seen him
since the day it happened…</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Mertle’s Acres was a bitchin’ place, that
had everything you could ever imagine.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: And the stuff was worth a fortune. So, one
day Mr. Mertle got him this new pup from the pound. They were glad to
get rid of him, on account of while he’d been there, he’d killed three
dogs bigger than he was.</p>
<p>****: That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured he needed to protect
his junkyard, ’cause people kept stealing stuff at night, when he wasn’t
around.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: So he bought The Beast, and set him loose
in Mertle’s Acres.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: The Beast was still just a pup of six
months, but he already weighed a 150 pounds… and he kept gettin’
bigger.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: He threw The Beast a trash bag full of meat
every night, and just left him alone. All alone in the whole place by
himself… to grow.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: And so, in a few months, the pup grew into
The Beast. And he grew big as a car. And he grew mean, ’cause nobody
liked him, and he didn’t like nobody either.</p>
<p>****: And so he only had one thing on his mind… to kill.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: And he did. And he liked it.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: The Beast was the most perfect junkyard dog
that ever lived… a true killing machine.</p>
<p>****: After awhile, the police started getting phone calls from
people, reporting all the missing thieves. The ones The Beast had
killed… it added up to about 37 guys.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: But they never found a single body… not
one. Some people say they all got away, and were just so scared that
they ended up in insane asylums and stuff.</p>
<p>****: But we know what really happened.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: The Beast… ate them.</p>
<p>****: He ate them bones and all.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: The Beast was good at his guarddog job. Too
good. So the cops said he had to be retired. But he didn’t have to be
killed or nothin’, on account of there was no evidence… no bones… no
teeth for dental records.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: The police told Mr. Mertle that if wanted
to keep The Beast, he hadda lock him in his backyard, so he could never
get out.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: And that he hadda chain him up, so’s in
case he tried to get out to eat children and stuff, he couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Mr. Mertle asked the cops how long he had
to keep his pup chained up like a slave.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: They said… until forever.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: And so… The Beast sits there under that
lean-to, dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get
out… dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: See, man. That’s why you can’t go over
there. Nobody ever has. Nobody ever will.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: One kid did, but nobody ever seen him
again.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: That ain’t true -</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: - yeah it is! He got eaten!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah - that kid who went to get his
kite… what was his name?</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: “Boogers” Fleming?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: No. It was that guy with the warts on his
face.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: Davy “The Toad.”</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Davy “The Toad” Stodenrous.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Yeah, The Toad…</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, poor Toad.</p>
<p>****: Nuh-uh… none of that’s true. You guys are just -</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: - oh, yeah?… Come here. Stick your head out
the window and look down.</p>
<p>****: He’s down there!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: You bet he is.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Whatever goes over that fence… stays there.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: It becomes the property of The Beast…
Forever.</p>
<p>****: FROM THE SANDLOT… a FULL MOON hangs ominously over the tree
house; a glowing little box of debate in the scary night.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I learned that more than a 150 baseballs
had gone over that fence… and not one of them was ever seen again. Even
when some brave kid worked up enough courage to peek over the fence.</p>
<p>****: Because, when they went over, they vanished.</p>
<p>****: I knew it was true, because when I looked down in there, I
didn’t see a single… solitary… one.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What took you so long?! We been here forever
already!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Squints was pervin’ a dish.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Shut up, I wasn’t!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-Yeah you were! Yer tongue was
hangin’ outta yer head and you was swoonin’!</p>
<p>****: Oh-oh Wendy Peffercorn my darling lover girl…</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Hold me back! Hold me back!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: I am holdin’ you back Squints.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Oh, yeah. Well, lemme go then.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: So, where’d you get the money this time
Yeah-Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Oh, yeah-yeah! It was great! So I went
around pretended like I was selling perscriptions to magazines. And the
people asked if they should pay me now. So I said yeah-yeah, pay me now!
And they did!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Sonavabitch!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: What-what?! I’ll take it back. I know it
was crappy, but I didn’t have no money, I -</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: - naw, don’t, man. He’s just mad he didn’t
think of it.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Yeah, you know how many lawns I hadda mow when
it was my turn?! Geez. Let’s play.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: I can’t take it no more, Benny. I’m bakin’ like
a toasted cheeser!</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: It’s hotter than the fires of hell.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: It’s hotter than a fish in a fryin’ pan.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Come on, don’t be wimpy.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Face it, Benny. It’s not a fit day out for
man nor beast. We gotta call it for the day.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Vote then. Everyone that wants to be a
can’t-hack-it panty waist, and wear their momma’s bra, raise your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Fine. Be like that. So what’re we gonna do
then?</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Scam Pool Honeys!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Hamonball!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Benny would’ve played ball all day and all
night… rain shine, tidal wave, whatever, it didn’t matter. Baseball was
the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of
time.</p>
<p>****: But, of all the things we ever did besides baseball, goin’ to
the pool was what he tolerated best. Even though none of us had ever
seen a Playboy magazine - which we constantly lied about - we figured
the pool was the next best thing to being there.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It wasn’t the Pool Honeys like we said,
’cause if any one of them had come up to any one of us, we’d of peed our
pants.</p>
<p>****: We went for… the Lifeguard.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And one day, it became too much for
Michael “Squints” Palledorous. And he did the most desperate thing any
of us had ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, too cruel.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: She don’t know what she’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: She don’t know what she’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah she does. She knows exactly what she’s
doing.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: I’ve swum here every summer of my adult
life… and every summer there she is.</p>
<p>****: Lotioning… oiling… smiling.</p>
<p>****: I - can’t - take - this - no - more!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p>****: Don’t-know, but that’s the deep end, and Squints can’t
swim!</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Squints!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Oh my God! He’s drowning!</p>
<p><strong>lifeguard</strong>: You little pervert!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Did you plan that?!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: A’course I did. Been plannin’ it for
years.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Michael “Squints” Palledorous walked a
little taller that day. And we had to tip our hats to him. He was lucky
she hadn’t beat the crap out of him. We wouldn’t have blamed her. What
he’d done was sneaky, rotten and low.</p>
<p>****: And cool.</p>
<p>****: Not another one among us would’ve ever, even for a million
dollars, had the guts to put the move on the Lifeguard. He did. He had
kissed a woman. And he kissed her long and good.</p>
<p>****: We got banned from the pool forever that day… but every time we
walked by after that, the Lifeguard looked down from her watchtower,
right over at Squints… and smiled.</p>
<p>****: the scene with NATIVES atop the wall when Kong grabs</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Eee! Eee! Eee! Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Hey, check me out! I’m the mighty King
Kong!</p>
<p>****: Hey! C’mon! It was a joke, ya dopes! Do I <em>look</em> like a
monkey?!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Yeah. Ya smell like one too. Hey
guys, it’s the sandlot babies!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 2</strong>: Skin yer knees lately sliding on
rocks?!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Shut up, blockhead.</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 2</strong>: What’re you gonna do, Porter, sit on
me?!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Rodriquez, why do hang around with
these rejects, man? You could be playin’ with us on a official American
Youth League certified big time diamond. You’d make the Allstar team
easy.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Play us and you’ll find out why,
Phillips.</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Forget it, we play real ball, not
with toy bats and sneakers!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Benny, man, are we gonna let ’em get away
with that?!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah. For now. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You think he really died in the end?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: King Kong…</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Not possible. He’s so big that fallin’ off
the Empire State’s just like us fallin’ off a roof… he’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: So whadda you think happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Most likely.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Hey, guys? Has anyone ever really seen The
Beast?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Look, Smalls. You ever seen King Kong for
real? In person, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: No. But -</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: - well, he’s real right?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, a’course.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: And he’s still out there somewhere
right?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: See, there’s just somethings that are. Ya
know, stuff that it’s better not to talk about… ‘cause thinkin’ about it
just makes it worse.</p>
<p>****: Nobody has to see The Beast to know he’s there.</p>
<p>****: You don’t think that The Beast is really…</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: King Kong? Naw! God is that stupid! No
stinkin’ way! Oh boy, had me feelin’ like a douf there for a minute!
Whew, what a relief!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Hey, who d’ya think’d win in a fight, King Kong
or Godzilla?</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Godzilla. King Kong. ’Zilla! Kong!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, wait a sec, maybe they’ll do a
movie someday and we’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Yeah. That would be cool. I’d see that. Kong
would kick his ass. No way, ’Zilla’s got that fire breath stuff, he’d
fry the monkey!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Besides The Great Bambino, who I still had
no clue about, Benny had one living hero.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, here he comes. He’s gonna
steal second.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Naw he ain’t, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A guy that would break the stolen bases
record that year that had stood for as many years as there were
baseball’s lost to The Beast.</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: He’s gonna go, Benny. Here he goes, man. Right
now, watch, watch. There, there!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: No… not yet.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Maury Wills became a hero for what he
did.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: He’s… gonna… go… riiiight… now.</p>
<p>****: How’d you know that? How’d you guess? How’d ya know?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Benny… would become a Legend.</p>
<p>****: Get your glove, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Nightgame!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: There was only one nightgame a year. On
the Fourth of July, the whole sky would brighten up with fireworks,
giving us just enough light for a game.</p>
<p>****: We played better then too. Because I guess, we all felt like
Big Leaguers under the lights at some great stadium.</p>
<p>****: Benny felt like that all the time.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: We all knew Benny was different. We knew
that he was gonna go on to bigger and better games.</p>
<p>****: Because everytime we stopped to watch the sky that night like
regular kids, Benny was there to call us back.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: For him, baseball wasn’t just a game. For
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …baseball was life.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Truly rubba legs.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: Truly rubba legs.</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 2</strong>: It’s easy when you play with rejects
and fat kids, Rodriquez.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What’id you say, crapface?</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: He said, they shouldn’t be allowed
to even touch a baseball. They’re an insult to the game.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Come on! We’ll take you on right here, right
now! Come on! Right now!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: We play on a real diamond, Porter.
And you ain’t good enough to lick the dirt off our cleats.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Watch yer mouth, jerk!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Shut up, dipshit!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Scab eater!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Butt sniffer!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Pus licker!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Fart smeller!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Dog crap for breakfast eatin’
geek!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: You mix yer Wheaties with your momma’s toe
jam!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: You bob for apples in your toilet,
and you like it!</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>leaguer punk 1</strong>: Tomorrow. Sun-up. At our field. Be
there, buffalo-butt breath.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Count on it, pee drinkin’ craphead.</p>
<p><strong>scotty/bertram</strong>: I got it. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>scotty/bertram</strong>: I thought you had it.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Somebody get it!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: You - are - out - of - here! Out! Gone! Dead!
To the moon! Roger, Wilco, Over and OUT!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Ah, you’re out.</p>
<p>****: That’s one. Get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Crack! Boom! Outta here! You see the looks on
their faces? Did ya? It was like, “Duh… so that’s how you play
baseball.”</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Crap! I almost forgot. Chaw!</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: I was savin’ it for a good time.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Geez, Smalls… I s’pose you don’t who The Babe
is either. It’s chaw. Plug. Wad. Chewing Tobacco!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Whadda you do with it?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: You’re killin’ me, Smalls. You chew it, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: All the pros do.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, gives ya tons of energy.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Let’s dip.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: Let’s dip.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Smooth.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Juicy.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Tangy.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Kinda tastes like an ashtray smells.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: Supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Let’s ride.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’ll be back in an hour, Scotty, I’m taking Dad
to the airport.</p>
<p>****: ‘Kay. Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Chicago, on business for a week. Listen,
Scott, while I’m gone, you’re the man of the house. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ll take another stab at catch when I get
back, okay? So, take care of things while I’m gone. I’m counting on
you.</p>
<p>****: Okay. I will.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Once we got over trying to be big shots,
we just stuck to what we could handle, and swore off the hard stuff
forever. When we finally got back together for some baseball, something
amazing happened.</p>
<p>****: It was an omen… one that was meant just for Benjamin Franklin
Rodriguez.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Whad’ya get, Ham?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: A Mickey Mantle and 7 guys I never heard of.
How ’bout you?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: A Brooks Robinson and a Koufax. Pretty
good.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: I got junk.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: One Drysdale, a bunch a duds.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, me too. Four bombs, but one
Whitey Ford.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Benny, whad -</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Hey, Benny, whatsa matter?</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: You okay, man?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Imfuckingpossible.</p>
<p>****: Unstinkinbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: Imfuckingpossible. Don’t tell mom I said
that tim.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: This can’t happen… can it?</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: It just did.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, it’s an omen.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Oh geez… Oh geez. I - I don’t believe it.
Maury Wills just stole 80 bases!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: We gotta play. I gotta play right now, guys.
Right now.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: What’s it mean?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: It’s a miracle, Smalls. A damn miracle.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: We all expected something to happen right
then… during that game. What we had just witnessed was bordering on the
supernatural… we knew that greater hands than ours were at work.</p>
<p>****: And it happened alright.</p>
<p>****: It happened right in front of our noses… and we didn’t even
know it.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Bitchin’.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Naw, it ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: C’mon, Benny, maybe two, three guys in
history have ever busted the guts out of a ball. That’s what the omen
was.</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Truly. Sure. Absolutely. Yeah-yeah, Benny. It
must be so.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: All’s it means is that we can’t play no more.
It’s only noon, and I just blew the whole day for us.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: No, you didn’t. It’s the most amazing thing
I ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Anybody got any money?</p>
<p>****: Then it ain’t okay, ’cause now we can’t play no more.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, we can.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What, you got 98 extra cents just layin’
around at home, Smalls?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: No, but I got a ball.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I got it! Let’s play!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Bitchin’. Your ball, your ups.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Batter up!</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Nice crank, Smalls.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: Decent cut.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: It’s outta here! Who’s got the big bat now,
boys!</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Smalls. Smalls. Smalls. Smalls.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: What the hell’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Maybe the shock of his first homer was just
too much for him.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: We gotta get that ball back.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Right! Good one, Smalls.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Sure. We’ll just hop over and say, excuse
me Mr. Beast sir, could we have our ball back, oh, and please don’t kill
us while we’re here!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: It was a great shot, but forget about it…
game’s over. We’ll get another ball.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Sure we do. You feel bad ’cause you belted a
homer, and now we can’t play no more.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: No! You don’t understand! THAT WASN’T</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Whadda you mean it wasn’t your ball?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: It’s my stepdad’s. I stole it from his
trophy room. It was a present or soemthing - somebody gave it to him. We
have to get it back. He’s gonna kill me!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Smalls… listen to me. This is a matter of
life and death.</p>
<p>****: Where did your old man get that ball?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I dunno… I think some lady gave it to
him.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Some lady?…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, she even signed her name on it.</p>
<p>****: Some lady named Ruth… Baby Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: The Beast got it.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: You’re dead as a doornail, Smalls.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: You’re dead as a doornail, Smalls.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Nice knowing you.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: Nice knowing -</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: - shut up, Tommy.</p>
<p>****: Smalls, you mean to tell me you went home and swiped a ball
that was signed by Babe Ruth, and brought it out here and actually
played with it?</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: And actually played with it?!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, but I was gonna put it back.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: But it was signed by Babe Ruth!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Well, who is she?!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: What?! What?!</p>
<p>****: What did he say?!</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: The Sultan of Swat!</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: The King of Krash!</p>
<p><strong>repeat/timmy</strong>: The Colossus of Clout!</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: The Great Bambino!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest
baseball player that ever lived. People say he was less than a God, but
more than a man. Ya know… like Hercules or somethin’.</p>
<p>****: The ball that you just aced to The Beast is worth… well, more
than your whole life.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I don’t feel so good.</p>
<p>****: We gotta get that ball back.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: When does your old man get home from
work?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: He’s gone on business for a week.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Okay, we need 98 cents. So, everybody spread
out and find some soda bottles and cash ’em in. We need a new
baseball.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: I dunno, Benny-man.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, it’s pretty crappy.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: He ain’t gonna buy that, Benny. It doesn’t
look anything like the Babe’s signature.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: It doesn’t matter what it looks like. His
mom’s never gonna know the difference. This’ll just buy us some time, ya
dorks.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Scotty?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Huh?!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Honey, what are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Ah… just looking at Bill’s - I mean Dad’s
baseball.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You know he doesn’t like you touching his
things.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Has he ever told you about that ball?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Uh - no, not really, I don’t think so - no,
he hasn’t at all - I don’t know <em>anything</em> about it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s signed by Babe Ruth…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: …the greatest baseball player that ever
lived.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Um… really?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It sure is. Dad’s father gave it to him. Maybe
someday, he’ll give it to you.</p>
<p>****: Uh… neat.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was salt in an open wound. Even my own
mom, who was only a grown-up girl, knew who Babe Ruth was.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: So, how do we get it back?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I was dead meat. I knew it. They knew it.
We had thought that those cards Benny had gotten meant that something
great was going to happen. Now I figured that they’d just meant my life
was over.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Can’t we just hop the fence and get it?</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: Remember Davy Stodenrous.</p>
<p><strong>timmy/repeat</strong>: Poor Toad.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh, yeah. I forgot.</p>
<p>****: Hey? Why don’t we just go over there and knock on the door, and
ask Mr. Mertle to get it for us?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Are you outta your mind?! Mr. Mertle is the
meanest old man that ever lived! He’s the one that sicked The Beast on
The Toad!</p>
<p>****: That’s not an option, Smalls. Forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Oh. Okay. I will.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: We need to assess the situation!</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Of course! Right! Good one, Squints! Access
the situation! Okay!</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Um, Squints? How do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: First we survey the enemy’s environment,
then we make note of the surrounding terrain.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: What?…</p>
<p>****: I heard that on “Combat.” Let’s just look out the window.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: He’s darin’ us!</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: He’s darin’ us!</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: He’s waitin’ for us, man. Just like he did
with The Toad.</p>
<p>****: Poor Toad.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: We’re on his territory now.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Think he’s pissed?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Is Doby Gillis a dork? Anybody got any bright
ideas?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: We had absolutely no idea what the hell we
were gonna do. So things started primitively.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: It ain’t mine. I told you, it’s my little
sister’s!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: A-okay. Roger, affirmative. Initiate
retreival suction.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: We have suction! Pull it up! PULL IT</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: We’ve been going about this all wrong. I
blame myself. We need total surprise.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Therefore, we tunnel. The Beast will never
expect it.</p>
<p>****: I got it! I got it!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: It’s huge - oh, my God! It’s huge - pull
him out! It’s huge! PULL HIM</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: It’s huge - pull him out! Oh God, it’s
like a dinosaur! Wh - Wh - Where am I?!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Yeah-Yeah! Get hold of yourself! What’d you
see?!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Oh-oh, it was like hugeness and darkness
and like the world was ending and the devil came up through the ground
and the - and the - and the -</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: - somebody slap him quick! We’re losin’
him!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Thanks. I needed that.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, I know - I’m lightest. But I
ain’t goin’ over there! NO WAY!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Sorry, Smalls. It was a good idea anyway.</p>
<p><strong>denunez</strong>: Yeah, tough luck, Smalls.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: It won’t be that bad, Smalls. Your dad’ll
probably only shoot you or something.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Hey-hey, don’t blame me! I didn’t hit the
ball over there, man!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, okay. But if I say pull me up,
you guys better PULL ME UP!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Here. Put these on.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Wha -? Why? Whadda I need All this stuff
for Benny? I mean, why a mask and a gonad Protector?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Oh, ah, nuthin’, ya know, just For, ah…
Altitude leveling And stuff. Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Don’t worry. We’re professionals.</p>
<p><strong>repeat</strong>: Our Dad’s a contractor.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Okay-okay, I’m right over it. Let me down
- slow!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Ahhhh! Stop! STOP!</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: ‘Kay-’kay, tip me, hurry up. I’m gettin’
the woollies.</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Okay get me outta here!</p>
<p>****: H - h - help! Help! HELP-HELP- HELP!</p>
<p>****: Hail Mary Father who art star light twinkle twinkle hey diddle
diddle -</p>
<p><strong>yeah-yeah</strong>: Yeah-yeah, I did it! SO WHAT?! You jerks,
I told you to pull me back faster! You - you penises.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Yeah-Yeah grew two feet in our eyes after
that. There was no stinkin’ way any of us would’ve showed back up, if
we’d loaded our drawers.</p>
<p>****: Yeah-Yeah did. He showed back up and got right to work, like
nothing ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>int. tree house - day</strong>: 158</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I think I know how to get it. Anybody got an
Erector Set?</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: That thing with the nuts and bolts and tiny
wrenches that you can build junk out of?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>ham</strong>: I used to have one when I was like I dunno, a
little kid.</p>
<p>****: Might have some pieces. Gee, I don’t think so. I’d have to
look. Maybe in the attic. Not in our room though.</p>
<p><strong>gang</strong>: Guess I had more than I thought. Forgot my
grandma got me some for my birthday. It’s my little brother’s.</p>
<p><strong>bertram</strong>: Bitchin’.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I really like Erector Set.</p>
<p>****: Me too. I was just thinkin’ the same thing. Couldn’t agree
more, Smalls. I play with mine all the time.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Let’s get to work. Here’s the plans -</p>
<p>****: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I got it! I got it!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My life was over. Just as Bill had finally
warmed up to me, and asked me to be the man of the house, I had to knock
a priceless chunk of history into the clutches of a monster. Great.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: We can’t get it back, Babe.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: M - M - Mom?…</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Who’s there?!</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Now don’t go peeing your pants or nuthin’,
I’m just here to give ya a hand.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: B - B - But, you’re…</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: …dead? Legends never die, kid.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You’re really him. You’re The Babe. The
Sultan of Swat. The King -</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: - of Krash and a hundred other dopey
names. Forget about that, we ain’t got much time. I’m here ’cause you’re
in some kinda pickle, right?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: A baseball with my John Hancock on it went
over a fence, and you can’t get it back. Right?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Then just hop over there and get it. There
ya go. Problem solved. See ya, kid.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Wait! I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Can’t what?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Go into that backyard.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: There’s a Beast back there.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one kid
already.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Everybody gets one chance to do something
great. Most people either never take the chance ’cause they’re too
scared, or they don’t recognize it when it spits on their shoes.</p>
<p>****: This is your “big chance,” and ya shouldn’t let it go by.</p>
<p>****: Remember those cards you got the other day?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in the same
pack.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: What’re the odds on that?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: About a zillion to one.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: More even. Someone’s tellin’ you
somethin’, kid. And if I was you… I’d listen.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah, but what?</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: You’re the one with the rubba legs. Figure
it out.</p>
<p>****: You gotta do what your heart tells you, else you’ll spend the
rest of your life wishin’ you had.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You mean, I should hop that fence - and
pickle with THE BEAST?!</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Lemme tell you something… you remember
that called shot homer I hit?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Sure, the greatest most famous and legendary
home run of all time.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Yeah, right, well said.</p>
<p>****: Well, you think I knew I was gonna swat that?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Sure ya did, Babe.</p>
<p><strong>the babe</strong>: Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the way
down to first I kept sayin’ to myself, “you lucky bum.”</p>
<p>****: Think about that, kid. I’ll see ya later.</p>
<p><strong>the babe’s voice</strong>: Remember, kid. There’s heroes and
there’s Legends. Heroes get remembered… but Legends never die.</p>
<p>****: Follow your heart, kid, and you’ll never go wrong.</p>
<p>****: I had a dream. Get dressed. We’re goin’ to the sandlot.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Benny - wait. It’s okay, it was my fault.
I’ll just take whatever I get. You don’t have to do this.</p>
<p>****: Yeah I do, Smalls. I have to.</p>
<p><strong>the babe’s voice</strong>: …Follow your heart, kid, and
you’ll never go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: What’re we waitin’ for?! Let’s go after
’em!</p>
<p>****: Mommy, mommy - wook! Ah, ah - goggy!</p>
<p>****: Big goggy.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Sandlot!</p>
<p><strong>squints</strong>: This way! Shortcut!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Oh noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Help him! I’m stuck! I’m stuck! Help
him!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him
off!</p>
<p>****: Easy. Easy, boy.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: We can play forever now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: Hello?…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Um, we brought your dog home.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: Hercules? How’d he get out?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Well, sir… um, we kind of, well, what
happened was -</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: - we hit a baseball into your yard. Then we
tried to get it and -</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: - why didn’t you just come to the door…
I’d have gotten it for you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: Well, thanks for bringin’ him back.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you boys come in… we can talk about baseball.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You knew Babe Ruth?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: Yeah. And he knew me too.</p>
<p>****: They never let us play together, but we were friends. Good
friends. He was almost as great a hitter as I was. But, he’d of told you
he was better.</p>
<p>****: This the one that went over my fence?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: This is an old ball, boys. Really
old.</p>
<p>****: Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn’t he?</p>
<p>****: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: You sound upset, son - what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Well, you see… that ball belongs to my
stepdad… and, uh - it was signed by Babe Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: Hmm. Well, I’m sure your dad will
understand.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p>****: Son, move Maury Wills to second base for me, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: If he steals third that’ll be number
100.</p>
<p>****: Helluva pickle you’re in, boy.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>mr. mertle</strong>: I’ll make you a deal. If you boys come
over once a week and talk baseball with me, I’ll trade you balls.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Well, that’s really nice of you… but this
ball really is signed by The Babe.</p>
<p>****: This one really is too… and all the rest of the ’27
Yankees.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Oh my God - Murderers’ Row.</p>
<p>****: Lou Gehrig…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Babe Ruth.</p>
<p>****: They’re all there.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This better be good.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth was
like the Hercules of baseball, and then The Beast’s name turned out to
be Hercules.</p>
<p>****: It was also strange that Mr. Mertle had a Murderers’ Row ball
to replace the one signed by The Babe.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Some people might say that it was all a
coincidence… but looking back at it now, it seems like everything was
connected, just like me and Benny.</p>
<p>****: It was like we were a part of the same myth as The Babe… the
Myth of Baseball.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Guys, supper’s ready.</p>
<p>****: Give us another ten minutes. I’m helpin’ my boy break in his
new glove.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: That was the last summer that we all got
to play together.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But it would stay with us forever.
Yeah-Yeah’s parents shipped him off to military school. Timmy and Tommy
grew up to build skyscrapers. Ham went to college and became a
pediatrician. DeNunez played triple A ball and never got to the majors.
Bertram got really into the sixities and no one ever saw him again.
Squints grew up and married Wendy Peffercorn; they bought the Five &amp;
Dime and they still own it to this day. Hercules lived to be 199 years
old… in human years.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: After Benny pickled the Beast, his
reputation spread all over town. From then on he was known as Benny “The
Juet” Rodriguez.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The nickname stuck with him the rest of
his life.</p>
<p>****: That’s a triple, and that’ll put the winning run on third, with
two out in the bottom of the ninth. What a shot!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Lasorda’s sending in a pinch runner - and
it’ll be…</p>
<p>****: I don’t believe it! Lasorda’s calling up the “Old Man” to
pinch-run in the biggest clutch situation this season! They say the
veteran’s lost a step or two. But if I were you, I’d get ready for some
fireworks.</p>
<p>****: Give ’em hell, Jet.</p>
<p><strong>the jet</strong>: I’ll do my best, Maury.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The Dodgers win the pennant! The Dodgers
win the pennant!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: I don’t believe it, the Old Man stole
home! The Old Man -</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: The Jet stole home! The Jet stole home!!</p>
