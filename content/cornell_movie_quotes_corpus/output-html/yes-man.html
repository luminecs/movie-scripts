<p><strong>kath</strong>: You don’t do anything more. You used to be
fun. Now you hardly ever even leave your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m here, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: That’s because it’s New Year’s Eve. You have
to be here. Besides, it’s not only social stuff. You used to have
dreams. You wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the
World Bank.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So I discovered b-school’s not for me. People
grow.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Growing is “X is not for me so I’ll do Y.” You
went X is not for me and so I guess I’ll sit on the couch for the rest
of my life.</p>
<p>****: Well, look, this sucks, but I understand where you’re coming
from.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: This is the problem. You don’t even care that
I’m breaking up with you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Of course I care. But I also understand.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: You shouldn’t just understand. You should be
mad. Or upset. Or sad. Or something.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We’re at different places in our lives. I get
it.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Your girlfriend of two years breaks up with
you right before New Year’s Eve and all you can say is “I get it?” It is
completely within your right to call me a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That would be inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: I can’t believe I’ve been dating someone so
emotionless.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: C’mere. It’ll be OK.</p>
<p><strong>patrons</strong>: Three, two, one… happy New Year!</p>
<p>****: Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, that was fantastic. Good night,
guys.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re going, already?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: We haven’t even finished the song yet.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I saw the ball drop and hugged all of you.
Aliens didn’t invade. Our computers are still working. What else could
possibly happen?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Rooney might throw up.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: It’s true. I’m very close.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I see that happen like every night. Good night
and Happy New Year.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: How did he take the break-up?</p>
<p>****: Like a robot. Two years, and nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Wanna rock out tonight?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t rock out.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: Would you like an
Italian-inspired coffee flavoring?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: How about the double doughnut
special?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Dear Trusted Foreigner, Allow me to introduce
myself. I am the deposed King of Nigeria and I wish to propose a
confidential transaction. Allow me to delete you, my liege.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: My teller reporting for duty.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m not a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You’re a soldier on the front line of
finance.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m out of town.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: Hey, I need to speak to a loan
specialist and there’s no one on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sorry. Today I’m officially a greeter.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: But there’s no one around.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Someone might come. And if I’m not here, they
won’t be greeted.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: You’re really not going to help
me?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Until I’m relieved as a greeter, my hands are
tied.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Hey, there. I’m Chris Parker. The new
president of Southwest Bank. Just wanted to come by and personally
introduce myself to every branch manager.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: That would be me. Norman Calhoun.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m Carl Kendall. Just a teller.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I was “just a teller.” And now I’m
“just president of the largest bank in the Southwest.” You need
anything, you let corporate know. You hear?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, if you’re into fake breasts and German
engineering.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Check and check.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: Can you help me now?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, but this gentleman can.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Think about my party, Carl!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Will do!</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: Would you like an Italian
–</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: How about –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Valentine party. Just wear something
red!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Can’t.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Dress as your favorite animal –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: – historical figure –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No can do.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Carl. It’s Peter. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m in bed. Why? What happened? Did someone
die?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. It’s just – we’re at Rudy’s. Celebrating
New Year’s.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s already 11:15. I don’t think I can make
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, c’mon, Carl. No one’s seen you for like
forever. Please swing by?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Carl Kendall?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Alex Eberts? What’s up, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Too much! How’ve you been? I can’t believe
you’re still working here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where’ve you been? Norman’s been heartbroken
since you quit.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Where’ve I been? You mean, where haven’t I
been? This year. Dude. I have lived. I climbed Mt. Kilmanjaro. I ate bat
in Laos. I shot a cow with a bazooka. I’m not proud of that last one but
I did it. How’s the bank?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Same old same old.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: See? That’s the problem. That’s everyone’s
problem. You’ve got one life. Why waste it on the same old same old?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You kidding? Every day it’s impossible not to
throw rocks at the place.</p>
<p>****: Since you don’t work here anymore, you want to throw a
couple?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What’re you doing! Stop that! I was
kidding!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What do you think you’re doing? Alex Eberts!
Is this an alumnae prank? I love pranks!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, Norman!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: We have a situation.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Go to the seminar, Carl! You won’t be
sorry!</p>
<p>****: Carl, it’s Peter. I know you don’t do things anymore, but it’d
mean a lot if you’d come by Rudy’s tonight. Lucy and I are celebrating
our engagement.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is an intervention. You’ve missed your
last event.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Our engagement party.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m just really busy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re watching Hell’s Kitchen. That’s not
even B-list reality TV.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So I don’t want to go out tonight. Maybe I
have to wake up early tomorrow. You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s bigger than that. You and Kath broke up
over a year ago and you still aren’t dating anyone.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What? So? I’m like a sexual camel. I only need
it once every couple years.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t mean to be harsh but everyone’s
moving forward. It’s like you’re still wearing a Timex while the rest of
us each have entry level Rolexes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You wear a Rolex?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks for noticing. It’s an Oyster Perpetual
Yachtmaster. Sapphire crystal, self-winding. Four Gs. But that’s not the
point I’m trying to make.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So I don’t have an oyster watch. All you and
Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and
Barrel.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s wrong with Crate and Barrel? They have
adorable stuff at reasonable prices.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Forget Crate and Barrel. Maybe I’m just
getting more mature. I don’t need the lifestyle ever night.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lifestyle? You have to have a life to have a
style of life. You never leave your apartment. You never meet anyone
new.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I hate meeting people.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ve become a complete cave dweller.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I am not a cave dweller. Just the other day,
we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I wouldn’t
steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish
hillbilly band. That’s not very cave dweller of me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just the other day? That was seven years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But that’s not possible – I was already
working at the bank by then.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You had started there three years earlier.
Why you’ve worked at that place for so long is beyond me. You had so
much potential. You shouldn’t be a teller. You should be the guy who
tells the guy who tells the teller what to do.</p>
<p>****: I’ve been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years? How the
hell did that happen? Ten years… if I had had a child, he’d be
toilet-trained by now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Actually, he’d be in fourth grade.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I was making out with chicks by fourth grade.
I was a little man by fourth grade.</p>
<p>****: Whatever. I don’t need this shit right now. I’m an adult man. I
can live my life as I see fit. Can you please leave?</p>
<p><strong>wiry, crunchy woman</strong>: Is this your first time at one
of Sanji’s lectures?</p>
<p>****: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>****: Have you been to this before?</p>
<p><strong>wiry, crunchy woman</strong>: Only like fifty-eight times.
Sanji’s a genius. Like seriously… he will blow your mind all over the
goddamn room. He’s like a mind grenade.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t know if I want that.</p>
<p><strong>wiry, crunchy woman</strong>: Oh you do not. But you need it.
And that’s why you are here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Cool. Do you want anything from the
refreshment area?</p>
<p><strong>wiry, crunchy woman</strong>: You kidding? That processed
shit will kill you faster than a pleasure cruise to Chernobyl.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Life. We are all living it.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: I am sorry, my friends. But I cannot hear
you?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Shhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>wiry, crunchy woman</strong>: He is!</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Come on up, Future Yes Man!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s OK. I’m just auditing.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: You can’t audit life! Now get on up here!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m cool right here.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Then I will come to you!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Carl.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Let me guess, Carl. This was not your idea to
come here, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I wouldn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: You can tell me, Carl. We are all alone,
Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It wasn’t exactly my idea.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: That’s what I thought, Carl. And you think
this is all bullshit, Carl, isn’t that right, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Honestly?</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Is there any other way?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This whole thing seems retarded.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: But you are stuck in your life, Carl? Am I
right?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I wouldn’t necessarily –</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: You once had a dream? You wanted to own a
boat? A house? A fancy car? You wanted to a doctor, a lawyer… a business
man?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: It’s odd that ten years can pass just like
that.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: I want you to do something for me, Carl.
Tomorrow, I want you only to say yes. Can you do that for me? For one
day, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m not sure –</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Please, Carl. Do it for me and you will be
doing it for yourself. If you don’t have the best day in ten years then
I am the uncle of a monkey. Will you do it for me Carl? Just for a
day?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Welcome to the world of yes!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yello.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Carl, it’s Peter. I just wanted to apologize
about barging in yesterday. You were right. It’s your life to live.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Me, Lucy and Kath are all going out for
brunch. You have any interest in joining?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, thanks for the invite, but…</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Will you do it for me Carl? Just for a
day?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes. I will come to brunch.</p>
<p>****: Morning, Carl. This is a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Because I’ve never seen you at brunch. Like
ever.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You kidding? I love brunch.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why do people wait an hour for breakfast? It’s
so hot and bright and we haven’t even had coffee yet.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you don’t want to be here, you don’t have
to be.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Of course I want to be here. I love waiting an
hour for eggs. It’s fun. Although I will point out that you have
sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oakleys, polarized lenses, indestructible.
Two fifty but worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Lowell, party of five.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We were definitely before those Lowell
people.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: I hate when people jump ahead.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why does no one ever say anything?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you want to be sitting so bad, why don’t
you say something?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes. I will.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: No you weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes, we were.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I have the list, dude. The list doesn’t
lie.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, this time the list lied.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It’s OK, Carl. It’s just brunch.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You all know that we were up before you! And
you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s going on with you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just want transparency in terms of the
brunch seating order.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Great. Now we’re going to get into a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>brunch dude</strong>: We talked about what you said… you’re
right. You guys were here before us. Sorry we didn’t pipe up sooner. We
cool, brother?</p>
<p>****: Yeah. We cool.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It’s a two bedroom duplex with harbor views.
It’d be perfect for you Kath.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Washer/Dryer in the building?</p>
<p>****: I didn’t realize you were looking to buy a place. I thought you
and I would be renters to the end.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She’s a fancy lawyer making bank. It’s about
time she was buying.</p>
<p>****: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’re you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Bacon and eggs.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: How unadventurous.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t want an adventure first thing in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I just want to tell you about my specials.
We have a double fruit burnt sugar waffle. Any of you interested in
that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Alrighty. Then, on the savory side, we
have a smoked whitefish omelet with hash browns on the side. Any
takers?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: You want both?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Would you like toast with that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Any side? Bacon.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sausage.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Turkey sausage?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: A side of our famous maple pancakes –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Wow. Someone’s really hungry.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Coffee or juice?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Coffee. And juice.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: We also have smoothies?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p>****: What would you all like to order?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Would you like some pepper?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Would you like more?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever seen a waiter tap one
of those pepper mills.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m just addicted to the stuff. Chinese
cultures say it’s good for digestion.</p>
<p>****: You’re all welcome to have some.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: That’s… OK. Do you want a bite of mine?</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Because you ordered a latte.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hey, Carl. We’re a little short on our
Saturday staff. I know this is going against ten years of precedent, but
you have any interest in coming in today?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t think… there’s any reason why I
shouldn’t? On a Saturday there’s nothing I like more than the inside of
a bank.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: There really is something magical about this
place.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: Would you like an
Italian-inspired coffee flavoring?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: Sugar, Splenda or
Nutrasweet?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: All of them please.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: We’re having a special on
Munchkins?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Want a flier? Oh, it’s you. Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Of course I’ll take a flier.</p>
<p>****: The Flying Buttresses.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I knew after a year and a half of wearing you
down, you’d give in. I’m Renee by the way.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Carl.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Carl. Cool. I like to thank everyone
personally who comes to our performances. It gives it a nice intimate
touch. See you soon Carl.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Morning, Carl. Thanks for coming in and
being part of the Saturday banking experience. Oooh, Munchkins. Are
those for the office, you dirty devil?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah. I just though it would be a fun way to
lighten things up.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You didn’t approve this with petty cash.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I spent my own money on them…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Kidding! Munchkins are always approved.
Although, I can’t reimburse you. Today is free Munchkin day. That’s
right! Free Munchkin day!</p>
<p><strong>bank employees</strong>: Carl rules./You’re the best./Finally
I have a reason to live today.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: I need to speak to a loan
specialist.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: While loans aren’t normally in my
jurisdiction, I’d be happy to help you.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: I want to refi my house and spend the
capital on my personal business. I see you’ve got a 5.25 7 year ARM, but
over at Chase they’re offering 5.00 7 year ARM. Can you refi lower, like
at 4.85 par example, or am I going to have to bring my beeswax
elsewhere?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: Yes? That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yup. What’s your business?</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: Selling beanie babies online.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Adorable.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: More like highly profitable. I’ve
crunched the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Let me just get final approval on this.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You’re a teller, not a loan specialist.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, I know, so if you think this is a bad idea
for a loan that’s fine but can you please tell her yourself?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Her business plan.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Inta-maresting. My grandma loves beanie
babies. Although unfortunately, we have a minimum loan floor of ten
thousand dollars. She only wants five.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s silly. How’re you supposed to start a
tiny business if you can’t get a tiny business loan?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t make the rules, I just break
`em.</p>
<p>****: I don’t break them. I just wanted to rhyme. If she wants us to
loan her ten thousand or more, great. Otherwise, I think her only option
is a loan shark.</p>
<p>****: So, what’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Do you maybe have any interest in borrowing
ten thousand?</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: I can’t afford the payments on ten.
You can’t do five thousand? This is the fifth bank I’ve been to.
Please?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Of course we can. One moment please.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oooh, thank you. Feed the addiction, am I
right?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s approved.</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: Thank you so much! I promise I won’t
let you down, Mr. Kendall. On me.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thanks, Marge. We don’t like to make other
customers jealous so can we keep this between you and I?</p>
<p><strong>bank customer</strong>: Of course. Aren’t you just a
dear?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Carl, could I see you for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Earlier today, you showed some initiative.
And I loved it. What do you say to a permanent spot at the loan
desk?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That seems like a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: We need a loan specialist a lot more than we
need a teller and greeter. Besides, you’d have a starting salary of
52.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Grand?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No, dollars. What is this Darfur? Sorry,
Patricia, that was inappropriate. Of course grand. To celebrate, next
Saturday, I’m throwing a party. Dress up as your favorite character from
Heroes.</p>
<p>****: Save the cheerleader, save the world.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Next Saturday… sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Don’t dress as Hiro. I got dibs.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wouldn’t think of it.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Carl Kendall? Out in the world? Are you some
kind of ghost? Am I having a religious vision?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Believe it. Because this guy just got a
promotion.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Congrats, Carl!</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Well let’s get you a beer. You want a 20
ouncer? I’m just joking - -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A normal-sized beer is fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I think I’m done actually.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Two twenty ouncers and one tiny, little
beer, barkeep.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Please don’t call me that. We’re not in
the middle ages.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I can’t believe you’re out here. I’m giddy.
I feel like a child whose best friend has strict Chinese parents who
never let him come out and play but now his Chinese parents are away for
the Chinese New Year. You have any interest in pounding this shit?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: What do you say we have another?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: You are a beast!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, it’s been fun watching you guys recreate
freshman year, but Peter and I have some furniture errands to run.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Have a good day yuppifying your lives.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We need a sofa, Carl. We’re not buying a
second home.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Whatever, yuppy sellouts.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It was good seeing you. You should come out
more often.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Please don’t leave me here with him.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I have not been this drunk in years! The room
is spinning in a bad way!</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Barkeep! Two more double pints s’il vous
plait!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That was the last `barkeep.’ I am cutting
you off.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Well fortunately you’re not the only game in
town! Let’s go to some place with class.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where’s the class?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: They wear uniforms here.</p>
<p><strong>senor frog’s waitress</strong>: Jello shot?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I am hot.</p>
<p><strong>senor frog’s waitress</strong>: Another jello shot?</p>
<p><strong>carl rooney</strong>: Yes. I think I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>senor frog’s dj</strong>: Senor Frog’s famous karoake contest
is starting now! Sign up and sweep us off our feet!</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: You gotta do karoake.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sign me up, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>senor frog’s dj</strong>: We’ve got our first victim… I mean,
singer.</p>
<p><strong>music cue</strong>: The opening notes of White Town’s “Your
Woman”</p>
<p>****: As you read this part, I recommend listening to White Town’s
“Your Woman.” It will bring it to life in a</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just tell me what you’ve got to say to me,
I’ve been waiting for so long to hear the truth, It comes as no surprise
at all you see, So cut the crap and tell me that we’re through. Now I
know your heart, I know your mind, You don’t even know you’re being
unkind, So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways, Just use me up and
then you walk away, Boy you can’t play me that way.</p>
<p><strong>brutish boyfriend</strong>: Were you just flirting with my
girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It depends – is that your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>brutish boyfriend</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Then yes.</p>
<p><strong>hot girl</strong>: Hey, c’mon. Be cool. He was just screwing
around.</p>
<p><strong>brutish boyfriend</strong>: Let me handle this, Crystal. So,
you want to have sex with my girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes, I do. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>brutish boyfriend</strong>: Are you starting a fight?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: C’mon, Carl, let’s go –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>brutish boyfriend</strong>: Then bring it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>brutish boyfriend</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Me bringing it.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: You popped that guy! He didn’t know what hit
him.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You do not cross Carl Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>hot girl</strong>: Hey. I’m sorry about Domingo. He likes to
think he’s my boyfriend but he’s not. You’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hot girl</strong>: My fiance called. He was like really sorry
about last night. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Your fiance?</p>
<p><strong>hot girl</strong>: Domingo. The guy who punched you in the
face.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I thought you said you two weren’t even
dating?</p>
<p><strong>hot girl</strong>: We were broken up last night. It was fun
hanging out.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hi… is there a Sanji Gupta staying here?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Room 125.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m Carl. The guy from yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Of course, of course! Please come in!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No thanks. I just wanted to thank you for that
inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Fantastic. So how do you plan on continuing
with your journey?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You know, just living every day to it’s
fullest. And, like, learning to continue to experience life or
whatever.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Outstanding, Carl. Except for one</p>
<p><strong>thing:</strong>: You are completely bullshitting me!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just said I’m going to keep experiencing
life. I thought you’d be happy.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: You’re like a cigarette addict, Carl. Except
you’re addicted to boredom. On the way in here, Carl, I offered you a
coffee and you refused. Perhaps that would have been the most delicious
cup of coffee you would have ever had. Who’s to say? Not you, Carl,
because you said no! Anyone can quit smoking for a day. But for a
lifetime? No.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So what should I do?</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Behold, Carl, – the Maniyesto.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Until New Year’s Eve, I must say The yes
cannot distort the truth.</p>
<p>****: You cannot say “Yes, the world is flat” because that is an
untruth.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: If someone discovers you are a yes man, you do
not have to say yes To avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact. Therefore,
you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your
email, etc and so on and so forth. You must choose a yesponsor to keep
you on the straight and narrow. Who should that be?</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: A close friend who will not tell a soul.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I hereby void the “do you want” loophole. What
is that?</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: If someone asks you “do you want to go to the
art museum” and you do not want to, you may not use this lack of desire
as an excuse to not go. And finally, a warning.</p>
<p>****: If you say `no’, even once, even for a cup of coffee, be
prepared to lose every single little thing you’ve gained.</p>
<p>****: So what do you say, Carl?</p>
<p>****: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I say… yes.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: And here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Is this like a legal document?</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Kind of. And finally, my friend, please hold
out your hand.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: That should heal by New Year’s. Until then,
you are a Yes Man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For a whole year?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yesterday I got promoted and beat up and
hooked up with this chick and I have a massive headache today and I
still might throw up, but I don’t care because it was the best time I’ve
had in like forever. Not to mention finding out that, despite what you
might think, smoked whitefish in an omelette is delicious, even if
covered in a thick layer of pepper.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But for a whole year?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You don’t understand. I got promoted. Do you
know how long I’ve been waiting for some kind of financial step forward?
I said `yes’ and it arrived.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, someone sounds like they’re yuppifying
their life.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Excuse me for wanting an appliance in my
kitchen besides a hot pot.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s no way you can do this for a whole
year.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s where you come in. You’re my
“Yesponsor.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yesponsor?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Like in AA. I need you to hold me to it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You aren’t going to last for more than a
week.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I look forward to proving you wrong.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Cavalli. Silk and cotton blend. Seven
fifty.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: My girlfriends are being such bitches. It’s
been two weeks and no one’s offered to throw me a wedding shower.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s too bad. I’m sure someone will
offer.</p>
<p>****: Hey, you want to throw my wedding shower?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’d be happy to.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I was kidding. Wedding showers are thrown by
girls.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s sexist. Please. I insist.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Thanks. That means a lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: That was some good times last night. You
back for more?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I’ve got no cash. You mind spotting me and
my buddies?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry, didn’t bring my wallet.</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rooney’s friends/rooney</strong>: As long as you’re buying, I
want a Grey Goose straight up./Kir Royale/Whatever’s in that dusty
bottle back there that you never take down.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Black coffee, large.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: Would you like…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: To have a wonderful day? I would.</p>
<p>****: And could I also have a Mocha Caramel Coolata.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: With whipped cream?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Hey, give that back. You already took
one.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What’s the hurt in taking another?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Destroys the Earth. Also, they cost me ten
cents a copy. Besides, are you even going to come?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Of course. I couldn’t say `no.’</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: See you tonight, Carl!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Dear deposed King of Nigeria. I would love to
help you anyway I can with your confidential transaction. Please let me
know what I can do. Yours, Carl Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>high school girl</strong>: You Carl Kendall?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>high school girl</strong>: I hear that you do small
loans.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>high school girl</strong>: Marge. The lady my mom buys her
beanie babies from.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I told her not to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>high school girl</strong>: I only need five hundred bucks.
I’m starting college next year and I need it for books. I can’t afford
them now but I can pay them off over the course of the year.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I might have some stuff to pawn./I will
definitely check out your gun selection./I would like to learn
Korean.</p>
<p><strong>berlitz flier guy</strong>: If you’re interested, intro to
Korean is starting right now.</p>
<p>****:</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Hello Jake, Penelope, Carl and Rodrigo. We
are the Flying Buttresses!</p>
<p>****: Everyday, the unicorns they play/Among lingonberry fields/They
silently bay/The king has no crown/Just a vest of grass/The queen loves
the Jester/The Jester has the last laugh.</p>
<p>****: You are my minotaur/With your cloven hooves!/Half man, half
horse/You are all boy to me</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Nice, show Renee. One virgin mint soda
coming right up.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I don’t think I hit a high enough octave in
Fairy Dream Song.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I disagree. I think you hit some pretty high
octaves.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: But I can hit like way higher. Like check
this out. I think this tone might be more appropriate for my water nymph
song?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t know – I’ve known some water nymphs
with big balls. From the high level of testosterone.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I’ve got to write a song about that. I could
call it…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: “Big Balled Water Nymph”? It’s a working
title.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I like it. I can work with that.</p>
<p><strong>leeore</strong>: Um, excuse me, but we have to clear the
stage.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I gotta clear.</p>
<p>****: Unless of course, you want to help?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sure. I love clearing stages.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Well, thanks for coming, Carl. I must bid
good night.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So early? It’s only 8:00?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I lead a jogging, photo group for people who
want to both exercise and practice photography.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re a photographer too?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Amateur, but yeah. I show every Friday.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What time do you leave?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Five. So we can see the sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wow. I haven’t seen the sunrise maybe
ever.</p>
<p>****: I guess now I’ll be doing that tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Oh, it’s beautiful. Makes great photos. Nice
meeting you, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>flier guy</strong>: You interested in learning Spanish?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Thinking of learning a couple foreign
languages?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, Kath. Would you like one? I’m going to
learn Swahili.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Maybe next week. There’s someone you should
probably meet. Carl, this is Seb.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Seb? What is that? Swedish?</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re on a date then?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: Yeah. Met him at my firm.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: He’s very tall.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: I guess so, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb. So I’ll be
going.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Unless… you’d like to join us?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’d love to. Join you guys.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So, how did you guys meet?</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: I told you. Through the firm.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Would you like to order some wine?</p>
<p><strong>kath/carl/seb</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, this is good.</p>
<p>****: I was walking past Pizza Hut the other day, and for a second I
was sure the sign said “Pizza Hat.” And then I thought, wouldn’t it be
funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas? You know.
Because it sounds like “Pizza Hut” only it’s a hat shop.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Look, Carl, why don’t you just eat your fish
and fuck off?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: What’s up Carl? It’s Rooney! What do you say
we grab a couple brewskis?</p>
<p><strong>nigerian king</strong>: Dear brother Carl, Thank you for your
last note you sent me. But we must move quickly. I must have your bank
details right now. Send them to me. Your Associate, Omar, King of
Nigeria</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Dear Omar, While I appreciate the gravity of
your situation, perhaps a goodwill branch is in order. Could you perhaps
loan me a million and take it out of my final cut? Then I will happily
send you my bank details. Sincerely, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>persian cartoon genie</strong>: Sa’laam, Carl. You have
sixty-five winks. Allah Akbar.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Wow. You look tired.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, it is five in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Mammals are meant to be up at dawn. It’s how
we’re built biologically. Where’s your camera?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I thought I’d use my phone.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Awesome idea. So light.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Let’s hit it.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Alright! Enough standing around!</p>
<p><strong>iranian woman</strong>: It was delightful meeting you,
Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: As it was meeting you Farinoush.</p>
<p><strong>iranian woman</strong>: Although I must say I was surprised
to discover that you are in no way Persian. Nor are you six foot two.
You should change that on your profile.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Will do. Should I call you?</p>
<p><strong>iranian woman</strong>: Sorry, I want a tall guy.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Farinoush Azzam. Great girl, but I don’t think
we’re right for each other.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: How’d you meet?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: PersianWifeFinder.com. Let’s talk wedding
shower.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: So, I know it’s just a wedding shower, so who
cares really? And it’s like so lame? But I’ve made an appointment at a
stationery store. Are you going to totally kill me?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You kidding? I love stationery.</p>
<p><strong>stationery proprietess</strong>: This one is nice. I
especially love it in cream.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Ooooh, pretty. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Looks good to me.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Thanks for your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>stationery proprietess</strong>: It’s always difficult to get
the husband-to-be’s opinion.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m not marrying him.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m just helping throw the shower.</p>
<p><strong>stationery proprietess</strong>: Oh. What’s the party going
to be like? Sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an
invitation.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Nothing special. Just hors d’oeuvres and
wine.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Look at this – Bridal Bingo. What’s Bridal
Bingo?</p>
<p><strong>stationery proprietess</strong>: It’s bingo, except you yell
out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card
first wins.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That sounds fun.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m not doing Bridal Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How about a calendar shower?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Can we concentrate at the task at hand?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Do you even know what a calendar shower is?
Maybe a calendar shower is awesome.</p>
<p><strong>stationery proprietess</strong>: Every guest gets assigned a
month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that
month.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: That’s kind of cute.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I think that’s really cute.</p>
<p><strong>stationery proprietess</strong>: The bride and groom ride in
on a white stallion.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You have got to do that. Like it’s not even a
choice.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: That seems a little extreme.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You only get married once.</p>
<p><strong>stationery proprietess</strong>: Your friend happens to be
right.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’re really good at this. You mind helping
me with the wedding invitations?</p>
<p><strong>arab guy</strong>: I love cell phones. I breathe cell phones.
I own, myself, thirty-five cell phones. My brother is an idiot and he’s
selling cell phones hand over fist. What do you have? A Nokia 9850?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How much do you need?</p>
<p><strong>arab guy</strong>: Eighty five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>ten year old girl</strong>: I was with my sister? And we had
this lemonade stand? And we sold like a hundred cups of lemonade in two
days? And so I want to expand?</p>
<p><strong>jittery guy</strong>: Just give me the cash.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You promise you’ll pay it back?</p>
<p><strong>jittery guy</strong>: Basically.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: May I speak to you, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You’re loaning below our minimum.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry, but it’s absurd that if you need a
small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark. Only rich people
can pay back loans over ten grand. A bank’s job is not to just help the
rich. It’s to help anyone with a dream achieve it.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I know. These microloans are pretty
interesting. So I’ll you spearhead a little pilot program at the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: If corporate finds out, you’re the one who’s
getting fired. So keep it quiet.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What do you need a loan for?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I don’t. I was wondering if you were around
tonight to help me move?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why don’t you hire movers?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Because it’s cheaper to ask you.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Can you carry the fridge alone?</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes. Do you want to help at all?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I wish I could, but I hurt my back trying to
move that fridge.</p>
<p><strong>rooney’s mom</strong>: I’m going to miss you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: And I’m going to miss you, ma.</p>
<p><strong>rooney’s mom</strong>: I can’t watch you go.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where are you moving?</p>
<p><strong>music cue</strong>: “JUMP” by the Pointer Sisters</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: We need a volunteer to think up local
marketing ideas</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: We need someone to be a weekend cashier.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Do you want to change your life through
Mahayana Buddhism?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m kind of in a rush…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: My place is right around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It is only through the four noble truths and
the destruction of desire that we can end suffering.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, that’s really neat. So, thanks for the
books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry, but I have to go –</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Do you like Dionne Warwick?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It was really great meeting you –</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: C’mon, Carl. Shake your groove thang.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I really have to go.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Want to go into my bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Do you have any candles? I just love
candles.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How about wine? Like a bottle of
Beaujolais?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I only have Beaujolais Nouveau.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I have herpes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Upstairs or downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Front door or back door?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s a swinging door!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Just give it!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s with the kitten?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just adopted her. If you’re interested,
they’re giving them away in front of Petco.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t want a kitten.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Neither did I.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s secretary</strong>: Andy Solomon on line two.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, asshole, we’re not talking until you
sign that goddamn contract.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Seems like a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She was upset you went on her date.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: He asked me to join them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think you’re taking this too far.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I have no choice. I’m a yes man. I must say
yes. If Seb asks me to join them on their date, I must. If some dude
asks me for a loan I have to give it to them even if it’s clearly never
going to be paid back. If a guy asks me into his bedroom, I must hook up
with him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You hooked up with a dude?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s like hooking up with a strong woman. I
honestly don’t see what the big deal is. I am guided by yes. Yes has
become my superpower. And let me tell, yes is turning out to be a pretty
sweet deal. Now if you’ll excuse me I’m late for Korean class.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You hate Korean food.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s no reason to write off an entire,
vibrant culture. See you later, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You really are displaying that.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: That’s probably my best photo ever. My
collages aren’t bad. But personally, I think I excel at pottery.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wow. That’s really big. How do you have time
for all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: How do you have time to come to every one of
my rocks shows even the one in Fairfield county that was seventy-five
miles from here? I almost skipped that one.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You gave me the flier, so I had to go.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: At first I thought you were a weird stalker
and I was scared. But now I think you’re just a really shy dude with a
crush. And while it’s been suspenseful to see when/if you’d ask me out
–</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Do you want to go out sometime?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yes, I would.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: By the way, I do other stuff besides follow
you around.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I take Korean.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: In that case, what do you say we do
Korean?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Do you want any more squid hot pot? It’s
really good here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I think I’m good. To have some more.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Like, do you want to open a store?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Where I can sell my photos and pottery? Of
course not. They’re terrible.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: They’re not terrible.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yeah, they’re awful.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I think you’re being hard on yourself –</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I’m not asking for sympathy. My voice is way
too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry
and subjectless. But who gives a shit? Not everything needs a goal. The
world is a playground. You know that as a kid but then somewhere along
the way everyone forgets.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: When? Like in a couple years?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I bought a ticket for four months from
now.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: People always talk about that, but you’re
actually doing it.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Honestly, I’m terrified.</p>
<p>****: How about you? Do you like the bank?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s lame, but you know, it’s pretty funny. My
boss Norman always throws theme parties.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: So if it’s lame why do you work there?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Because… it’s actually not lame.</p>
<p>****: I just gave the answer I’ve automatically given for years. I’m
actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever. I started this
pilot program that gives out microloans.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay
for paint so you can start a house painting business. Rather than paying
a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank.
Whatever. It’s kind of dorky.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: That actually sounds really cool.</p>
<p>****:</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: So, what do you say we hit this crazy
party?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Funny, not crazy. My boss is white noise.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: White noise?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You know, like totally boring.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I don’t know anyone who’s totally boring.
Crack a person’s shell – there’s always something creepy underneath.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Carl! Welcome. Or should I say,
uerukamu!</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I wouldn’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You didn’t tell her? This is a dress-up as
your favorite character from Heroes. Do you watch?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I currently don’t have a television.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t know what to do with that
information. There are drinks, chips, dips, various and sundry noshes. I
entreat you to make friends. Let’s get this party started!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We don’t have to stay long.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It’s a party. Let’s socialize.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m Carl. This is Renee.</p>
<p><strong>khatoon</strong>: Hey. I’m Khatoon.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>khatoon</strong>: Are you listed on
Persianwifefinder.com?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So, how do you know Norman?</p>
<p><strong>khatoon</strong>: Karate Club.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Baked Lays people! It is on!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re in a karate club?</p>
<p><strong>party guests</strong>: Norman! Norman! Norman!</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Told ya there was something weird under that
white noise shell.</p>
<p><strong>khatoon</strong>: You’re totally on persianwifefinder.com.
SultanCarl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Khatoon, Norman! You guys should spar!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Well, isn’t that cute? We’ve got a full match
on. Hey, I’m Jason.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m Carl. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Work for the INS.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I hate it. Everyday I have to dash some poor
guy’s dream. I’m a professional dream dasher.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It can’t be that bad.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: The other day, I turned down a guy who had
literally been a professor at the University of Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>cuban professor</strong>: What? But I’ve already lived here
for five years. I’ve received a steady paycheck and paid taxes for five
years. I speak fluent English. I can’t go back.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m sorry but no can do.</p>
<p><strong>cuban professor</strong>: I’ve passed the citizenship test
ten times. I bet you couldn’t pass that test.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>cuban professor</strong>: Do you know the location of the
Spanish-American war?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Spain?</p>
<p><strong>cuban professor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: America?</p>
<p><strong>cuban professor</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: Spainerica?</p>
<p><strong>cuban professor</strong>: You are an insult to your
country.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So did you let him in?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I sent him back to Cuba. I send them all
back.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: If you hate your job so much, why do you do
it?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Because I have to eat.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re a no man.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p>****: I’m not supposed to tell anyone this except for my Yesponsor,
but you can change your life. I’ve changed mine. If I tell you how, will
you promise not to tell anyone?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, sure, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I say yes. To everything. Say Yes More. It’s
that simple.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That’s the most retarded idea I’ve ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What did I miss?</p>
<p>****: Nothing. Do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You work for the ASPCA?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just love pets. This is Veronica, King
George, Owen, Carl jr., Carl the III, Carl IV, Bubbles, Greedo, Cat 1,
Cat 2 and Cat 3. At the end there, I got kind of bored of naming
them.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You don’t need to do that.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You have a lot of Mexican Viagra.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I have a congenital heart thing it helps. And
it’s cheaper than the stuff that’s made here.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You better not be a criminal. Because one
time I dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and I did not enjoy
living on the edge as much as I thought I would.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s cheaper to buy in bulk. Is that a
crime?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: A hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs
borders on something vaguely criminal.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: You must be Renee. I have heard so much
about you. Can I watch?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: No, you can’t watch.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You know what I would love? A massage.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I give great massages.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Oooh. Yeah. Oooh, right there.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How much does a Schwinn cost?</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Three hundred fifty three dollars. It’ll
really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground. I’ve
tried on foot. I only have a two mile radius.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Done and done.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Hey, the boys upstairs are here to speak
with you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Really? Because I have a thing at one…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: He asked for you specifically. Ixnay on the
small loans-ay.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Carl Kendall? I’m Chris Parker.
President of Southwest Bank.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I actually met you when I was just a
teller.</p>
<p>****: Of course! Pet-a-Puppy day. Free cookie day. Free half hour on
the bank’s punching bag day. You’ve upped walk-in traffic by 35%. Not
only that – you’ve also taken charge of corporate day care. I like a
team player.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: But then I got suspicious. What drives
a man in his mid to late thirties who’s still at the absolute lowest
level of our corporate family? Generous helpfulness? Or raging
revenge?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Generous helpfulness?</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Which is when I got the numbers from
your loan desk.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: You’ve given out over 682 below
minimum loans. One of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty
seven cents.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Janice Peabody’s ant farm rental business.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: How do you explain yourself?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ve started a microloan project. I figure
that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan
shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution?</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Because the paperwork makes any profit
moot. Unless you’re raiding our coffers.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No. I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I would if I could, so why wouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: You’re the kind of person we want in
corporate. We’re taking some clients on a golfing trip. You golf?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: You free tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Of course you are. I better watch my
back around you, Carl Kendall. Soon you’ll be taking my job. See you on
the links.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry – bank meeting stuff.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’ve never heard of a Wedding Shower cake.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You have to have one. Modern Bride calls them
a necessity.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m sorry, it’s just you’ve been so great at
all this while my husband- to-be has been completely absent. Do you have
time to grab a cup of tea?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Is he scared to get married? Is that why he
doesn’t care?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You know Peter. He’s a man’s man. He cares, he
just doesn’t know how to show it.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You know how to show it. A wedding is a huge
deal. I’m so scared.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You guys are perfect for each other.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I know that and yet I’m still so scared.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Maybe if you’re just honest with him about how
you’re feeling it’ll be OK.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He can be just so closed off.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sorry, the bank, you know? The UFO conference
is tonight? No, that’s fine, I’ll definitely be there.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’ve been so good to me. I’ve really come to
depend on you. I want to pay you back.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Peter tells me you might have some disposable
income these days.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: For some reason, the bank keeps promoting
me.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: If you want to look at some open houses, I’m
happy to waive my fee.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: So this is at the very top end of what you
could probably afford. Are you interested?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Are you sure? I mean, this is the first place
you’ve looked –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes. I’ve got to run.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m looking forward to meeting Renee
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: We’re all having dinner. Tonight.
Remember?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Right. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just think if we’re going to be rolling out
a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: If you’re interested in donating plasma, feel
free to sign up.</p>
<p><strong>weird professor</strong>: Between 1996 and 2000 England’s
Ministry of Defence paid security cleared experts to research UFOs. This
classified study was code named Project Condign.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: That’s fine. It’s only the very first time
I’ve met your friends.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It was work, it went crazy late.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What’s with the “They’re Out There” and “I
Gave” button?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Long story. Miss, could I have an orange
juice? Like fast?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Your wife found me a really great place. Built
in Bose surround sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen TV, roof deck with
jacuzzi.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Least I could do. At least he’s involved with
our wedding.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I likey your suit-ey. Hugo Boss?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, this old thing? Prada, I think.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You think? We went to three different Prada
stores to find the right fit.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What do yo do for a living, Renee?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I paint. I’m in a band. I do volunteer work
at a shelter. I teach ESL. I do balloon animal art. You know, a little
of this, a little of that.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You should check out her pottery. It’s really
big.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It is big. How about you guys?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Real estate broker.</p>
<p><strong>peter/kath/seb</strong>: Lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you’ll excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Have you made a decision about the wine?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, we’re kind of in a celebratory mood.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: In that case, may I suggest a 97 Petit
Rothschild?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Maybe we should wait for Peter to decide.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He doesn’t know crap about wine. Just pick
one, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why not? Let’s celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: With six people, I’d recommend two
bottles.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Do you rent or own?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I sublet. I have this corner of a loft.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s a really nice corner though.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: If you’re ever interested in buying, you
should ring me up.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I hate owning things. Because when you own
something, you suddenly are invested in that thing not breaking. And I
break everything. I’ve gone through three TVS in three years.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: How did you break them?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I smashed one with a hammer, dropped one off
my roof and the third one just went on the fritz. So I set it on
fire.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s on me! I’d like to split it between an
Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard, a Diners Club and my South Dakota
Bank Visa Check card.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nice job with Renee. She’s definitely odd,
but that’s not necessarily –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just spent $1500 on dinner.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Because the waiter asked me if I wanted the
expensive wine and you weren’t there to stop me!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t get mad at me about it. You can just
stop.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No I can’t. If I didn’t say yes to the band
flier, I never would have met Renee. If I hadn’t said yes to taking
charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and
then yes to the president’s golf trip, I wouldn’t be moving up. Each yes
leads to the next one. If I stop, it could all fall apart.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ve gone from a passive guy who always
said no to a passive guy who always says yes. Just saying yes is not a
legitimate life philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t know why I should be taking advice
from a guy who’s wife is pissed he’s not involved at all with the
wedding planning.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m involved.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You told her you don’t care whether the
invite’s cream or ivory.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t see the difference. Honestly, I’m
terrified.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s marriage, you know? The biggest thing
ever.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But you guys have dated for years.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re perfect for each other.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: She’s terrified too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Of course she is. I think you’ll both be a lot
less terrified if you’re terrified together.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But what if I really can’t tell the
difference between ivory and cream? Does that make me a bad husband?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What matters is that you pretend you can see
the difference.</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: It was wonderful meeting you!/I loved it!/Let
me know when you throw your next art thing!</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It was great meeting your friends.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: They’re a little stiff.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: They are a little stiff. What do you feel
like doing?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m actually going rollerblading with
Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Ralph?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You know, crazy rollerblading guitar man.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: The guy who plays at the promenade?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Any interest?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: No. It’s ten on a Friday night. And that
guy’s crazy. Don’t you want to go home and make out?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: Just go.</p>
<p><strong>crazy rollerblading guitar man</strong>: Which is why the
merman is not to be trusted, especially with the fisherman’s computer
brain.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That is really good to know.</p>
<p><strong>crazy rollerblading guitar man</strong>: You want to come see
the merman?</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I do this whole Habitat for Humanity
Thing.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I love the concept of charity. It’s
awesome.</p>
<p>****:</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: You speak Korean?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: You sneaky devil. I knew I should
watch my back around you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Is it a problem if I’ve never played golf
before?</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: You’re a funny one, Carl Kendall.
Remember, they have to win. In Asian cultures, there’s a concept called
Saving Face. You have to let them win. But if they smell for a second
that you haven’t tried your hardest, they’ll commit hari kari.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Metaphorically?</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Who knows? It’s a delicate balance,
Kendall. Like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile beneath
them. Make the wrong move, and the little girl will end up in the croc’s
maw.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Alright, buddy. It’s all you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just keeping them on their toes. Reverse
psychology. Tiger Woods does it.</p>
<p>****: Apartment.</p>
<p>****: I prefer light beer.</p>
<p>****: Three to five times a week.</p>
<p>****: Orlando.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Chris, you hit a 90. Nice one.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I bogied the fifth hole. I’m still
pissed about that.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Joo-Chan hit a 95. Nice work. As for Seung
Kim. You hit 453.</p>
<p><strong>seung kim</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry to say that team Korean Bank
International has won.</p>
<p><strong>pretty korean banker</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>pretty korean banker</strong>: Kiss me? Please?</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pretty korean banker</strong>: Am I not sexy? Have you not
heard of saving face?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re very sexy.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I’m promoting you to bank manager.
I’ve got my eye on you, boy. Don’t you forget it.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What’s up, chicken butt?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just got promoted to bank manager.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I was kidding. Not as sexy as it seems. It
gets in like everywhere. What should we do to celebrate?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Have dinner?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: How about Korean? Oh, no, you probably
already had some today.</p>
<p>****: No, we just had American food, American fare.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You’ve just been so busy – it’d be fun to
have a night just the two of us. I wish we could just go to the airport
and hop on the first flight outta here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I think we’re going to London.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oaxaca, senorita.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Moscow, Russia, comrade.</p>
<p>****: Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: My Singaporean accent. Pretty good, right?</p>
<p>****: We want two tickets on the next plane out of here.</p>
<p><strong>airline rep</strong>: Two tickets to… Lincoln, Nebraska. Have
a good time.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Lincoln, Nebraska! Here we come, baby!</p>
<p><strong>airline rep</strong>: That’ll be twelve hundred and thirty
three dollars.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Maybe we shouldn’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ve been promoted. I’ve got money to
burn.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Do you want to change your life through
Mahayana Buddhism?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Tony.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: How’ve you been? You… never called.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry. I’ve been busy.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yeah, well, I’ve been busy too.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Hey, who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’m Tony. I’m an old, close friend of
Carl’s.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Flight 2036 to Lincoln, Nebraska, now
boarding.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s our flight. We should probably get
going.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It was nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: See you soon.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Have fun. You abigail.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Hi, there. Would you mind switching
places with me? I want to be across the aisle from my mom.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: We’re actually flying together.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: It would really mean a great deal.
She’s very scared of flying.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where’s your seat?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m really scared of flying.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: So, now that we’re here, what should we
do?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, clearly we should go there.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I had no idea that the earliest switchboard
operator headsets weighed ten and a half pounds. That is
fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>elderly tour guide</strong>: I’ll connect you to the coast in
an instant with Alexander Graham Bell’s brand new invention – the
telephone! Just a haypenny per ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: We don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We’re here. We might as well.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: There’s, uhh, no power steering.</p>
<p><strong>tractor driver</strong>: It’s a tractor, not a Toyota.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry about the barn.</p>
<p><strong>tractor driver</strong>: Been meaning to tear this sucker
down anyway.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I think I might have whiplash from that
tractor ride.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just don’t sue me.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Watch your back, Carl. I mean it. I’m very
litigious.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This day has been so randomly incredible.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Would you… want to… travel around the world
with me?</p>
<p>****: I mean, I know we haven’t really been seeing each other for
that long, but I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I think I’m falling, you know… Are you… ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Before our flight, what do you say we grab a
couple Nebraskan steaks?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m definitely falling for you.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Excuse me. Would you mind bringing this
to my son?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Like you want me to bring it with me? On the
plane?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Fedex is so expensive and this needs to
get to him today.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah. Sure. I’d be happy to.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: He’s a tall, blond fellow named Sheldon
Winkleton. He’ll be holding a sign in the terminal with his name on it.
You are a dear.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I got US Weekly, Star and, for a little
culture, the National Enquirer.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: National Enquirer?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: They have movie reviews. What’s in the
package?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just a gift for some buddies back home.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I’m sorry, I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>dea agent</strong>: Put the package down! Put it down!</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>good cop bob</strong>: I’m Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bad cop bob</strong>: And I’m Bob.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes. I’m sorry. Just let the girl go. She
doesn’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>bad cop bob</strong>: We’ll see about that, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Some old lady gave me a package in the Lincoln
airport to deliver to her son, Sheldon Winkleton. That was really stupid
of me and I realize that now. I don’t know anything about anything.</p>
<p><strong>good cop bob</strong>: Just answer a few questions and I’m
sure we’ll get this all sorted out. Have you ever used illegal
drugs?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>good cop bob</strong>: Pot?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes. But that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bad cop bob</strong>: How about shrooms?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But that’s the only bad shit I’ve done. I
swear.</p>
<p><strong>bad cop bob</strong>: Never cheated on a girlfriend?</p>
<p>****: Yes, I have. But I was in high school. I was a mess. She had
cheated on me –</p>
<p><strong>bad cop bob</strong>: You disgust me.</p>
<p><strong>good cop bob</strong>: He’s a moron. But I think he’s telling
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>bad cop bob</strong>: I agree. No one ever admits to the
cheating question.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: So explain. Are you a drug smuggler?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Look, when the nice lady asked me to take them
on the plane, I thought they were chocolates.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You expect me to believe a nice lady asked
you to bring chocolates on a plane?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I know how it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I don’t think you do.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wait! I’ll explain better.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: So you’ve just been saying yes to
everything.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>****: Pardon the pun.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: See? Do you get it now? It’s nothing, just a
glitch really.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I thought we had so much in common but if you
just yes to everything I don’t know that we do. How do I know if you
even like Korean food?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Do you even want to travel around the world
at all or do you want to work at that bank and buy a lot of Prada
suits?</p>
<p>****: Yes. And yes.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: When I asked if you were falling for me all
you said was yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It wasn’t a lie.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yes. It was.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It’ll be over soon.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t care. Just take it all.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Chris will be with you in a moment. Would
you like something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: So I got a call from the police
department.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m not a drug dealer –</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I spent a couple years in prison
myself. So I backdated some stock options. Excuse me for trying to help
our bottom line, right?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You got to do what you got to do to help
Mr. And Mrs. Shareholder.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: We are their slaves.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Honestly, I prefer for all my top guys
to have been in the Big House. We’ve all eaten the slop. There’s a trust
there you can’t break.</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s right, we’re dropping the minimum loan
to one dollar, bank- wide.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Could you look through these numbers
and let me know which of our five branches have been lagging behind in
profit?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I thought I was just implementing the
microloan program.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: You’re a VP, buddy. You do it all
now.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Carl, I’m glad you could join us. So,
to keep you all updated, we should be merging with Korean Bank
International within the year.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You can’t close the Maple Branch!</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I know that Maple’s where you got your
start, but if I don’t lay those people off then I get laid off. It’s a
vicious cycle.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You don’t have to if you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: If we don’t close these branches than
KBI will buy our competitor instead of us and put us all out of
business. If you want to be an executive and get to do fun stuff like
your microloan project, then you also have to be the bad guy who lays
people off. That’s why we get paid the big bucks. To make the hard
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: The bank’s all I’ve got. Every morning I
restock the hard candy, polish the safe, write today’s interest rates on
the board.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: There are other banks.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: We have to protest the merger. Get some
grassroots action going. Grass looks weak, but it grows everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You don’t even work at the bank.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You should protest with us!</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Yeah! Protest with your employees! It will
only make you more popular!</p>
<p><strong>employees</strong>: Hell no! We won’t go! Hell no! We won’t
go!</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Throw a rock at him.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Yeah, throw a rock!</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Some asshole protestor threw a rock at
my head.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Those dicks.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I wish using hoses wasn’t such bad</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I think I made a mistake letting Renee go like
that. What if I’m supposed to go on that trip?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You own an apartment because of that job.
People don’t generally leave good jobs.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: But the bank doesn’t feel right…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, honey. I think we should go with the
tulips. I know roses are more romantic, but they’re also much more
clich�d. Babe, can you wait a second? I’m going to be on for a while.
Ask your guru. He’s the one who sent you on this retarded quest in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hi, Sanji. I’m Carl. Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Of course! Would you like to purchase my new
book, “The Power of Yes: Life is Yessy”?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Actually, I had a question for you…</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Well, this line is for book customers
only.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry to bother you again –</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: Can’t you see that I’m eating?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I have a really important question. I have to
choose between traveling around the world with a girl I’m really into or
choosing a job that will make me pretty well off. I don’t know which yes
to take.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: How well off?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t know why that’s important.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: I should know all the data.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A lot, OK?</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: This is what I recommend. Every winter, I
throw a two week long seminar in Aspen. It’s only ten grand a week and
it will open your mind up –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t want to go to a seminar. I just need
help with this question.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: For you, eight grand a week. I have helped
celebrities like Cher and Jack Welch. You will love it –</p>
<p>****: You’re a total con artist.</p>
<p><strong>sanji</strong>: I am not a con artist. Have I not set you on
the life path you desire?</p>
<p>****: I’ve put my life into the hands of a con artist! And because of
you I have this retarded yes branded on my hand for life!</p>
<p>****: This man is a con artist! Don’t listen to this man! He is a con
artist!</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: You are dead, AnalDestroyer832!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’ve slept on my couch for four weeks.
You’re a grown man. Now sack up and get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: Will you let me stay here please?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Are you deaf?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: You have to say yes if I ask you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You knew?</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I may not seem like I get it, but I get
everything. Lucy and Kath? Made out one time in the bathroom at
Rudy’s.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>nigerian king</strong>: Dear Carl, It is vitally important
you send me your bank account information. The government will be
closing in on my account in the very near future. Your good friend,
Omar, Former King of Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Omar, Let’s cut the crap. You are not a king.
You’re probably just a teenage con artist jerking off somewhere in
Russia. Write me again and I will find you and beat your stupid lying
face in. Dick. Sincerely, Carl Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>flier guy</strong>: You want to pawn –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dunkin donuts cashier</strong>: Would you like an –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, Luce. What’re you doing all the way over
here?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It’s been hard to reach you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ve been a little swamped.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah. Things are great.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I was wondering when you want to meet with the
florist.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sorry, but I’m too busy these days. Don’t have
time to help with the party anymore. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’re just stopping, just like that?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m not the one marrying you. Maybe you should
ask him for some help.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He is helping. Here I was thinking we were
actual friends.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: What is the best way for us to enter
the teenage credit card market?</p>
<p><strong>vp</strong>: Give away a free iPod.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>another vp</strong>: Include one with cans of Mountain Dew
Code Red.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Nice. Anyone else? Carl?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Have you guys thought that teenagers don’t
have the financial knowhow to use a credit card?</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: That’s why they’re such a ripe market.
Any ideas on how to pick that low hanging fruit?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Include a Mastercard with every xBox.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: I like that. I like that a lot.</p>
<p>****: Hey, Carl. Peter here. Long time no see. Sorry to hear you
won’t be planning our engagement party. Although I guess that makes you
less gay than I thought you were. We’ll be watching the game at Rudy’s
tonight, if you’re interested.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Dear Carl. I know this is kind of random, but
I thought I should write you. We met at that party at Norman’s
apartment. I was the INS guy who hated his life and hated you. I just
wanted to tell you that I took your advice. I quit my job and have
founded a home in Botswana for elderly orangutans. I’ve never been
happier. You told me to say “yes” and it has turned out to be
incredible. Thank you. Yours truly, Jason Newmark</p>
<p><strong>carl’s secretary</strong>: The executives are gathering in
the conference room to officially greet the KBI Officials.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s an elderly orangutan actually. Could you
please call everyone on this list and tell them to show up at Rudy’s Bar
&amp; Grille this evening at 9PM?</p>
<p><strong>carl’s secretary</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just want to say, it was really great having
you as my first secretary.</p>
<p><strong>carl’s secretary</strong>: You’re not firing me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t think I’m going to be working here
much longer.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: And I need to talk to you. You mind
doing a little ceremonial translating?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t know if I’m good enough at Korean
–</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Believe in yourself and the world
believes in you.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: KBI is the at the forefront of the
financial world. With your help, Southwest will be as well.</p>
<p>****:</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: We look forward to working together
and extending our reach across the globe.</p>
<p>****:</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: So with this hand shake, I make
official the acquisition of Southwest by Korean Bank International.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>seung kim</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>chris parker</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>seung kim</strong>: We have a traitor in our midst. This man
just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in
fecal matter. He is clearly trying to sabotage the merger.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You speak English?</p>
<p><strong>seung kim</strong>: You think an international bank financier
wouldn’t speak fluent English? For whom do you work, traitor? Shanghai
Bank? Chinatrust?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: For myself.</p>
<p><strong>seung kim</strong>: Fine. Keep it secret. Unfortunately, I
cannot approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a
business saboteur this high up. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I quit.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why does he want us here?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>kath</strong>: You guys get the call as well?</p>
<p><strong>iranian woman</strong>: I’m Farinoush.</p>
<p><strong>rooney</strong>: I’m Rooney.</p>
<p><strong>iranian woman</strong>: You’re tall.</p>
<p><strong>music cue</strong>: Rocky Theme.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Announcing the pending marriage of Peter
Carlton and Lucy Giuliano!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wow. There’s a horse in here.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Who are all these people?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I didn’t have much time to throw this
together. I got a stallion, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Thanks, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>music cue</strong>: The Black-Eyed Peas “My Humps”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’re you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I entrust you to sell all my shit.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>music cue</strong>: ABBA’s “One Night in Bangkok”</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I didn’t ask you a question.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, if you do that’s what my answer will
be.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Are you here because you want to be here?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just flew twenty-two hours. What do you
think? Now can I please kiss you?</p>
<p><strong>young thai man</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>old thai man</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>chyron</strong>: Makurdi, Nigeria</p>
<p><strong>machine gun guard</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m here to see Omar. The former King of
Nigeria.</p>
<p><strong>omar, former king of nigeria</strong>: Is that Carl
Kendall?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Omar! It’s wonderful to meet you in person</p>
<p><strong>omar, former king of nigeria</strong>: And this must be
Renee? What a delight!</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Thank you, your majesty.</p>
<p><strong>omar, former king of nigeria</strong>: Please, call me
Omar.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry for calling you a masturbatory
Russian teenager.</p>
<p><strong>omar, former king of nigeria</strong>: Water under the
bridge. What do you say to having a feast?</p>
