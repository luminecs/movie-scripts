<h1 id="the-hebrew-hammer">the-hebrew-hammer</h1>
<p><strong>gentile boy 1</strong>: Hey Mordechai, look. I dropped a
penny.</p>
<p><strong>gentile girl 1</strong>: Hey Mordechai. Want a bagel?</p>
<p><strong>gentile boy 2</strong>: Hey Jew nose, save some oxygen for
us.</p>
<p><strong>gentile girl 2</strong>: Hey Morty, my mom says that unless
your people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior
you’re all going to burn in hell.</p>
<p><strong>gentile boy 1</strong>: Hey everybody! Look what Mordechai
got. Nice spinning top Morty.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. highsmith</strong>: Now, now class let’s not make fun of
Mordechai’s spinning top. We need to all learn the importance of
tolerance and understanding. Isn’t that right Mordechai?</p>
<p><strong>mordechai</strong>: Yes Mrs. Highsmith.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. highsmith</strong>: So class, in honor of Mordechai’s
special day, I’d like for all of us to wish Morty a heartfelt Merry…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. highsmith</strong>: Cha-noo-kuh Day 7.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. highsmith</strong>: Very good class. I hope you’ve all
learned an important lesson today. Just because Mordechai’s people are
different from us…just because they might appear strange to us with
their furry hats, their beady eyes, and their long sideburns…not to
mention their bizarre customs and unnecessarily guttural, funny sounding
names…just because they control all of the worlds’ money, yet are too
cheap to buy their children anything better than spinning tops for
presents, does not mean that we can’t learn to respect and love them as
our equals.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. highsmith</strong>: Happy Chanoo-juah-kah Day 7
Morty.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Happy Hanukkah Maccabee.</p>
<p><strong>maccabee</strong>: Thanks Hammer!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Hammer, why don’t you come eat by us for
Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now. God willing, you should settle
down and marry.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but
right now G dash d’s the only one for me.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I can dig it.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Hammer, you’re the baaddest Hebe this
side of Tel Aviv.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Shabat Shalom!</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: Give it back! Give me back my yarmulke!</p>
<p><strong>teenage gentile</strong>: Hey Teddy, throw me the
frisbee.</p>
<p><strong>teenage gentile</strong>: We…we were going to give it back. I
swear to god.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Did you just take god’s name in vain?</p>
<p><strong>teenage gentile</strong>: No, no. It…It’s not like that. We
were just about…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Just about to leave, right?</p>
<p><strong>teenage gentile</strong>: Yeah, yeah, that’s right. We were
just about to leave. C’mon Teddy.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: I guess. Sometimes I wonder why I even
bother praying to one god.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Hey, hey! Be proud of who you are. You’re a
bad, bold, big-nosed, biblical brother. You feelin’ me?</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: Yeah. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Aveenooh Shalom Alechem little brother.</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: Thanks Hammer.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Stay Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Happy Hanukkah Tikva.</p>
<p><strong>tikva</strong>: Happy Hanukkah Morty.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: So, what’s shakin’ Yenta.</p>
<p><strong>tikva</strong>: Well, for stahters, your mother called. She
said to remind you that you’re having Shabat Dinner by her tomorrow, and
also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz, and she wanted me to
relate the following information to you.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Okay, what’s the information?</p>
<p><strong>tikva</strong>: She said to remind you that you’re having
Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the
Manischewitz.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>tikva</strong>: Yeah, I’m going to be out of the office from
1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to
see my gynecologist.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: But we’re not open on Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>tikva</strong>: I understand that. I just thought that you
might want to know.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I’ll be in my office.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: I want to start by thanking all of you
for pulling yourselves away from the workshop to make this emergency
meeting. I know it’s the busiest time of the year for all of you, so
I’ll try and be brief.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: My father, often referred to as
St. Nick The Nasty, was a tyrannical man. He was obsessed with making
Christmas the only holiday anyone could celebrate before the New Year.
Since his death, I’ve prided myself on ensuring that the Christmas
season is one of tolerance and understanding between all races and
religions. It’s always been my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa deserve
the same respect as Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: Lights please.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: Over the course of my career as Santa
Claus, I’ve made it my mission to ensure that Jews, Christians, and
African Americans could all observe their respective holidays in
harmony.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: I was responsible for pushing the Happy
Holidays Ordinance, in which all Merry Christmas signage was replaced by
the Trans-relgious and inoffensive phrase ‘Happy Holidays.’</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: It was nearly a decade ago, in
conjunction with our friends in the Jewish and African American
communities that I supported a bill that mandated that ‘Dreidel,
dreidel, dreidel’ and ‘I’m dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa’ be taught and
sung in elementary schools along with the Christmas standards ‘Frosty
The Snowman’, and ‘Deck The Halls.’ Which is why upon examination of my
annual naughty and nice list it shocked me to discover that my own son,
Damian…</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: The heir to the Red Suit could be so
filled with hate.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: Damian, when I learned of your
ludicrous scheme to wipe out Hanukkah, my first reaction was one of
disgust. Now, I’m only filled with sadness and disappointment.
Disappointed that I failed to teach you the true meaning of Christmas.
What do you have to say for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>damian</strong>: Ho. Ho. Ho.</p>
<p><strong>santa claus</strong>: Et tu, Blitzen?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: What are you fucking midgets looking at!? Get
back to work! We have Hanukkah to destroy!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Gentleman!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Gentleman! Please!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Sheket B’vakasha! Sheket B’vakasha!</p>
<p><strong>hall</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: The time for action is now. We predict that
the St. Nick Day Massacre will put Hanukkah-Christmas relations back at
least a hundred years. With this meshuggena new Santa Claus in power,
Hanukkah is in jeopardy. Our first order of business is to put into
motion a plan to create goodwill towards the Jewish Community.
Mr. Chairman of the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>harvey weinstein</strong>: Yes Chief.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We need your people to crank out a couple
more award winning documentaries on the Holocaust, possibly a new Adam
Sandler movie.</p>
<p><strong>adl chairman</strong>: Not another Adam Sandler movie!</p>
<p><strong>harvey weinstein</strong>: What’s wrong with Adam Sandler
movies?</p>
<p><strong>adl chairman</strong>: We’re trying to create goodwill here.
I just think…</p>
<p><strong>harvey weinstein</strong>: Frankly, I don’t care what you
think. I think you’re a putz.</p>
<p><strong>adl chairman</strong>: Don’t defame me. I’m against that.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Focus people. Our next order of business is
to assign an agent to track Santa’s activities. Step in and use force if
the situation calls for it. We need to put the toughest Jew we have on
the case. Suggestions? Suggestions, anybody?</p>
<p><strong>jdl member 1</strong>: What about Steven Spielberg?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: C’mon, he made ET. We need someone tough
people.</p>
<p><strong>jdl member 2</strong>: What about Itzahk Perlman?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: He’s in a wheelchair for crying out loud.</p>
<p><strong>jdl member’s 3 and 4</strong>: Allen Greenspan? Henry
Kissinger?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Too old.</p>
<p><strong>adl chairman</strong>: Joe Lieberman?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Missing in action.</p>
<p><strong>jdl member 1</strong>: Robert Shapiro?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: He’s a lawyer. We’re looking for heros
people.</p>
<p><strong>harvey weinstein</strong>: David Copperfield?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What’s he gonna do, make Santa disappear?
Think people think. We need a hard hittin’ Hebe on this one.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: What about Mordechai Jefferson Carver?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: The Hebrew Hammer? No. No way. After the way
he handled that situation in the West Bank? He’s the only Jew in the
world too extreme for the JDL. There’s a reason why we kicked him out of
our ranks, sweetheart. We need a man who can follow orders. A man with
self-control. We need a man…</p>
<p><strong>council elder</strong>: …We need a man who can get the job
done.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Daddy, he’s our only hope. And you know
it.</p>
<p><strong>adl chairman</strong>: Only problem is, ever since we kicked
him out, he wants nothing to do with us. There’s no way we can persuade
him to come back.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Perhaps I can persuade him.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: It was the day before Hanukkah when she
strolled into my office.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mr. Jefferson Carver?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Please, call me Mordechai.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: From the way she carried herself I could
tell she’d been around the block a few times…</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Sorry I’m late. Traffic was a pisher, and
I’ve been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking.
What are you listening to?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh, the things I would do to her if I had
the…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Client notes. Sorry. What can I do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: My name is Esther. Chief
Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately
needs to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal?
Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Actually, his days of marital infidelity
have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Your mother? Oh. Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out
by his son Damian. The man’s a demon. There’s no telling what this new
anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I’m sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good
friend, but my days…</p>
<p><strong>blonde bombshell</strong>: Mr. Hammer? I’d like to hire you
to put a tail on my husband. I think my life might be in danger. I think
he wants to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Sorry Shiksa, I think you got the wrong
office. I’m the Hebrew Hammer. Mike Hammer’s down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>blonde bombshell</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Listen. Esther, you seem like a nice girl,
so I’m only gonna say this once. I no longer affiliate myself with that
organization. The politics there were brutal. Besides, I’ve already got
a full case load.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: That’s…uh…that’s all done electronically
now.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Why are you being so difficult? All my
father wants is to just speak with…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I hate to cut you short, but in an hour the
sun goes down, and then it’s officially the Sabbath. I can’t work on the
Sabbath. This is where we’re going to have to part ways boobola.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: I’m not leaving your side until I get you to
agree to come speak with my father.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Be my guest. But I have to warn you, I’m
going to my mother’s for dinner tonight. And if you think I’m difficult,
wait till you meet her.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Before we leave, there’s just one more
thing. I noticed that the sign on your door says you’re a certified
circumcised dick. Would you mind if I asked to see your credentials?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Mordechai! Shabat Shalom!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some
Manischewitz. The black label.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: I can see. And you also brought a nice
girl to come eat by us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: So. Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: It’s Esther.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: From the story of Purim. Well, now that
we’re all acquainted, let’s sit down and start the Sabbath.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oy vey, I’m stuffed.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: I don’t think I could eat another latke if
you paid me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Everybody ready for the main
course?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mom, I think we’ve had enough.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Nonsense young man. You’ll eat
everything in front of you. After all, there are people starving in
China. Isn’t that right Mun Chi?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Not until Mordechai finishes everything
in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Mordechai!? So, Esther, how did you and
Mordechai meet. You know they call him the Hebrew Hammer for a
reason.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mom! Esther works for the JDL. They sent her
to try and recruit me back to save Hanukkah for them. What she doesn’t
seem to understand is that nothing, not even god himself could convince
me to ever work for them again.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: But Hanukkah’s in dan…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Not my problem. If you’ll excuse me now, I
need to use the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: You like my Mordechai, yes?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: He’s…he’s very nice. But Mrs. Carver, the
fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help
me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn’t even one
of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is
almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl. I’ll
make you a deal. I’ll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you
help me with my Mordechai.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: He works too much. God forbid he should
have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind
off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Is this something you could do for
me?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mom, where do you keep the plunger?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: It’s under the sink by my tampons!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: So, do we have a deal?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: So, what did you two ladies discuss while I
was gone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: I was just telling your nice friend
Esther about how I used to have such a problem with the gas. So, once I
started taking two charcoal pills before I ate, the gas cleared itself
right up.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Thanks. That’s…good to know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Mordechai. Do you love your mother?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mom, stop with this already. Of course I
love you. You’re my mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Then how come you won’t stop this
Certified Circumcised Dick nonsense and get yourself a real job.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for
this community. I help people.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: When I play bridge with all the girls,
everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures.
Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can’t I show a
picture?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: So don’t show a picture.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: You know my friend Maureen? Her son,
the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton.
What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid
you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you
could send me to Boca, too.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh. Oh, What. So, all of a sudden my saving
Hanukkah’s not good enough for you? Is that what your saying?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: I don’t want to argue with you. Let’s
just eat in peace.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: No. No. We’re gonna argue. And you know what
mom? I’m going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is
all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah
gifts next year, don’t mention it to them, okay? I wouldn’t want you to
have to show my picture.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Do what you must.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Such a good boy he is.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Mazel Tov!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: What’s that Mazel Tov? Your diaper
needs changing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Let’s let your tuchus breathe.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mom, why don’t you put that cat out of its
misery?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Because it isn’t god’s way. When you
spent the fourth grade in bed recovering from your bout with
hypoglycemia, did I put you down? No. Mazel Tov will lead a full life
just like the rest of us. Isn’t that right Mazel Tov?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Anybody hungry for desert?</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Jew Confirmation Test
initiated.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: You’ve gotta be kidding me. They’re still
doing this?</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Please state your full Hebrew
name.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mordechai Baruch Netanyahoo.</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Please state the six dishes
found on the Passover Seder plate in alphabetical order?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Beitzah, Charoset, Chazeret, Karpas, Maror,
and Zeroa.</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Please demonstrate musical
aptitude.</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Please step forward and remove
your undergarments.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oooh. That’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Circumcision confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>computerized voice</strong>: Final test initiated.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Hello? Can anybody hear me? I think this
machine is broken or something. Hello? This is ridiculous! I didn’t even
want to come here. I shlep all the way out to the middle of nowhere, for
lord knows what purpose, and…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I am so unhappy with this situation. Why
Mordechai? Why do you always feel it necessary to do what other people
want you to do? Why can’t you be your own man…</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: He’s still got it.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Welcome back Hammer.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Since you’ve been gone Hammer, some things
have changed around here. Our agents are now subjected to a strict
physical training regiment. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: A minion practicing Jew-do, the deadly
fighting art. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: There’s more. Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We’ve even relaxed our centuries old
admissions criteria.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Mordechai Jefferson Carver, I’d like for you
to meet the Jewish Defense League’s first black Jewish agent. A close
personal friend of mine, agent Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.</p>
<p><strong>sammy davis jr. jr.</strong>: The Hebrew Hammer? I’ve heard
about this cat. Your beautiful babe. Keep on keeping on.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Alright. I’ll, uh, keep doing that.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Sammy, if you’ll excuse us, Mordechai and I
have business to attend to.</p>
<p><strong>sammy davis jr. jr.</strong>: You two cats keeps purrin’.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Alright Mordechai, now that we’re alone I
just want to say that I’m not happy about this. I don’t want a repeat of
that incident in the West Bank.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I got the job done didn’t I? I did what I
had to do.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: A settlement completely demolished, ten
smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think
you’re above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him
back to us. No heroics, got it?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Hey, it’s your Bar Mitzvah. I’m just readin’
the Torah portion.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Well it’s good to see that you can be so
nonchalant about the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I guess I could be chalant about it, but
then again I’m not even sure if that’s a word. Listen Chief, we could
stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What’s your first move?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I’m gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if
they’ve got the 411 on Santa’s location. I’ll check in with you when I
know more.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: You be careful Hammer.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: The fate of Hanukkah rests squarely on your
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Okay. You guys have seriously got to stop
with that stuff. That’s a lot of pressure to put on one Jew. I’m only
human you know. I’m already shvitzing about the whole thing. You know,
believe it or not, I’m allowed to make mistakes, too. I can only do the
best that I can do, and that’s just gonna have to be good enough for all
of you.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Just…just stop with that. Okay? Alright, I’m
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>black teenager</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>black teenager</strong>: Hey, yo, we got ourselves a
visitor.</p>
<p><strong>baaad brother</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>black teenager</strong>: It’s some pimped out Hebrew dude in
a caddy.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: The Hebrew Hammer! My main Kike!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim. My main
nigga!</p>
<p><strong>white accountant</strong>: You…you just called him a
Kike.</p>
<p><strong>white accountant</strong>: And you. You just called him a
Nigger.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Well it’s okay when we call each other
that.</p>
<p><strong>white accountant</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your
bad self down to the KLF?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I’m back on the job for the JDL. You hear
about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here
in full alert mode.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Gotta always be cool under pressure. You
know what I’m sayin.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: True dat. True dat. So, what’s the word on
the street?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Word is that papa’s got a brand new bag,
and it’s velvety red, and it ain’t gonna be overnight Fed-Exed to
Jerusalem. If you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Actually, I…I don’t. What does that
mean?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Oh. It means that Santa’s gonna fuck
Hanukkah’s shit up.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Not if I can help it. You got any
information for me?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I don’t. But I know somebody who does.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Jamal, I’d like for you to meet the Hebrew
Hammer.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: ’Sup.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I’d like for you to tell him what you told
me.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: A’ight, a’ight, cool. Yo, it’s like this.
That nigga Santy Claus be trippin’. First that motherfucker kills his
own pops, then he start talkin’ ‘bout bustin a cap in Hanukkah’s ass.
Next, the racist motherfucker kick my ass out the workshop, sayin’ that
there ain’t no room for no little colored elves like me. Can you believe
that shit? Yo, if it wasn’t for the arthritis in my joints, you best
believe that I’d be…</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: …blam! blam! blam! Bustin’ caps all up in his
ass. You know what I’m sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Is there anything else you can tell me? His
hangouts, his next move, anything?</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Well, come to think of it, there is one
thing. Before I left, I was packin’ up my shit and I overheard the nigga
talkin’ to some business pahtnah or something. Sayin that he’d meet him
today at some joint called Duke’s. Round five o’clock if my memory
serves. When he got off the phone and jetted, I scoped the room for some
jewelry, cash, whatevers. You know, a severance package. Didn’t find any
duckets, but I did snatch this.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Thanks little brother, you’ve been a big
help.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Shit fool, ain’t no thang. If it wasn’t for
my real brothers here at the K.L.F., I’d be shining shoes at the train
station or getting my afro tossed up against a velcro wall in some
redneck bar somewhere. I finally gots a place where I belong. Fuck
Christmas. I’m all about smoking blunts and pimpin’ bitches. I’m all
about Kwanzaa nigga!</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: He’s new. He’s still got a long way to go
before he understands the true meaning of Kwanzaa.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Thanks again Mo, you always deliver the
goods.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might
just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There’s a
lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Okay, look. I’m going to work really, really
hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I’m already tense
as it is.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: It’s cool. It’s cool. Aveenooh Shalom
Alechem, brother.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Alekem Salam.</p>
<p><strong>salvation navy guy</strong>: It’s me. He’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Excellent. Everything is going as
planned.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: With the Hebrew Hammer out of the picture,
Hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce
word. I want to thank you very much Jamal for all of your help.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Pfff. Shit nigga, ain’t no thang. Hey, yo
Santy Claus, so does this mean that you gonna make me an official elf
now?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Can you believe this guy Tiny Tim?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Take a look around you Jamal. Do you see any
colored midgets in my workshop?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Your presence would be a disruption to the
utopian model of efficiency I’ve created here.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: That’s some cold shit.</p>
<p><strong>head elf</strong>: Utopian model of efficiency my ass! Ever
since you took charge, this place has been more like a sweatshop.</p>
<p><strong>head elf</strong>: We know our rights Santa! You’re in
violation of the union regulations! We’re going on strike!</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: You know something, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>head elf</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Yeah. This is a sweatshop. And since you
elves aren’t willing to do the work, I made arrangements to have some
Taiwanese children shipped over. And I might add, they’re more than
willing to work for peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Come on in boys!</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: So, what’s our first plan of attack
Santa?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: While I was in Taiwan negotiating the
solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally
manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the
planet. I bought the entire plant.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: I want you and your men to target every young
person in the Jewish neighborhoods of every major city of this country.
I want you to flood their streets with this product.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: What should I charge?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Oh, that’s the beauty of it. These are free
samples.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: So what’s in the boxes? Heroin?
Cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Worse.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic,
‘It’s A Wonderful Life.’</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: That’s some cold shit.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Manischewitz. Straight up.</p>
<p><strong>skinhead bartender</strong>: Usually we don’t serve your
kind. But since you had the balls to walk in here, Kike, I’ll pour you
one last drink before we lynch you.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Actually, can I have the black label?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I figure if this is my last drink, you might
as well leave the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>skinhead bartender</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Do you guys take Shekels? I just got back
from a trip in Israel, and all I’ve got is a fistful of Shekels.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: 5733. That was a good year for me.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Shabat Shalom, motherfuckers.</p>
<p><strong>television set</strong>: Papa, Papa! Mommy says that every
time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings!</p>
<p><strong>jewish mother</strong>: Maccabee! It’s time to light the
menorah!</p>
<p><strong>addict jewish child</strong>: Mom, dad. How come you made me
Jewish?</p>
<p><strong>adolescent hasidic boy</strong>: What? It’s a Hanukkah
bush.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Shlomo, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: Mommy says that every time you hear the
sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: Mommy says that every time you hear the
sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Bootleg ‘It’s A Wonderful Life’ from
Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Sixty five percent pure. Damn! People could
get hurt watching this shit. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: Chaim Potok’s The Chosen?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Get yourself home and watch this as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>shlomo</strong>: Mommy says that every time you hear the
sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Hey, hey, hey! You can beat this. Now get
going.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: 555-55-555-55555…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: …5.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Chief, it’s me. Listen carefully. I need for
the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of
every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist
as its lead.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl,
Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok’s The Chosen?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: That’ll work. Get them out to the Jewish
community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We’re on it Hammer. How’d you do with
Santa?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: It was a trap. I’m back at square one.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Well, then I’ve got good news for you. We
just got word that he’ll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America
today. I’m sending Esther to meet you there at once.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Good thinking. We’ll disguise ourselves as a
Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I’m dead, this
should be a piece of homentashen.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: One last thing Hammer. You take care of
yourself. The…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: The fate of Hanukkah. Right. Right. Yeah,
Got it. Will do. Okay, bye now.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: One partridge in a pear tree to two turtle
doves. What’s your status?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Nothing stirring here.</p>
<p><strong>blonde gentile girl</strong>: Can I be next? Please,
please!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Let’s get a look at you, shall we.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: A power muff girls T. Very nice. Alright, now
spin around.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Very nice! Alright. You’re cool. Go on and see
Santa, sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>freckle faced gentile boy</strong>: That’s not fair! How come
she gets to go next? We were here first!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Oh really! Is that a fact? Well guess what
buddy? You ain’t gettin’ in to see Santa today, so why don’t you just
turn around and high tail it home.</p>
<p><strong>freckle faced gentile boy</strong>: But I’ve been waiting to
see Santa all year.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: But I’ve been waiting to see Santa all
year.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You heard me. Get moving punk!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Any sign of Santa?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We’re
undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther,
the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile
would.</p>
<p><strong>samples woman</strong>: Could I interest you in a free sample
bacon cheeseburger?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: While I thank you, Gentile friend, for your
generous offer of that deliciously unkosher snack, I sadly have to
decline for I stuffed myself full of meat and milk product at a prior
lunch engagement.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Can I have everyone’s attention please. In
fifteen minutes, Santa’s gonna have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Ah, don’t be like that kids. We gotta lot work
to do if we’re gonna get all those presents out in time.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey! Hey! You want shitty ass presents for
Christmas? You want Barbies with heads screwed on backwards? You want
remote control cars without the batteries included. Then be my fucking
guest!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: What are we going to do? We’re at least an
hour from the front.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: C’mon follow me.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Is that…? No, couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey, hey! Not so fast.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: We have to get through. It’s an
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Sorry pal, you’re gonna have to wait in line
just like all the other parents.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: We’re so sorry to have to cut, but our
beautiful Gentile boy ran on ahead of us in line.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: It would mean so much to Paul and I if you’d
let us through to see Santa.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well…umm, when you put it that way. Sure go on
through.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: You’re good!</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: And what do the Jewish people do during
Hanukkah?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They worship the devil and sacrifice small
Gentile children like me in bizarre, sadistic rituals.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: That’s right. Santa can tell that you’ve been
a very good boy this year. Run along now Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Sorry folks, I don’t do couples.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: If you keep your mouth shut and come with
me, you won’t get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look
around you. Do you even know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Let me guess, you’re the goy who stole
Hanukkah.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: The Hebrew Hammer! You’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What’s your shpiel, Santa?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Whoa, whoa there. C’mon Mordechai, is this
any way to treat an old family friend? Let’s cut out all the
unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah
thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering? Girls.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Bambi. Tawni. I’d like for you to meet world
renown Semitic super stud, Mordechai Jefferson Carver.</p>
<p><strong>bambi</strong>: Oh, I declare I just love Jewish men. They’re
so sensitive and well read.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Sorry Santa. I like my women like my matzah.
Unleavened.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: This is where you go down.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey, hurry it up in there. We gotta bunch of
kids…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Back it up buddy!</p>
<p><strong>mc hammer</strong>: Please Hammer, don’t hurt em’!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Let’s do this clean. I don’t want to make a
scene Santa.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Well, it’s a bit too late for that now, isn’t
it? Excuse me children, if I could have your attention for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: I’m just calming the kiddies. There’s no need
to worry about Santa. He’s just having a peaceful, adult conversation
with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Hey everybody. How’s it hangin’?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: In fact, he’s just informed me that he
personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Why don’t we show him how that makes us
feel.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>throng</strong>: Where’d they go? I saw them go down that
hallway. C’mon, let’s get em’!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: It’s over. We’re doomed.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Shh. Shh, listen. Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>harriet tubbelman</strong>: Psst. Hammer, Esther. This way.
Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: You saved our lives. Thank you. How can I
ever repay you…?</p>
<p><strong>harriet tubbelman</strong>: …My name is Harriet Tubbelman,
but you can call me Moses. The only payment I ask Mordechai, is that you
keep Hanukkah safe for us all.</p>
<p><strong>harriet tubbelman</strong>: You should be safe from here on
out. Just follow the river to it’s conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>harriet tubbelman</strong>: Oh yeah, and keep your arms and
legs inside the water craft at all times.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Where are we? What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>harriet tubbelman</strong>: Welcome to the Underground Jewish
Railroad. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: That got annoying fairly quickly.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Yeah, no kidding.</p>
<p><strong>carnival worker</strong>: Tickets please.</p>
<p><strong>carnival worker</strong>: Thanks for riding the Underground
Jewish Railroad. If you plan on returning today, please make sure to get
you hands stamped before you leave the alley.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Nah, we’re kosher. Thanks though.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: So, now what?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Now we wait for Santa to make his next
move.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Want to get a drink?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Sure. Why not.</p>
<p><strong>bandleader</strong>: Hey! The Hebrew Hammer everybody!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: So, do you come here often!?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What was that!?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: I said, do you come here often!?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh. Yeah, about once a week!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I said, yeah, about once a week!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>hasidic bar patron</strong>: Would you like to dance?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I’m okay right now. Thanks though.</p>
<p><strong>joshua</strong>: Hey Morty, wanna cut a rug?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Nah, I’m good. I’m kind of here with
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>joshua</strong>: Oh. Okay. Maybe next time.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Yeah. Maybe next time Joshua. Take it
easy.</p>
<p><strong>chaim feygele</strong>: Well Shalom there mister!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Do we know each other?</p>
<p><strong>chaim feygele</strong>: No, but we have mutual friends.</p>
<p><strong>chaim feygele</strong>: The name’s Feygele. Chaim
Feygele.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mordechai. My friends call me Morty.</p>
<p><strong>chaim feygele</strong>: So Morty, I just love a man in a
black suit. Care to dance.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Uhhh. You know, I…have to go to the
bathroom. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Hey there.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Do you want to get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: I would love to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Sorry. I’m better with men.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Maybe we should try a different kind of
dancing.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: You mean like disco dancing or doing the
funky chicke…Oh. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Now we’re talking Boobola.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mordechai?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Yes Esther.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: I want you to talk dirty to me.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I want to have lots of children by you. Get
a good paying, stable job. Settle down in Long Island somewhere.
Someplace nice. Fancy. But not fancy schmancy.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I want for our children to go to private
schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for
college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Afterwards they’ll make the decision as to
whether or not they’d like to continue their religious studies in
Israel. Because, hey, after all we’ll have practiced the highly
effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a
healthy dose of liberalism.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Oh god, yes! Keep going! Don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell
me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Kiss me you Semitic stud!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Hmm. I feel something poking around down
there. Maybe I should investigate. What do you think about that
Mr. Certified Circumcised Dick?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Shabat Shalom!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Wow, that was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: What did you just snort?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Antihistamine. It’s for my allergies. The
capsules make me gassy.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: You know, I’ve been thinking about what
Santa’s got planned for us next. Maybe he’ll…</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Your mother was right. You do work too
hard.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh, she said that, did she? What else did
Mommy Dearest have to say?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Well, she also said that you need to find a
nice girl to help take your mind off of your work. I’m just glad she
thought I was good enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: When did you guys have this conversation?
When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful.
She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said
she’d help me get you to work with the JDL if I’d come eat by you once
in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She’s so…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What? You made a deal with my mother to
sleep with me if I’d help you?!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: No. Of course…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What does that make you? What does that make
me? And my mother. What does that make her?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh my god. She’s become my pimp. And she’s
whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: No. It’s not like that. You’re being
completely neurotic. I was just playing along…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Always meddling in my life. This is so
typical of her. But from you? I thought we had something good here.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: We do!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I’m sorry Esther, I just don’t think we can
see each other romantically anymore.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Hammer here.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Hammer, it’s the Chief. We’ve got ourselves a
situation. Get yourself down here, I’ve got something you need to
see.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Mordechai. Thank god you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: About an hour ago, we received this
transmission from the North Pole.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: And now my Hanukkah loving friends, I will
reveal to you the true nature of my diabolical scheme.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: The Jewish Atomic clock, located in the
outskirts of Jerusalem. Keeper of time for the Jewish Calendar. Powered
by Judeum. An element so rare, it exists only inside the clock
itself.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Once I extract the Judeum from the clock, the
Jewish Calendar will cease to exist, forever eradicating Hanukkah. In
less than twenty four hours, which by your Jewish Calendar is
approximately…</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Can I borrow that pen and notepad?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Four years and three quarters a lunar cycle?
Well, whatever! In less than twenty four Christian hours, Hanukkah will
be nothing more than a fond memory. Tiny Tim.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Merry Christmas everybody, and god bless
us, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: End transmission.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: So, how was I?</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: It was good. Very chilling, but you still
got all the points across that we talked about.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Really? Good, good.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: I wasn’t too over the top?</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: No, it was the perfect level.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that
new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were
right, it is good.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Why is the red light on the camera still on?
Are you still filming me!?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: You fucking ass…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Looks like I got a plane to catch.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Take Esther with you, you’ll need the
backup.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: No way, it’s too dangerous. Besides, my days
of hooking are over.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: You’re not my bitch Mordechai. Please, you
have to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Did I miss something here?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: It’s a long story. I’ll explain when I get
back from saving the clock.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Alone.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Tail him. He’s gonna need the help.</p>
<p><strong>israeli woman’s voice</strong>: Shalom. Welcome to the Ben
Gurion airport. For ground transportation, please proceed to Terminal
18.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Do you speak English?</p>
<p><strong>israeli rental agent</strong>: Yes. Chello.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Chello.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I need to rent your biggest Cadillac.
Preferably lowered, with white wall tires.</p>
<p><strong>israeli rental agent</strong>: I’m so sorry sir, but somebody
just rented our last Chadillac.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Well what else do you have?</p>
<p><strong>israeli rental agent</strong>: Well, we do have a Ch…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Whatever it is, I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>head elf</strong>: Go, go, go!</p>
<p><strong>head elf</strong>: What’s this doing here?</p>
<p><strong>elf flunky</strong>: Not sure. I think it was left over from
an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television special. You want me to get rid of
it?</p>
<p><strong>head elf</strong>: No time. Besides, it’s not like someone’s
gonna jump their motorcycle into the building while we’re inside.</p>
<p><strong>head elf</strong>: There’s Santa now.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: No. I’m airsick you asshole! Where the hell
did these reindeer learn to fly?</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: I don’t know. Why don’t you ask them
sir.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Who’s the leader of this operation?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: What’s your major malfunction, dumbfuck!?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Step forward son!</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Uh, he can’t sir. The harnesses.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: You gonna learn to guide this sled right? You
gonna make sure your men follow suit? Because if I’m puking down
chimneys come Christmas Eve, I’m gonna have your hide. We clear?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: You eyeballin’ me son!?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: The Jewish Atomic Clock.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Get moving! We’ve got work to do!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Uh. Can you just give me one second?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Let’s dance the hora!</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Get him boys!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mordechai! Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mordechai, I love you. I couldn’t let you do
this alone.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I love you too. I’m sorry about freaking out
yesterday. I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Go check on the clock. I’ll finish up
here.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Get off of me you cripple!</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: What are we gonna do? He’s got us on the
ropes.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I don’t know. I’m feeling kind of tired.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: What’s going on? Why’d he stop?</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Maybe he ran out of ammo.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Well, he’s kinda just resting in the
corner with his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Resting?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: What day is it?</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: It’s Friday.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: I don’t know. About sundown I guess.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Why didn’t I think of this? It’s the
Sabbath.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: The day of rest. He can’t fight on the
Sabbath. C’mon, get up. We’ve got him beat.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Well, well, well. It looks as if the Hebrew
Hammer’s got a weakness after all.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Finish extracting the Judeum from the clock.
Tiny Tim, I want you to introduce the Hebrew Hammer to the Christmas
spirit.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: You want me to be nice to him for no
apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he’ll never wear, and for
just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible
things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn’t looking?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: No dipshit, I want you to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Santa’s gonna take the sled back to the North
Pole and celebrate his victory with his new stocking stuffer.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Esther!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mordechai!</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Take a look Hammer. The clock’s already
beginning to power down.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Ah. What’s the matter? No more snappy one
liners.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Merry Kwanzaa nigga!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Mordechai, you’re back. The clock?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Still ticking. Thanks to the help from the
Brothers at the KLF, Hanukkah’s safe for now.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: That’s wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: So why the long face?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: It’s Esther. Santa’s got her.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: My Esther! Oh Mordechai.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Please. Will you help me?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I love her sir. If I don’t help you, I won’t
be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed
to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Asalam Alekem.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: You’re a mench. Thank you. Mordechai, by any
means necessary, you bring my Esther back to me. Even if it requires
using Judaism’s most powerful weapon.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh no, not the…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: There won’t be any need for that sir.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely
in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I know sir. I won’t let you down.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.</p>
<p><strong>sammy davis jr. jr.</strong>: You two cats are beautiful. I
love you guys. You take care babe.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: He’s still working out some identity
issues.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: It’s gonna be tough, but the back entrance
looks like our best bet.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I wanted to ask you, how were you able to
pinpoint the exact location of Santa’s workshop? We’ve been trying to
gain that piece of surveillance for years.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: This is the year 5734. It’s time the boys at
the KLF got into the 58th century. Let me show you something.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: The JDL supplies all its agents with this
state of the art device called a laptop computator.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Cool. What’s it do?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Now this might get a bit technical, but try
and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other
computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps,
villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few
simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Man, that’s far out! Hey, the Jets
won!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: But wait, there’s more. With a few swift
clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse,
I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a
friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Porno? You’re tellin’ me that you can get
porno on that thing?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh yeah. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: For example, here’s a picture of your sister
Tawanda getting freaky with a German Shepard.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Gettin’ freaky with a what?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Oy vey, that’s almost as bad. That’s
Tawanda getting freaky with a notorious white supremacist.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Where’s the white out button on this
thing?</p>
<p><strong>computerized female voice</strong>: Message sent.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Remember that bit about the cyber postal
route?</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Nah, forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Rudolph, more egg nog!</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Ho, ho, ho.</p>
<p><strong>sassy black prostitute</strong>: Listen motherfucker, I
already told you! I don’t care how much yo ass is payin’ me, if you call
me that one more time there ain’t gonna be no more visits down to the
South Pole! You feelin’ me!?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Yes maam, loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>sassy black prostitute</strong>: Damn sugar, what happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: Santa, I got some really bad news.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Just praying to god that we don’t kill
ourselves going over this wall.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: You know, you don’t have to hold on to my
waist. You’re tied in.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I knew that.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Well, that was easy.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that
my research has determined that Santa’s compound is wired with the XP
2000 stereo type alarm system.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: A stereo type alarm system?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: How do we bypass it?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: The alarm will trigger if the system detects
any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you
were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word
dawg…that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o…within the
confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Listen cat, I’ll have you know that I hate
the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Well that’s good news for us. It means the
system is outdated. This should be easy. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: It’s all clear. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mo, I think you dropped some…</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Hammer, no!</p>
<p><strong>loudspeakers</strong>: Jewdar alert! Jewdar alert!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: C’mon, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock
stuff ate up a lot of our budget.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: There’s Tiny Tim.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: I’ll take Tiny Tim. You go find your
woman.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Hey, what’s that over there? Is that a bowl
of Matzah Ball soup?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Now I’m gonna do to you what I should have
done earlier.</p>
<p><strong>tiny tim</strong>: My crutches. Noooo. Not my crutches.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Where’s my girlfriend Santa?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: I don’t have to tell you anything Hammer!
You’re gonna have to kill me before I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: But if I kill you, then you’ll be dead.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Don’t worry your pretty little head.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: That was a warning shot.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mordechai! I’m in here! Help!</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Looks like the tables have turned once again
Hammer.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: And you won’t even be able to say goodbye to
your Esther. So sad. So long Mordechai. Give my father my regards.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Wait! I didn’t want it to come to this, but
you leave me no choice. I have no other option but to use the most
powerful weapon in the Jewish arsenal.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for
this? I come to fight you, and you don’t even put out anything to nosh
on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won’t work on me
Hammer. I’m too strong for it.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: What sort of host would treat company this
way? Esther is clearly uncomfortable in your guest room. I’m shvitizing
from running around shooting people. And my feet. What kind of flooring
is this anyway? My arches are killing me.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: No. Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: And to top it off, you didn’t even have the
courtesy to give me a proper hello when I entered the room. What have I
ever done to you to be treated with such disrespect?</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Please, make it stop. I’ll do anything. Here
take my gun.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Shoot me. Please, just one to the head. Put
me out of misery.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed</strong>: Hammer, you alright?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Everything’s kosher. Watch him for me.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Esther!</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Mordechai!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Joseph Lieberman?</p>
<p><strong>joseph lieberman</strong>: Mordechai! Thank god you’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: You two know each other?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: We go to the same temple.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mo, get him out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: No, wait. I need closure here. I just wanna
say one thing. You know where you messed up Santa? You underestimated
the true meaning of Hanukkah.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Please tell me. What is the true meaning of
Hanukkah?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: That’s…that’s a very good question. And I do
know that it does have something to do with…dreidels, and…</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: …and latkes.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: And latkes! And some miracle oil that lasted
eight days. And that my friend, should’ve been enough for you. Take him
away Mo.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: I’m sorry. I see the light now. I was wrong.
I’m…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, will you
marry me?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Yes! Of course! I’d gladly give up my last
name to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>joe lieberman</strong>: What happened out there?</p>
<p><strong>joe lieberman</strong>: Oh Mordechai, you know how I detest
gore.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Well then maybe you should have thought
about that before you ran with him. C’mon, let’s get you back to
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Shabat Shalom everybody!</p>
<p><strong>hammer/esther</strong>: Shabat Shalom!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: And a Merry Christmas to all of our Gentile
friends. Mun Chi.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Before we start the Sabbath, I’d personally
just like to thank god for all the blessings I’ve received over the past
year. A beautiful fiancee…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: …a wonderful mother…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: …and the opportunity to help my brothers and
sisters in the Jewish community.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Well I’m just glad you’re safe Bubba
Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Thanks mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: But with all the attention the
newspapers and television have given you, you’d think that you were the
pope or something.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Well, I did save Hanukkah mom. My children,
and my children’s children, and my children’s children’s children…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: …and their children will all be able to eat
latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: …So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I
mean, let’s be honest Mordechai, it isn’t even one of the high
holidays.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Now, if you had saved Passover or Yom
Kipur, then maybe you’d have what to brag about. Did I tell you that my
friend Maureen’s son, the Investment Banker, was responsible for a very
big merger on…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: …No, no, no, no, no. I see what you’re doing
here. So all of a sudden Hanukkah’s not good enough for you, is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Well I have news for you mom. It is good
enough…I’m good enough and I won’t leave here until I hear you tell
me…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Mazel Tov!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee
boo…</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: …I’m not finished yet, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: …A boojee boojee boojee boo. What’s
that Mazel Tov? Your tuchus needs some more airing out?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Mom! We’re eating!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: What a good poop you made in your
diaper Mazel Tov! That’s right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you
are!</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Oh, I get it. To you, the cat pooping in his
diaper is somehow better than my saving a Jewish holiday. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: So, what are you two planning after the
wedding?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Well, for starters, we’re going to honeymoon
in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty’s been talking
about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: Well, I couldn’t be happier for the
both of you.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: I think I hear the new Santa Claus busy at
work. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carver</strong>: I forgot to ask you, who’d they put in
charge as the new Santa Claus?</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Since Santa will be living out the rest of
his days at a home for the religionally insane and because he had no
blood heirs, the Kwanzaa Liberation Front and the Jewish Defense League
agreed to make the whole Santa Claus process a democratic vote. We’re
all very pleased with the first Santa elect.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Look, there he is now.</p>
<p><strong>hammer</strong>: Merry Christmas Jamal.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Merry Christmas Niggas!</p>
