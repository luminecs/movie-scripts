<h1 id="edtv">edtv</h1>
<p><strong>1 int. high school gymnasium - night</strong>: The following
is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE. A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It
was a big game. Some kind of championship.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You quit! You gave up!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You quit!!</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Qutters! … Quitters!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And that would be it. I don’t think you need
any narration at all. Just end it right there.</p>
<p><strong>2 int. office - day</strong>: BEGIN CREDITS</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: It’s horrible, it’s depressing, I love it.
What else?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I want to re-pitch that pregnancy idea. Find
six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through
to the births.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Yeah, when all that stuff comes out.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I have an idea.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: This is something I’ve been thinking about
for a long time. We’re “Real TV” right? I mean that’s the name of the
station.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: So let’s go real. We find someone. Just a
regular person, someone. And we put their life on television - live… all
day long.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: What do you mean, like PBS did in the
seventies? What was that family?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: The Louds.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No. We go way beyond that. We don’t film it
and edit it and put it on later. We go on the air live every morning and
the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. In between,
we’re on live all day, every day - the same person, – for let’s say a
month.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: That’s not a show that’s a surveillance
camera.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: You can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: The hell we can’t. Look, the beauty of
being a cable channel is we can take chances. I’ve thought about this
and I’m telling you, I think this can make a noise. A loud one. There
are twelve thousand channels. You’ve got to do something that says “Look
at me!” Hell, people look at fish tanks all day. This is people!
Someone’s real life – an TV, all day long - live… And, you know what?
I’m doing it.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: In that case, we love it.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. pool hall - day</strong>: A BUS passes. On the bus is
an ad. It says, “Would you like to star in your own TV show? Call Real
TV Coming .”</p>
<p><strong>4 int. pool hall - night - paramus new jersey</strong>: This
is a nice upscale pool hall. A party is in progress in a special private
area – a room upstairs let’s say – a loft. Thirty or forty PEOPLE in
their twenties and thirties are informally celebrating the engagement of
two of their friends.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I want to congratulate Kevin and Tracy on their
engagement. I knew you guys were meant for each other from the moment
Tracy told us she was pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You asshole!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What? What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: My mother’s going to see this!</p>
<p><strong>5 int. party - later</strong>: Other people are being
“interviewed” on tape. Ed is SHOOTING POOL with his buddy, JOHN. John’s
had a couple of drinks. He’s a little melancholy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look at this – people are getting married,
they’re getting married…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You said that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re falling behind.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know who we are?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re the guys who clean up after the
parade.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m gonna stick this right in your eye.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was at this comedy club last week and this
comedian says “If you’re over thirty and your job requires you to wear a
name tag, you screwed up your life.” And I’m laughing and then I realize
I wear a nametag.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So do I. So what? I’m doing all right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Your brother’s here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I was… having dinner with Shari and her
parents.</p>
<p><strong>john/ed</strong>: Oooh!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m telling you, it’s closing in on me. All of
a sudden it’s like a thing, it’s a whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you mean all of a sudden? You’ve been
going with her six months.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I know. I mean I’m sitting there and her
father’s asking me about my “career prospects” and I’m playing “Risk,”
with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog’s sniffing at my balls
– at least I hope it was the dog. ’Cause her mother disappeared for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>6 int. party - later</strong>: It’s getting wild. Some of the
girls are dancing raucously.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know, those are for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh! Show them that thing you can do. This is
great. I just found out she can do this, her brother told me. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I don’t -</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Whoa!! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is that unbelievable?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: And that concludes today’s show. This is
where you go around and collect the money.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: You guys know my roommate, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s going on over there?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Everybody’s making audition tapes for that
Real TV thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about
this?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day
long or something?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You know, that would be like a great thing.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That! Being that guy. Being the guy they
watch.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, but let’s stay on one subject. Whoever
that person is is going to be famous. They’ll be able to get whatever
they want. They’ll … trust me, this is my business.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What is?!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Show business.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’re in show business?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah. I service video equipment.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s like… those people stitching Nikes in
Panama saying they’re in the NBA.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not stitching Nikes in Panama! …
Bedwetter!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Thumbsucker!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m making a tape.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We’re excited.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. bar - a few minutes later</strong>: Ed and Shari,
waiting for drink orders.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So Ray met the family.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I hear the dog really liked him.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course,
they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for
three years and dumped me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Really? You see, to me, you shouldn’t have any
trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: You shouldn’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>8 int. table - a little later</strong>: Ed and Shari
ARM-WRESTLING. After a struggle, Ed wins. Ed is impressed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: And, you know, every guy I ever broke up
with, the minute it was over, I could tell you what went wrong, how it
went wrong, why it had to go wrong… but when I’m in it… lost. I’m like a
love coroner. Bring me the corpse, I’11 tell you what killed it. But how
to prevent it? Lost.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ray’s on.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hi. I’m Ray Pekurney. I’m from Paramus, New
Jersey…</p>
<p><strong>9 int. cynthia’s office - day</strong>: She’s watching Ray’s
tape. Ray thinks he’s funnier and cuter than he is.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: All my friends tell me “Ray, you’ve got too
much personality for one guy.” It’s like at a party – I’m at the center
of the attention. Everybody loves me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ha, ha, ha. I’ll kick your ass. No really, let
me show you my girlfriend. She’s really cute.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: She’s strong, ’cause she’s a Fedex girl. She
lifts those packages. But she’s not dikey at all, she’s really
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hello I’m Ed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What smells?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What is that smell? Oop, I think it’s this idea.
One person on TV all day long? Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Seriously, get your resumes in order. When my
brother Ray - whose personality you were just dazzled by – told me he
was going to try out for this – I said, “why in the world would anyone
want to be on TV all day long, no privacy, everybody knowing your
business, exposing every single detail of your life I mean… why would
anyone want to do that? But then I thought of a reason… Why the hell
not?</p>
<p><strong>10 int. video store - day</strong>: This is a video store in
Paramus, New Jersey. It’s busy. PEOPLE are in line to check out
tapes.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh for – Put those – Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We’11 take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Here. This time throw it out, don’t eat it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Lou, can I talk to you a second?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Um, yeah, I was gonna …</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s the deal? Did anybody make a decision
-</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Ed, look, uh… you’re not getting the job.
They’re gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store
when I leave to manage the new store. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I batted!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You batted or you bunted?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I
mean, you know, let’s face it – you come and go here as you please. You
work when you feel like it – you know, Bruce Springsteen’s birthday is
not a legal holiday.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, then I’m quitting.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Ed, come on. What’s that gonna do? You’re gonna
bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It’s
called “Get your shit together before it’s too late.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Ed, telephone.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah… Are you serious? … Come on, no kidding,
who is this? … Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>11 int. conference room - another day</strong>: Ed is being
interviewed by the “Real TV” staff whom we met earlier. He’s slightly
less comfortable than on his tape, but he’s good.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I had one year of college. And then one year of
junior college.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: What did you study?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, see, studying would’ve been a huge help.
Where were you, then?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, there’s Ray, my brother. He’s… ambitious.
Like a few years ago, he started this mobile dog-grooming business. But,
like, out of his Camry. He had this bathtub in his trunk - he’s throwing
the dogs in there, they’re fighting and splashing, then he’d slam the
trunk down, let ’em run around inside screaming getting all wet… then
he’d use the car exhaust to dry’em. Ah, Ray… he just can’t get a
break.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: My sister – Marcia, I mean she can’t get a
break. About seven years ago she falls in love with this Vietnamese guy
who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country. So they get
married, they have a kid, he gets his citizenship, immediately divorces
my sister and marries this Vietnamese woman who, he was probably already
married to all along. She can pick ’em. She’s got a nice little boy,
though. My nephew, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: My Mom’s okay. Kinda. I knew a guy who hated his
mother - Stuey Shwam. He hated his mother so much, he had his belly
button removed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, I’ve never been married.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, my father -what an asshole. When I was
twelve, my mother needed a hysterectomy – my father ran off with her
nurse! And that’s the last I heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Al, my stepfather he’s opinionated. And you have
to listen because he’s like in a wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I like my job – I mean I’m doing all right. I’m
not sure how long I want to stay there, you know… I mean, I’m
thirty-one… I’m not sure I want to be a video store clerk when I’m
forty… Of course, I didn’t expect to be doing it ’til I was thirty-one,
either. But… you know I’m… keeping my options open. Anything comes
along, I’m ready to pounce.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: A dream? Of course I have a dream I just don’t
know what the hell it is.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: He’s who we want to go with.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: This guy.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I polled my staff. The men say they’d hang
around with him and the women say he’s fuckable. And one of the men said
he’s fuckable.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: I’m not sure about the entire
concept.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Look it’s not like we’re burning up the
airwaves now. We’re running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel. If
people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we’re a hit.
Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the
screen… and the beauty is this guy doesn’t even have to be good. I mean
if he’s good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself,
better.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Come on. People cannot turn away from an
accident. You drive by, you say “Ooh, I hope there’s not a head lying in
the road” but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This
guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive
down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see
if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family.
So let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I got your message. Way to go!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi, Shari. Let’s go in the stockroom.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. stockroom</strong>: Ed and Ray enter.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So when do you start?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I … I’m not gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look – there’s a million ways to humiliate
yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it’s all day! Every
minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh man! They couldn’t pick me! They had to pick
you!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You would do this? You would actually –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you
something –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Why do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Whenever you ask me something why do you always
say “Let me ask you something?” Why don’t you just ask me?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: All right. Let me ask you something… are you
happy like this?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m doing all right.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh Yeah? What’s your master plan here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re gonna be a video store clerk for the
rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the “Ernest”
movies?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Screw off.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How many opportunities are you going to get in
your life?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s right. You don’t know. Doors don’t fly
open for guys like us.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey. You know– we’re not the same. I got a good
life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, don’t bullshit a bullshitter. If you’re
happy like this you’re an idiot, and you’re not an idiot. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Oh. I – I heard Ray yelling. 1 didn’t mean to
–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Give me a chance. I’m begging you. I need a
break. Look, I’11 cover your ass. I’11 ride shotgun. Just bring those
cameras over to me and I’11 make something happen for both of us. I
swear. Come on, Eddie</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is this guy a brother?!</p>
<p><strong>14 int. restaurant - night</strong>: Moderate-priced,
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What happens when you go to the bathroom? Do
they go in with you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to
sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back
on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What if–you’re vomiting?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What if I’m vomiting?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Do they show it?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I guess – I don’t – it’s all in the contract.
There’s this million-page contract –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look, can we all just sign the releases so we
can get on with this?</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: What happened? You described this
“crazy-kooky” family who’d be a million laughs on TV?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! I barely even mentioned -it’s just that, my
friends, the people at work, whoever I’m regularly in contact with they
want releases from.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: They’re gonna mock our foibles.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Our what?</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: Our foibles, our foibles!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We don’t have foibles.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country
sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have… mocked foibles.</p>
<p><strong>jeantte</strong>: Eddie, please don’t let them mock our
foibles.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Stop saying foibles!</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: Look, my life is not so great, that I want
it shown on television. And neither is yours.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s the point – this could change
things.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: For instance… me and my friend Bucky are buying
out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: What does that have to do with… ?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets
a balloon payment.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I borrow against that now, at the bank. Buy the
business. And Ed becomes a silent partner. Now here’s the beauty part.
While we’re on TV I plug the shit out of the business. Free
advertising.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: How about sex?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’11 have to pass, Al. And it’s not an age thing
–</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: No! Do they show you having sex?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it’s
actual sex they have to cut away.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: At what point?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: At the point – I don’t – Look you’d be on TV
maybe one or two times each. I’11 try to avoid I’11 go out of my way to
avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>15 int. ed’s apartment - day</strong>: A WORKMAN is drilling
a hole in the wall.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Are you sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey, believe me -1 know I’ve got a great chance
of making a fool of myself, here.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Why do it?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I saw this show once. It was about logging. I
was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up
really bad log jams? You know, when they’re really tangled… ?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Cream rinse?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So maybe this is my dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Dynamite is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ed, can I see you a second.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Okay, so you understand? We’re installing a
permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living
room, plus, of course, there’ll always be a couple of steady-cams
following you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I want you to take this.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: That has my work number, my home number, my
pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to
talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Um, yeah – thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Now look. Don’t freeze up on me. I picked
you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You’re
not going to lose that, are you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, uh…</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I bet my career on you. You’d better be
good.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Don’t say that. That’s like… telling a guy
before you have sex you’d better be good. You don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>16 int. ed’s bedroom - night</strong>: He’s in bed, watching
TV. The news is on. He glances up at one of the cameras. On the news,
they go to a story about him.</p>
<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: Tomorrow morning, the cable
channel known as Real TV, begins broadcasting one of the most heavily
promoted concepts in the history of cable television. In an experiment
that they say will last at least a month. They’re going to follow – live
- every waking minute of a thirty-one year old video store clerk from
Paramus New Jersey. The Real TV press release on this promises that none
of it will be scripted, none of it will be edited and in my opinion,
none of it will be interesting. we’re all just supposed to sit in front
of our TV’s and watch this guy… live.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: What would be the interest here? What would…
get people to tune in?</p>
<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: Betas me.</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: I don’t know. I might check it out.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Well, Len’s here to check out sports. Len,
would you watch this video clerk?</p>
<p><strong>len</strong>: I’d sooner watch soccer.</p>

<p><strong>32 int. office</strong>: Cynthia is ON the PHONE.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Get him out of the house! I want him

<p><strong>director</strong>: Hey, I want him dead, but what can I
do.</p>

<p><strong>35 int. control truck</strong>: The Director is still on the

Relax, man.” Carlos WINKS. This does help Ed. He appreciates it. He
drives.</p>

errands. A little shopping – a little banking – always ON CAMERA. At one
point, he WALKS INTO a GLASS DOOR with the word “Pull” on it. He pushed,

that’s doing no business.</p>

a camera. Some know what it’s about some don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Welcome to work, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, Jesus, I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Carlos, give him some air, give him some
room. Use a longer lens. We’11 mostly go with the stationary cameras in
here. Less intrusive. Have any of you thought about your next
career?</p>
<p><strong>40 int. a kitchen - same time</strong>: A WOMAN is serving
dinner. She’s watching Ed on TV – really just glancing at it. Her
HUSBAND is helping her bring the food to the table.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Why are we watching this?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: No reason. just… I just want to see what
happens.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Nothing’s gonna happen. He’s just…
working.</p>

is shooting Ed in the bathroom CLIPPING his TOENAILS</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Some guys work from the big toe down to the
little toe. Not me. I save the big one for last. That’s the one I really

people’s nails?</p>
<p><strong>43 int. ray’s apartment</strong>: Ray and Shari watching Ed.

alone. She’s ON the PHONE. She’s coming apart.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No, I haven’t seen the spot ratings…</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I think that’s a number from which we can
hopefully, uh… build…</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I disagree… No, I am not ready to pull the

boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s living with her!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ray, maybe this isn’t …</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, this is great. You’ll love this. He’s a
singer.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Marcia’s living with a singer?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and
sings. That’s how they met.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: He sang to her and they fell in love?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No! Some drunk hit him over the head with his

Marcia yanked a big hunk of glass out of his head.</p>

bar in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ray –</p>

<p><strong>ray</strong>: Richie! She spent six months dating a
criminal</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: She didn’t know he was a criminal. They had a
relationship. They –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: “Quick pull off the highway” is not a
relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What are you, hiding from the Police? Show your
face, you look great. Doesn’t she look great.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: While I’m gone, tell them about our cousin
Lenny who’s gay. We knew from when he was five.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You do though, you look great.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, no, I – as soon as you came in tonight I
said to John, “Boy Shari looks beautiful.” I said it on TV so you can
ask anybody who saw it.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better
than she likes the brother.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You’re nuts.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Okay, I’m nuts.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Give me the remote.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Just a few more minutes. Read your book.</p>
<p><strong>first guy</strong>: What do you like about it? I don’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>second guy</strong>: I don’t know – it just it’s I don’t

Carlos.</p>
<p><strong>53 int. ed’s apartment</strong>: Ed is at his kitchen table
with several burly DEMONSTRATORS arrayed behind him. Ed is NERVOUSLY,
READING from a sheet of paper while Carlos shoots.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: … my “Polish acrobat” remark was ill-considered.
Although, I meant no harm, I should have recognized that such
stigmatizing remarks bring pain and anguish to…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I can’t read my own writing. It’s like Chinese –
It’s not like Chinese! Chinese is, I’m sure, a beautiful language and
they write … beautifully. It’s not Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Jesus, I’m sweating like a Mexican fruit-picker.
Oh, Christ!</p>
<p><strong>54 int. dental office</strong>: A YOUNG DENTAL HYGIENIST is
cleaning Ed’s teeth. The camera is practically right in his mouth. It’s
making the Hygienist NERVOUS. She’s distracted. She hurts Ed. He
SCREAMS. She SCREAMS. She drops her tools.</p>
<p><strong>hygienist</strong>: Can I have some room please?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Gi hu roo.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. tv studio</strong>: It’s an educational-type panel
discussion involving various eggheads and pundits. It’s called
“Viewpoint.”</p>
<p><strong>moderator</strong>: Let’s change topics for a moment. Does
anybody have a viewpoint on something going on now called “Ed TV”.</p>
<p><strong>panel member #1</strong>: This, I believe, is a new low point
in American culture.</p>
<p><strong>panel member #2</strong>: I agree. What it reveals is the
absolute creative bankruptcy in the television business. What they’re
saying, basically, is “We’re giving up. We have no ideas.”</p>
<p><strong>panel member #3</strong>: It’s worse than that! They don’t
select someone with any talent, or with something to say – they seem to
celebrate the fact that this guy is a boob. It’s a joyous celebration of
boobery.</p>
<p><strong>panel member #4</strong>: I think we’ve already spent far too
much time discussing this.</p>
<p><strong>56 int. chinese restaurant - night</strong>: OPEN ON Ray with
chopsticks up his nose, imitating a walrus. Also, he has lo mein noodles

number.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. real tv office</strong>: Cynthia is alone working
late. She’s drinking. She’s watching Ray. She’s not enjoying him.</p>

<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Choke to death, you boring bastard.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. ews bedroom - night</strong>: Ed is sitting up in
bed, wearing shorts and a tee-shirt, eating directly out of a cereal
box.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: The audience likes you when you’re
moving.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yes. Try not to stay in one place too long.
Get outside as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Also, we have some notions. Have you thought
about becoming a Big Brother?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Or coaching a Little League team?</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: How about a date?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: No, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: It’s just, the ratings are still soft.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Are you going to cancel me?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Let’s not worry about that vet.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re testing well.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: There’s another problem.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: It’s … Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What about Ray?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Well, the walrus impression - delightful as it
was – is just not wowing the audience. This is some audience
research.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: It means they hate his freaking guts. It
means if he were on fire they wouldn’t put him out.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He’s just … trying a little too hard –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ed, the audience can smell the desperation
coming through the screen.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Could you… see him a little less often?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How much less?</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Never would be plenty.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I can’t do that to him. He’s pushing a little
too hard - but… I just can’t do that to him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He’11 be fine.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. car - day</strong>: “DAY FIVE”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What the –?!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I’m on TV! I’m on TV!</p>

at him.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Ed! Your show stinks!</p>

the bell.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is Ray’s apartment. Ray’s got a big-screen

He’s really a good guy. He just…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s me, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You watching the ballgame?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Uh, no, uh I’m a little tired. I fell
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh. All right. I’11 watch at home, then.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ray, where do you keep the glasses?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, is Shari here? Why didn’t you just say so?
Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi, Shari.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Who’s Shari?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who’s –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hello… Shari, hi… Oh no! … Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We’d better go…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, honey, it’s not what it looks like–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh God … Ed!</p>
<p><strong>64 int. hallway</strong>: Ed is TIP-TOEING away. He stops
when Ray calls him. Ray ’runs out into the hallway after him. They speak
with lowered voices.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That was Shari. She saw the whole thing on
TV–</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What is this? What’s going on, who is that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s the receptionist at one of the places I
service video equipment – she’s very pretty and, you know, she never
even talks to me and then today I come in and she’s all “I saw you on TV
the other night… You were so great …” Next thing I know we’re …</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Next thing you know! Why didn’t you stop?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stop? I’m a guy. I don’t stop. The woman’s
supposed to stop. We’re the gas, they’re the brakes.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ray, I finished the Snapple.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fine!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Is there more?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: In the cabinet, but it’s warm. There’s ice in
the tray. I Talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t even know her. All I know is she likes
Snapple.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to
her</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes! Go!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You brought the cameras here!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You brought the girl!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: If I go over to Shari, the camera’s going there,
too.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s good. She’11 – you know control herself.
Look. If I go over there, she’s just gonna slam the door on me. Just go
over and beg her to talk to me, that’s all. Please. You owe me for
this!</p>
<p><strong>67 int. another hallway- night</strong>: The door opens,
revealing RITA, Shari’s roommate.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Um… Shari knew you were coming over because
she saw …</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Right, yeah –</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She really doesn’t want you and the camera in
here right now.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, I understand. That’s - where is she, is she
all right?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I … gave her a drink. I thought it … but she’s
not much of a drinker, so it’s made her a little… belligerent.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: What do you want?!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Shari, I’m just really sorry. Look, I know this
is… unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and –
you know – just say… two words, then…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Don’t lose them, Carlos. This is gold.
Stay out of their way, but get everything.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. shari’s apartment</strong>: Carlos settles across the
room. He rests the camera down as if he’s not even shooting, but he’s
still guiding it where he wants it throughout the scene.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m gonna go to bed. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Hi, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Shari, Ray feels –</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Don’t defend that horse’s ass to me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m not. I’m not. I’m just Look – you know, in a
way, it’s good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it’s not
worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something
–</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Ha!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay …</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I’ve got news for you– I never intended to
marry him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh… how come?</p>
<p><strong>70 int. ray’s apartment</strong>: Ray, watching on TV.</p>

<p><strong>73 int. shari’s apartment</strong>: Ed realizes that Ray’s

<p><strong>shari</strong>: I mean bad.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, not having been there… I just think you’re
hurt and you’re saying this to, you know, get back at him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look… whether you get back together or not,
you’re too terrific a person to… lower yourself like this.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. ray’s apartment</strong>: Ray, still in shock.</p>

in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies,
it’s … They know what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: This is real, Bananahead!</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: So?</p>

see her?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I wanted to! I was dying to! But…</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Is it Ray? The audience hates Ray. Females, 18
to 35 –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, I don’t need to hear that. Cynthia?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yes, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Could we just talk alone for a second? I –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Good idea. Could you all leave us alone for

me to school in orange corduroy pants.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Uh-huh?</p>

Ass.” “Hey Pumpkin Ass,” – for like a year. So, now, I feel like
everyone’s watching me and, you know, I’m “Pumpkin Ass” again.</p>

<p><strong>woman</strong>: That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on
to him honey.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: By the X.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Some more make-up wouldn’t do you any harm.
On TV you look a little washed out.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: What would I actually have to do to get you
to sign this?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, an TV a minute and already an
attitude.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: By the X. That’s were two lines cross –
forming an X.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know, I never saw you in your uniform
before.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Yeah, well…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s really a tremendous turnoff.</p>

rains.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sunday night at the Devils game, I’m driving the
Zamboni.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: The what?</p>

ice.</p>

<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s quite an honor. Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, I know this is weird. But… I don’t want to

spotted.</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. rock club - a few minutes later</strong>: BOUNCERS

<p><strong>101 int. ed’s kitchen - day</strong>: Ed is ON the PHONE.</p>

The cameras are close.</p>
<p><strong>105 int. tv news show- three weeks later</strong>: Written on
the screen – “Day 26.”</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Well, welve had pet rocks, hula hoops, Davy
Crockett, Beatle wigs, and leisure suits. But America’s latest craze is
a guy named Ed. Here with that story is entertainment reporter, Rick
Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: Pat, four weeks ago, no one
in America had even heard of Ed Pekurny. Today, this thirty-one year-old
video store clerk has become something of a national obsession. The
words viewers use to describe him are “charming,” “natural,” and
“appealing.” And ratings indicate that “Ed TV” is being watched by more
people, each day, than any show in the history of cable television.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: This idea just came to me. I told my
staff – if people just tune in twice a day for five minutes we’re a hit.
Sometimes you gotta go with your gut feeling.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. cynthia’s office</strong>: She’s watching. She’s
ANGRY.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Sure it came to you! Because I brought it
to you! You want a gut feeling?! How about a groin feeling?!</p>
<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: Ed TV has become so popular
that when Ed goes to sleep Real TV is running highlights of Ed’s day all
night. Some viewers have become obsessed with Ed. They wake up when Ed
wakes up, they go to sleep when Ed goes to sleep, and in between they
try to watch as much of him as possible.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Yeah, I watch it… More than I’d like to
admit sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Never… no…</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: Honestly? … I try not to go to the
bathroom until Ed goes to the bathroom so I won’t miss anything.</p>
<p><strong>ice cream guy</strong>: Watch this! Like Ed.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: I just kind of leave it an, you know, so
it’s… there.</p>
<p><strong>teen-ager #2</strong>: I like her. She’s sweet.</p>
<p><strong>teen-ager #1</strong>: She just rubs me the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>teen-ager #3</strong>: I’m so glad they got rid of Ray. He
was creepy.</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: To me, this Shari is like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>guy #2</strong>: She’s not even hot. I mean Ed’s a celebrity.
If that was me, I’d be dating the goods.</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: There’s something wrong with her. She’s
definitely not hot.</p>
<p><strong>guy #2</strong>: Not hot. Not.</p>
<p><strong>107 int. shari’s apartment</strong>: She’s watching this,
wearing a bathrobe. Her self-esteem is being crushed.</p>
<p><strong>108 int. tv studio</strong>: This is an “E TV” kind of gossip
show. The host – a YOUNG WOMAN – is showing film of Ed and Shari getting
out of Ed’s car. The film freeze-frames. Shari has an unflattering look
on her face.</p>
<p><strong>gossip queen</strong>: What’s wrong with her! Everytime you
look at this chick, it’s like she badly needs a Tampax. Ed, you can do
better.</p>
<p><strong>109 int. delicatessan - night</strong>: Ed and Shari are on a
date. A WAITRESS is taking their order. Shari still seems a little
self-conscious, but Ed is having a ball.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’11 have… Get this – I’11 have the “Ed.”</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I’m stunned.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Pekurny. I’m sorry to bother you. My son
would just love to have your autograph.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No problema. You want a picture?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Moe.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Take this around the corner to Frame World,
they’ll give you a discount.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh – Sunday is good for me to meet your folks.
We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: That’s lucky.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Saturday, I think we should</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Compliments of Motorola. Hello… Marcia?? My
sister. – What? … What, right now? … I’m eating, I’m on a date! … Well,
where’s your boyfriend – what’s his name? Cliff …. Then, call a cab… All
right. Look, just don’t start any trouble okay. Just sit there quietly
’til I get there… you’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This used to be a regular thing. And the worst
part, is while she’d be waiting for me to come down to some bar and get
her, she’d start up with some guy and say “Wait ’til my brother gets
here, he’11 kick your ass.” So then I walk in and there’s some
rhinoceros in a windbreaker who tries to shove me into a shot glass. And
Marcia’s drunk and screaming “Kick his ass, Ed. Kick his ass.” I think
this is it.</p>
<p><strong>111 int. bar</strong>: It’s not a seedy dive. Ed and Shari
and the camera operators enter. A CUSTOMER approaches.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You’re the guy on
TV.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What was the tip-off? The enormous camera?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: See, like you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh great.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: Ed.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hm? I’m, uh… Why isn’t this drunken woman
you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s going on? Why did you want me to come
down here?</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: Cliff is here. He’s performing. I wanted you
to see him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh! Oh – okay, now I get it. It’s “Star Search.”
You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: Ed, he needs a break. You don’t know what
kind of bad luck he’s had –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do
with this. You swore to me. “Don’t come near me. Don’t bring this into
my life…”</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: For God sakes, you said two words about some
lousy pizza joint, the guy’s a millionaire now. This could be my whole
future we’re talking about. Hi, I’m Ed’s sister.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I’ve heard so much about you.</p>
<p><strong>112 int. bar - later</strong>: Cliff is in the middle of his
show.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I wish my stepfather was here.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He could give me some oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>113 int. shari’s apartment - later</strong>: Ed and Shari are
KISSING.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Oh boy! Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Euuw…</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I told you. If we… you know do it, they go away
until … we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I know, but even if they go away, everybody
in America knows what we’re doing because… they went away.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So? What do they think – we’re not kids –</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I know, I …</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Shari, I really like you…</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I really like you too…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: …if this … … weren’t here… ?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: … yeah, then, but…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So…?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Ed… I think we should stop seeing each
other.</p>

anymore. He’s a celebrity. We’re no longer observing anyone’s “real
life.”</p>
<p><strong>panel member #2</strong>: But that’s what’s interesting! The
effect of celebrity on an otherwise average person.</p>
<p><strong>panel member #3</strong>: But do you really feel that Ed is
an average person? I mean this guy seems to have a… magnetism, a
charisma that, I think, transcends the entire concept.</p>
<p><strong>panel member #4</strong>: I agree. He’s special.</p>
<p><strong>120 int. ews apartment - day</strong>: ” DAY 34 ”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is from a girl named Tawny… this goes in
the nude picture pile. Thank you, Tawny.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well. This is creative. This goes in the
psychopath pile.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, I hope that’s not this guy.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: You don’t recognize me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. Am I supposed to?</p>
<p><strong>121 int. ews mother’s house</strong>: Jeanette is putting a
jar in the refrigerator. She glances at the television. She drops the
jar. It SHATTERS…</p>
<p><strong>122 int. marcia’s apartment</strong>: Marcia is with her
half-Asian son ANDY. She’s serving his dinner. OFF-CAMERA we HEAR Cliff
SINGING and the DOG HOWLING in distress. Glancing at the television,
Marcia gasps.</p>
<p><strong>123 int. ray’s apartment</strong>: Ray is TYPING on a word
processor. He stares curiously at the television.</p>
<p><strong>124 int. ed’s apartment</strong>: Ed is staring at Hank
doubtfully.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: It’s me, Hank – your father.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. real tv office</strong>: The Real TV staff react.
Cynthia looks over– stunned.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Did you do this? Did you find him and get him
to–</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: No way… Oh, this just keeps getting
better.</p>
<p><strong>126 int. al and jeanette’s house - day</strong>: Written on
the screen – “Day 35”</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: I can’t believe you’re taking his
side.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m not! I’m just trying to get some facts.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Sign this one to Nancy. She’s the nurse who
handles my urine.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: I told you the facts! He abandoned us –
those are the facts.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So everything he told me yesterday was a lie.
Everything.</p>
<p><strong>jeantette</strong>: Yes! … practically</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you mean practically? Did he really run
away or did you throw him out like he says.</p>
<p><strong>repairman</strong>: I need to replace the coil.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: He ran away after I threw him out. How
much is a new coil?</p>
<p><strong>repairman</strong>: A hundred and fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So he was telling the truth you threw him
out.</p>
<p><strong>repairman</strong>: Should I go ahead?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes to me or yes to the coil?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Both.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Holy sh–</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: This one to Dr. Bamajian. Maybe he won’t make me
wait an hour.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: He had girlfriends!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He says –</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: I don’t care what he says. Look, I don’t
need to relive this. On television!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers.
Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, so… ?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: They celebrated the common person.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, I don’t think you can get more common than
me, Al.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a
mailman on the cover of a magazine he’d better have killed someone or no
one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: All right – do you want to know the truth?
I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister’s on the train for the
weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and
there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Chicken pox? I was six. He didn’t leave ’til I
was twelve.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: He… apologized, he begged me. He can be
very… charming when it suits his purpose.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But what was that whole story about him and a
nurse?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: She could’ve been a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Could’ve been a nurse?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: She had white shoes.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O’Neal. You
told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The difference is for twenty years I thought one
thing and now it’s another thing.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: He was no good. Do you remember how he
used to scream at me? You used to cover your ears with dinner rolls.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Also, no job was ever good enough for him.
“Small potatoes, small potatoes.” Al, you remember –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wait a minute. I thought you didn’t know Al,
’til after Dad left.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh my God. You and Al were - and that’s why you
threw him out.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare
you call him “Dad” in front of Al. This is your father. This is who was
there for you when you needed someone.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Jeanette, you’re hurting me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m not – I didn’t – Al, you know how I feel
about you…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: If I don’t call you “Dad” it’ just because… 1
was already a big boy when you came into our lives – or when I thought
you came into our lives –</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: And what did he come back now for?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you’re
famous and he can get something from you. I don’t wan you to become a
victim like Marcia. Not that you’re a victim, honey. You’re not. Life’s
just been a little hard on you, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you think. I mean about… him. Should I
just… have nothing to do with him? I mean…</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Have I ever said a bad word to you about your
father?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean,
son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: But he was your father.</p>
<p><strong>127 int. ed’s bedroom - night</strong>: He’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. control truck</strong>: They’re monitoring him. They
see Ed WAKE UP. They stir. Sleepy, and scratching his ass, he goes into
the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>129 int. bathroom</strong>: Ed shuts the door. He takes his
PORTABLE PHONE OUT of a bathroom drawer. He makes a call and waits.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi… it’s me, Ed. It’s been two days, I want to
see you… No, I won’t let them follow me, I’11 sneak out… No it’s not
allowed, but I’m going for it… I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>130 int. control truck</strong>: They’re monitoring the empty
bed.</p>
<p><strong>131 int. bathroom</strong>: Ed is dressed. He CLIMBS OUT his

<p><strong>132 int. shari’s apartment - later</strong>: Shari opens her
front door.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: They’re not here.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I tried to tell you over the phone – my
parents went to Atlantic City.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: So my little brother’s staying here. I’m
sleeping with Rita.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh Je – couldn’t he sleep with Rita? We’11 all
have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. ed’s car - a few minutes later</strong>: They get
in. They look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Do you want to go to a motel?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I feel like a criminal or, like we’re
cheating on someone.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Just… just relax. Okay? We won’t do anything.
We’11 just sit here for a while.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: She lied to me. I mean all my life, she’s
telling me one story and then… it turns out to be a completely different
story. Come to me at some point – tell me the truth. No. Not in my
house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the
way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no
problem with herself - “How do they find me” she says. Ray cheats on you
and then blames me for it. I’m the only one in the family who takes any
responsibility for himself… Oh, man… Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Yeah… I saw that girl come on to you at the
TV show.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh that was… no, I … she just kind of trapped me
into giving her a ride. It’s you. I want you.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: …yeah?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Good morning. Welcome to another day of
Ed TV. Last night, while most of us were asleep … this happened.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. frat house - morning</strong>: FOUR GUYS in a
disgustingly messy room, watching the replay of Ed and Shari.</p>
<p><strong>frat guys</strong>: Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. street - day</strong>: Shari is working. Ed is
following her around. Shari is ANGRY. The cameras are there.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Get them away from me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s not their fault.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: No. It’s your fault.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What do you want me to do? You want me to quit
the show?!</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: No… Could you?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. If I quit I don’t get the balloon
payment.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against
this balloon payment that I don’t get if I qu – it’s too complicated. I
– Besides…</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You see how people look at me. Like when they
ask for my autograph or say “Hi” to me… It’s like I’m a basketball
player or a… you know, like I’m someone.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Everybody’s someone.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, yeah, everybody’s someone. But I mean
someone they want to be. I mean let’s face it, I’m working in the video
store, no one’s coming in saying “oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was
rewinding that huge pile of tapes.” At least for a month I’m not just a
guy with a name tag. I’m famous.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Shari! Nice nipples.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And so are you.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: I don’t want to be famous for getting caught
with my shirt off. If I’m going to be famous –</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: This is going right up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: Look… maybe we just better put us on hold
until this is over.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Come on! Loosen up. See – this is why
seventy-one per cent of the people don’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It was a joke! A… vicious, thoughtless stupid
joke.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And that, for you kids out there, is how you
screw up a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>137 int. ed’s apartment</strong>: Ed enters. He’s worn out.
He plops down, and puts on the TV.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m gonna watch anything but me.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Coming in two weeks to the Lifestyle
Channel – Joma. His Dad’s a cop, his brother’s a bouncer in a topless
bar, his sister is a black-belt social worker – and Joma’s living with
two gals.</p>
<p><strong>joma</strong>: Hey, Ed! I’m coming to get you, man! I’m gonna
eat you right up!</p>
<p><strong>138 int. network conference room - day</strong>: They’re
watching a tape of Ed TV. Ed has just entered his own apartment. A WOMAN
is there, sitting on his sofa. She’s caressing Ed’s undershorts against
her cheek. Ed is highly agitated.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How did you get into my apartment?!</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: A pair of Ed’s underwear.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No – keep it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I love you! 1 want to marry you!</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: See – that’s television! This other
thing, this Jama, that has “stink” written all over it.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: The break-up with Shari was very big. Big
ratings.</p>
<p><strong>seaver</strong>: Only, Cynthia, seriously. Tell Ed not to
sneak out anymore.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Cynthia …</p>
<p><strong>seaver</strong>: It’s in violation of his contract and if we
wanted to be hard-nosed about it, he could forfeit all pay, including
money he’s already received.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I will see that he’s properly
threatened.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Now what? What’s on the young man’s
agenda? We don’t want to see him sitting around like a lovesick
puppy.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Young males do not want to see Ed get back
with Shari.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Enough with her. That sailed.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: You know who the audience is requesting a lot?
That girl, Jill, that Ed met at the Letterman show. She really
scored.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Cynthia…</p>
<p><strong>139 ext. street - day</strong>: Ed is walking from his car to
a building. CROWDS are behind barricades. They YELL at Ed as he passes.
Ed is used to this.</p>
<p><strong>140 int. shari’s building - day</strong>: Rita OPENS the door
and sees Ed.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh. Ed.</p>

<p><strong>ed</strong>: What is she, at work?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She left.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, when will she be back?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give
her a transfer and she left. She couldn’t stand it anymore. We had
people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going
through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn’t take it
anymore. Now I’ve got to move. I can’t afford this place by myself.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m sorry. Where’d they send her?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She wouldn’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>141 int. ed’s bedroom - night</strong>: He’s off the air.
He’s a little down. He’s ON the PHONE-</p>
<p><strong>142 int. cynthia’s bedroom</strong>: She’s working out an a
contraption.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Remember when you were interviewing me?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You asked me if I had a dream. I said “Sure, I
have a dream. I just don’t know what it is yet.”</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Great line.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What if Shari’s the dream?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ed, do you want my advice?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, that’s why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex
would tell me where she moved –</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Leave her be.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You said a woman likes to be pursued.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space.
Can I tell you something – as a friend? My sister was going with a guy
they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got
back together and last month they had their third child For what it’s
worth.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Throw me a high one, Uncle Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh!!</p>

<p><strong>ed</strong>: She went out to California and got one of those
scandal agents. One of those agents who handle, like… Gennifer Flowers
and… Kato Kaelin and Joey Buttafuco. That’s what she –</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey Ed! … She was a little too much for you,
huh? Must run in the family.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh – like this guy’s ever been with a woman. How
about I kick your ass ’til the crack goes the other way? All of a

<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, man! So…</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: The last two years, I’ve been a limousine
driver, but I don’t see well anymore, so…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So you saw me on TV and you said “Hey, let me
jump on this.”</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I need help. How many times if just one little
thing that I needed would’ve happened, it would’ve changed everything.
If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or… the tumblers
just never clicked for me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: All right… This is my father, I don’t know what
the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him – get him a job
- I’11 … help you. I’11 … mention your business or … I don’t know, we’11
figure it out. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Ed… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah? That’s good. Sorry is good. You know I
finished that model.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: What…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The pirate ship.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: – That we were doing “together.” I finished it.
It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder
bothering me - “That’s too much glue. You’re using too much glue.”</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Do you still have it?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. Ray sat on it. I’11 see you.</p>
<p><strong>167 int. tv studio</strong>: The same PBS-type panel of
smart-looking people we met earlier. WE OPEN ON about half the
panel.</p>
<p><strong>moderator</strong>: Let’s hear from our guest panelist.
You’ve expressed some interesting thoughts on this, subject. What do you
see as the meaning, if there is any, of Ed TV, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I feel that Ed is the apotheosis of a
prevailing American syndrome. It used to be that someone became famous
because they were special. Now people are considered special just for
being famous. Fame, itself, is now a moral good in this country. It’s
its own virtue.</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: I was Ed’s Little League coach. He had no
coordination. The big game, he struck cut with the bases loaded. Then he
cried like a woman. It was sickening.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I was his third grade teacher. I said
“Take him for tests. There’s something wrong with him.” They didn’t
listen.</p>
<p><strong>another guy</strong>: He used to steal things from my store.
At least I think it was him. Yeah, it was probably him.</p>
<p><strong>168 ext. ed’s apartment - day</strong>: A MAN, on the
sidewalk, has a STUFFED CAT stuck to his back to tease Ed.</p>
<p><strong>cat man</strong>: Hey, look, I just fell off a table!</p>
<p><strong>169 int. ed’s apartment - continuous</strong>: Ed at the
window, with a now empty plastic tub.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay, is that funny?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How was that? Was that funny?!</p>
<p><strong>170 int. network office</strong>: “DAY 78”</p>
<p><strong>honcho #1</strong>: Of more concern than the sag in Ed’s
ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now. The positives are
down and the negatives are up. There’s a feeling that Ed isn’t cool
anymore. We’re starting to see a big L.F.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>honcho #1</strong>: L.F. Loser Factor.</p>
<p><strong>honcho #2</strong>: That’s deadly.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Isn’t this getting kind of pathetic. I mean
we drank the juice, now we’re just licking peel. Let it go!</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Cynthia, I think you’re laboring under a
misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict
this, we should be impressed. We’re not. Anybody in any business can
predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this
thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your
baby.</p>
<p><strong>171 int. bar - night</strong>: “DAY 94” Tad and Barry – as we
met them, originally – are watching TV. They’re really enjoying it –
laughing, pounding the table.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: I don’t know, I still love this guy.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah only I wish they had the sister on
more.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Ooh, the sister! She is hot.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>joma’s friend</strong>: Ignore him.</p>
<p><strong>joma</strong>: I can’t! It’s like a mudslide. Put on a
shirt!</p>
<p><strong>joma</strong>: I support the fact that your exercising but,
for the love of God, put on a shirt.</p>
<p><strong>joma’s friend</strong>: Shut the curtains.</p>
<p><strong>joma</strong>: No! Let him shut the curtains.</p>
<p><strong>172 int. ed’s bedroom</strong>: Off the air. Ed ON the
PHONE.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This Joma is so phoney! I mean, those things
aren’t really happening. I think they have writers making that stuff up
for him. Hey, couldn’t we do that? Hire some writers and have them write
up some crazy situations I could get into?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ed, everything goes off. “Cheers” went off.
“Mash” went off –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, but when they went off people weren’t
making fun of them. They weren’t bozos! I’m Pumpkin Ass again!</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ed –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I
call you for advice about Shari you say - “Leave her be, see other
people for a while.” You just wanted me to get involved with Jill
because it made for a better show.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Ed –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No. You screwed up my life just so you could get
higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: Yeah? Well I’m not starting now.</p>
<p><strong>173 int. pool hall - night</strong>: Ed and John are
playing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, you put anybody on TV sixteen hours a
day, at some point they’re going to wind up rolling off a table on to a
cat. I mean with no privacy, there’s no… dignity.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know about that fireman who rescued that
little girl?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When? Today?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby…
Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh right, right! She fell down, like a…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on
TV and there was a parade and a movie about him</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right, right…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And then, uh… you know it blew over and he went
back to being a fireman again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So he killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: I’m at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s the matter?!</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: He’s dead! Eddie, he’s dead! It was his
heart.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh God. What hospital?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: St. Joseph’s.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m coming right over. I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>174 int. tad’s house</strong>: Tad is watching TV and talking
an the phone.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: I told you! I told you he was gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>175 int. hospital - an hour later</strong>: Ed rushes in. He
goes up to the desk. Carlos is with him.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi. I’m looking for my mother. Her name is –</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: Mr. Pekurny.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: I’m Dr. Geller. Your mother is just
lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her
down.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Thank you. Can I see her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: Just wait here. She’s coming right back
out.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Mm… Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What about him – did he suffer any or was it
quick? I’d hate to think he…</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: Very quick. Between you and me, it’s not
a bad way to go. Making love to your wife… it’s very sweet.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Really? They were..</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: According to your mother. When the
paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: I … don’t know. I …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Eddie. Thank God you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: How’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Al!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Our neighbors gave me a ride.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Al!!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Where is she? Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I thought – I thought he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Al!</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: No. The deceased is … Henry Pekurny.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: Good twist!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You thought it was me?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: It’s your father. Hank. Your mother went to see
him and he had a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Went –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. geller</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Could I get your autograph for my niece?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Um… yeah…</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Al! How did you –</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: The Burkharts drove me. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: I’m fine. I …</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Good. I gotta pee.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: It was horrible. He called me up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to
apologize for everything he begged – he cried. So I went to this
horrible hotel he was staying in… I felt so sorry for him –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So you had sex with him?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: The doctor said you were having sex.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: To you? In front of him? With the…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Oh my god! On TV!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Why? How…</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: One thing led to another. He was my
husband once.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But Al is your husband now!</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Do you think it’s been easy for me? It’s
been years. Al can’t have sex.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did
you do to him?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: “Lovely Rita, the Meter Maid…</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Don’t tell Al. He doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, he’s the only one in America who
doesn’t!</p>
<p><strong>oprah</strong>: Women who remarry but have sex with their
first husbands. on today’s Oprah.</p>
<p><strong>179 int. tv studio</strong>: Our same panel of pundits.</p>
<p><strong>panelist #3</strong>: Ed’s family is the tip of the iceberg.
You watch the daytime tabloid shows it’s the same thing. I’m telling
you, America is fast becoming a trailer park.</p>
<p><strong>panelist #2</strong>: Let’s not overstate the case. There are
millions of hard- working, sensible, moral, educated people in this
country. Not every family is like Ed’s.</p>
<p><strong>180 int. tv studio</strong>: DAVE OR JAY</p>
<p><strong>dave/jay</strong>: So let’s recap. The mother’s too good at
it, both brothers stink at it. The stepfather can’t do it at all and the
father did it but it killed him. How did this family ever reproduce in
the first place?</p>
<p><strong>181 ext. cemetery gates - day</strong>: Ed is driving
Jeanette and Al to the funeral. A CROWD is held back by POLICE. Someone
yells “Adulterer”. Someone else tries to offer Ed a lunchbox. Someone
else is carrying a sign “What a Way to Go”.</p>
<p><strong>182 ext. cemetery - day</strong>: Hank’s COFFIN is being
carried to his gravesite. Ed, Ray and Marcia are pall bearers. One of
the others pall bearers is Ed’s BODYGUARD. The OTHERS TWO are two guys
who work for the mortuary. Carlos is shooting.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’re not going to talk to me? You’re not even
gonna say hello?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I have nothing to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How are you doing? Is Cliff here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cliff left her, thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Me?!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s right. You put Cliff on television. So
then he decided he was too good for her and he left.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I put his – who – Look, Marsh, he’s not that
good a singer, he’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>marcia</strong>: That’s not funny!!</p>
<p><strong>183 ext. gravesite - a little later</strong>: The service
ends. The small group begins to walk away. Ray and Marcia go off
together, ignoring Ed. Jeanette is attempting to wheel Al away from the
grave, but she’s hitting ruts. Ed approaches.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’11 take it.</p>
<p><strong>jeantte</strong>: Sweetheart, I’m gonna go ahead and sign all
the papers.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is
there anything I can –</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I’m moving out.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I’m going to be living with my brother. He’s not
in such good shape as I am, but… I’m looking forward to the pillow
fights.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh, Al … This is just…</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Hank was always good with the ladies. Always
good-looking. Hell, he’s been dead for two days, he still looks better
than me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I want to tell you something… I love you. You’re
my father.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I’11 build a pirate ship with you.</p>
<p><strong>184 int. cynthia’s office</strong>: She’s watching. She’s
genuinely moved. She wipes her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>185 int. bar - night</strong>: This place is sleazy. Ed
enters, worn out. He crosses to the bar where we find, Jeanette nursing
a drink. She’s not drunk, but she is wallowing.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Ed! How did you know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’re famous. Somebody called me. What are you
doing in a place like this?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Why shouldn’t I be in a place like this?
I’m a whore!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ma…</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: I’m a tramp Meet your new father. The
whole nation is laughing at us!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: And how is this helping? come on say, good-night
to all your new friends and let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: I’m a whore! Your bathrooms are
filthy!</p>
<p><strong>186 ext. bar - continuous</strong>: Ed is helping Jeanette.
Ray arrives. He’s ANGRY.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’11 take her. You humiliated our mother on
national television. You’ve single- handedly destroyed this family.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I – Oh, but that book you wrote was a real
love-letter. That… toilet paper with covers.</p>
<p><strong>bystander #1</strong>: That book sucked. I want my money
back.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Oh great. Where’s Moe?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Let’s remember how I got into this. “Please,
Eddie, do this for me. I can’t get a break.”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You know what your problem is?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. My problem is I’ve got a brother who
writes a sentence like “We grew up in a small, little bedroom.” As
opposed to a big, little bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you
don’t ever want anything to be your fault.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Me?! That’s you!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the
guy on TV, but you didn’t want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk
you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it’s not your
fault.</p>
<p><strong>bystander #2</strong>: Right. Like you say you love Shari,
but, you wouldn’t mind noodling that model.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Moe!</p>
<p><strong>bystander #3</strong>: The truth hurts.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah? So does a kick in the nuts.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: For once in your life, be honest with yourself.
I know you, Ed. I know you look at me and Marcia and Mom and you think
you’re different. You’re like “How did I end up in this family?” You’re
not different. you’re worse. Because you have no guts. You drift around,
you don’t commit, you make fun of me – okay. Just don’t kid yourself.
Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: You’re both good boys.</p>
<p><strong>187 int. network conference room - day</strong>: Ed is there
along with Cynthia and the Network Execs. There are more execs than
before. Cynthia’s people are not there. This entire meeting is on ED TV.
Cynthia is quiet - observing. Ed looks whipped.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Three more months?</p>
<p><strong>mr. scharlach</strong>: Absolutely! Ed TV is more popular
than ever. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>seaver</strong>: Definitely. Cynthia, explain it to him.</p>
<p><strong>seaver</strong>: I’11 do it. People want to see what happens
to them now. Do your mother and step-father get back together? How does
your sister handle being alone? Your feud with your brother.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: In fact, we have a new concept. Since
your family signed releases, we can follow them on camera even when
you’re not with them. We can cut around from family member to family
member. Whoever’s the most exciting at that moment.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: A couple of years ago my Uncle Roy got bit on
the ass by a dog.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So he gave me his tickets to the U.S. Open – the
tennis matches.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So me and Ray, we tell our friends “Watch when
Andre Agassi is gonna serve for the first time. When he’s bouncing the
ball and it’s real quiet, we’11 yell”Whoop”. And you’11 all hear
us.”</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know what that is? It’s sad. I mean it was
just so we could be heard. So we could stand out from the crowd for a
second. So we did it. But we had nothing to say. Just “Whoop”. That’s
it. And the stupid part I mean the really stupid part is we thought it
like… elevated us above the crowd. Where the fact is it made us stupider
than the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Stop saying “I see.” You don’t see. Cynthia, I
owe you an apology.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah. Because, you didn’t talk me into anything.
Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>188 int. shari’s place</strong>: Shari watching Ed TV.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Ray, you were right. It’s like in school. I was
always saying “the room was too hot, the teacher didn’t like me” – but
it was me! Everything that’s wrong with my life I did. Okay? So now this
is it. My family has problems. Which are our fault. And TV is not the
place to solve them. So I quit. I’m taking what very little dignity I’ve
got left and I quit. Can someone validate my parking?</p>
<p><strong>mr. scharlach</strong>: Well, Ed, that’s … not really
possible.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: All right, I’11 pay for the parking. Big
network!</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: No, I mean you can’t quit.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I can’t?</p>
<p><strong>mr. scharlach</strong>: Well, no. You agreed to stay on the
air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that
understanding. If you had refused we’d have begun this with somebody
else. You can’t just change the rules in the middle of the game, son.
It’s not fair to us. More importantly, it’s not fair to the viewers.
They’re interested in you. They’ve devoted hours and days and weeks of
their lives to you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, if you don’t let me out of this… I’11
just… I’11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won’t go anywhere, I
won’t do anything. What kind of show will that be?</p>
<p><strong>mr. scharlach</strong>: Not too good. That’s why it states in
your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you’re
in violation and are liable for the station’s financial losses. Ed, I
urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out
there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with
them, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: All right. Let them decide.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’d like you all to do me a favor. Turn me off.
Just grab the remote and change the channel. I mean, basically, all
you’re watching now is a guy deteriorate. The only thing missing is the
smell. You’re better than that Turn me off. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>190 int. cynthia’s office</strong>: Greg bursts in, carrying
a sheet of paper.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Ratings are up across the board. Look at this!
Men 18 to 35, women 18 to 35 …</p>
<p><strong>191 ext. street</strong>: Ed WALKING ZOMBIE-LIKE- CROWDS
SWARM.</p>
<p><strong>192 int. lawyer’s office - day</strong>: Ed is with STEVE, a
lawyer. Steve has a huge contract on his desk.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This contract you signed? … It’s a
masterpiece. Don’t go to war with these guys. You fart in the wrong
direction they can take everything you own and leave you naked by the
side of the road. You ever going to get back with that Jill? Ooh – she
was nice. Shari, I didn’t like that much
“yet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>193 int. diner - night</strong>: Ed is sitting alone, eating
lunch. He’s surrounded by cameras and shielded by BODYGUARDS.</p>
<p><strong>194 ext. street - night</strong>: Ed and Shari are walking –
on camera.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: 1 bailed. I bailed on you.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Kinda’.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: It’s what I do. I yell “Geronimo” and jump
out of a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: You weren’t able to make me feel safe or
secure – no easy job for any man, I admit – and my problem is, if I
think I’m losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told
you, I’m the love coroner.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What did you do to your hair?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and
my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>195 int. network conference room - day</strong>: Big meeting.
Many Honchos, including Scharlach and Cynthia. All but Cynthia are
focused. Cynthia looks bored.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Um… Mr. Scharlach, um – you’re not watching
TV?</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: No, Mildred, we’re working.</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: Um… Ed – and Shari are –</p>
<p><strong>seaver</strong>: Engaged?</p>
<p><strong>mildred</strong>: No. Here. They’re in the building. They’re
on their way up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hi, kids. Busy?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I just came up to pass out these Ed TV hats.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: A guy made these up for me. He spelled Ed with
two D’s. Okay, listen. The real reason I came up here – and then I’11
get out of your way – is I’ve been thinking about what you said. About
let’s start having more fun with this show, you know? Let’s give it a
big kick in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>honcho #1</strong>: Well, we were thinking –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Let’s have a contest. Now this would mostly be
open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join
in.</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: What do we have to do?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: My lovely assistant, Shari. I’m glad you asked.
The contest is who can dig up – legally, of course – I’m not suggesting
that anyone break any laws – the most embarrassing and humiliating facts
about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting
System which owns Real TV.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But facts! They have to be verified. Anything
from their past, their present, business, personal – arrests, affairs …
And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material – I’11
give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. Hah?</p>
<p><strong>shari</strong>: So act now. Here’s Ed’s home phone
number.</p>
<p><strong>196 int. conference room</strong>: It’s packed with LAWYERS
and EXECS. Everyone is agitated, except Cynthia, who seems relaxed-Ed
and Shari are gone.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Legal?! How can this be legal? It’s
defamation! It’s slander! It’s…</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Not, technically. He is not showing a
reckless disregard for the truth.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: You’re fired!</p>
<p><strong>197 int. conference room - later</strong>: The Honchos are
watching Ed TV. They look STRAINED, ANXIOUS.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Uh-huh… uh-huh… Really?! She was how old?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: He pays a prostitute to do what to him? I don’t
even want that on my shoes.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Stop laughing or you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>scharlach</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia</strong>: I’ve got this great idea. We put together a
video. “The Network Executives Goofiest Moments.” And listen, i’ve
really loved working here.</p>
<p><strong>198 int. ed’s apartment - night</strong>: Ed is off the
phone,</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Okay. We have a winner. Now please don’t feel
badly if yours wasn’t selected. In our eyes, you’re all winners.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And each contestant gets one of these. An “I
tried to screw a network executive” tee-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go,
Andy.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Andy’s available for executions. And the winner
is …</p>
<p><strong>199 int. conference room</strong>: The Executives staring,
HORRIFIED.</p>
<p><strong>200 int. ed’s apartment</strong>: He takes out the card and
registers mock-surprise.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Hey, the winner is from right here in New York
city. Carl Bowers a former orderly at the Martin Center – a clinic that
specializes in, what they call, male enhancement procedures.</p>
<p><strong>201 int. conference room</strong>: Scharlach’s EYES WIDEN in
HORROR.</p>
