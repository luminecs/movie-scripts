<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You cannot pass!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder
of the Flame of Anor!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire
will not avail you, Flame of Ud�n!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Argh!</p>
<p><strong>boromir</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Fly, you fools!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Noooooooooooooooo!!!!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gaaandaaaaalf!!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is it, Mr. Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Nothing. Just a dream.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don�t
want to see any closer, and the one place we�re trying to get to. It�s
just where we can�t get. Let�s face it, Mr. Frodo, we�re lost. I don�t
think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He didn�t mean for a lot of things to happen,
Sam… but they did.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo? It�s the Ring, isn�t it?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It�s getting heavier.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What food have we got left?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, let me see. Oh yes, lovely � Lembas
bread. And look! More lembas bread.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t usually hold with foreign food, but
this Elvish stuff, it�s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it
Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Those rain clouds might.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This looks strangely familiar.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It�s because we�ve been here before! We�re
going in circles.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ah! What’s that ’orrid stink? I’ll warrant
there’s a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Yes. I can smell it. We�re not alone.</p>
<p>**[nighttime**: Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape appears on
top of the cliff. The creature Gollum has appeared and is making his way
down to the hobbits.]</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: The thieves! The thieves! The filthy little
thieves! Where is it? Where isss it? They stole it from us. My
preciousss. Curse them! We hates them! It�s ours, it is… and we wantssss
it!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: This is Sting. You�ve seen it before, haven�t
you… Gollum! Release him or I�ll cut your throat!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty
Elves twisted it. Take it off us!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Quiet you!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It�s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor�s going to
hear this racket! Let�s just tie him up and leave him.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: No! That would kill us! Kill us!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It�s no more than you deserve!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I
see him, I do pity him.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: There�s no promise you can make that I can
trust.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: We swears to serve the master of the
preciousss. We swears on… on the precious. Gollum. Gollum.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to
your word.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Yes… on the preciousss. On the
preciousss.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don�t believe you! Get down! I said,
down!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He�s trying to trick us! We let him go he�ll
throttle us in our sleep!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You know the way to Mordor?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You�ve been there before?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You will lead us to the Black Gate.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Merry. Merry!</p>
<p><strong>ugl�k</strong>: What is it? What do you smell?</p>
<p><strong>man-flesh uruk</strong>: Man-flesh.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Aragorn!</p>
<p><strong>ugl�k</strong>: They’ve picked up our trail! Let’s move!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Their pace has quickened. They must have
caught our scent. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Come on, Gimli!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Three days� and nights� pursuit. No food. No
rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Not idly do the leaves of L�rien fall.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: They may yet be alive.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Less than a day ahead of us. Come!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are
natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is
something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these
creatures, sets its will against us.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: The Uruks turn northeast. They�re taking
the hobbits to Isengard!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Saruman.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: The world is changing. Who now has the
strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand
against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two
towers?</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule
this Middle-earth.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: The old world will burn in the fires of
industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive
the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of
the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: The horsemen took your land. They drove
your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.</p>
<p><strong>dunland man</strong>: Murderers!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Take back the lands they stole from you!
Burn every village!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Argh!!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these
peasants stood against you. But no more.</p>
<p><strong>morwen</strong>: �othain! �othain! You take your sister.
You�ll go faster with just two.</p>
<p><strong>freda</strong>: Papa says �othain must not ride Garulf, he is
too big for him!</p>
<p><strong>morwen</strong>: Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and
raise the alarm. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>�othain</strong>: Yes, Ma!</p>
<p><strong>freda</strong>: I don�t wanna leave! I don’t wanna go,
Mama!</p>
<p><strong>morwen</strong>: Freda, I will find you there.</p>
<p><strong>morwen</strong>: Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>morwen</strong>: Go child!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Th�odred!</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Your son is badly wounded, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don�t defend
our country, Saruman will take it by force.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: That is a lie! Saruman the White has ever
been our friend and ally.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Gr�ma� Gr�ma� My son…? Gr�ma…?</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of
Saruman.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Why do you lay these troubles on an already
troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your
malcontent, your war-mongering.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: War-mongering?</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: How long is it since Saruman bought you? What
was the promised price, Gr�ma? When all the men are dead you will take
your share of the treasure?</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Too long have you watched my sister, too long
have you haunted her steps.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: You see much �omer, Son of �omund. Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of
death!</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Argh!!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Keep breathing! That�s the key! Breathe!
Ho!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: They�ve run as if the very whips of their
masters were behind them.</p>
<p><strong>mordor orc</strong>: We�re not going no further till we�ve
had a breather!</p>
<p><strong>ugl�k</strong>: Get a fire going!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Merry! Merry!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: I think… we might have made a mistake leaving
the Shire, Pippin.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What�s making that noise?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: It�s the trees.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Do you remember the Old Forest? On the
borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the
water that made the trees grow tall… and come alive.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Alive?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other.
Even move.</p>
<p><strong>ma�hur</strong>: I’m starving. We ain’t ‘ad nothin’ but
maggoty bread for three stinkin’ days!</p>
<p><strong>snaga</strong>: Yeah. Why can�t we have some meat? What about
them? They�re fresh.</p>
<p><strong>ugl�k</strong>: They are not for eating!</p>
<p><strong>grishn�kh</strong>: What about their legs? They don’t need
those. Ooh� They look tasty!</p>
<p><strong>ugl�k</strong>: Get back, scum!</p>
<p><strong>mordor orc</strong>: Carve them up!</p>
<p><strong>snaga</strong>: Just a mouth full.</p>
<p><strong>ugl�k</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ugl�k</strong>: Looks like meat�s back on the menu,
boys!!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Pippin, let�s go.</p>
<p><strong>grishn�kh</strong>: Go on, call for help. Squeal! No one�s
gonna save you now!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Pippin!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled
this night.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Riders of Rohan, what news from the
Mark?</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf
have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall
give you mine.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood
but a little higher from the ground.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: You would die before your stroke fell!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is
Gimli, son of Gl�in and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of
Rohan and of Th�oden, your king.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Th�oden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and
claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks
here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And
everywhere his spies slip past our nets.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We are not spies. We track a party of
Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They�ve taken two of our friends
captive.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them
during the night.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: But there were two hobbits. Did you see two
hobbits with them?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They would be small � only children to your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: We left none alive. We piled the carcasses
and burned them.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: I am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Hasufel! Arod! May these horses bear you to
better fortune than their former masters. Farewell.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Look for your friends. But do not trust to
hope, it has forsaken these lands. We ride north!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: It�s one of their wee belts.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Hiro �th� ab ’wanath…</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: AAARRGGHH!!!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: We failed them.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: A hobbit lay here, and the other. They
crawled.</p>
<p>**[aragorn starts to follow the tracks, with legolas and gimli behind
him. flashback**: Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away from the
battle.]</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Their hands were bound. Their bonds were
cut.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They ran over here. They were followed.</p>
<p>**[flashback**: Their hands freed, the hobbits run away from the
battle scene, dodging under a horse and trying to stay out of harms way.
As they flee, Grishn�kh grabs Pippin by his belt and clings on.]</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: The belt!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: The tracks lead away from the battle… into
Fangorn Forest.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Fangorn. What madness drove them in
there?</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Did we lose him? I think we lost him.</p>
<p><strong>grishn�kh</strong>: I�m gonna rip out your filthy little
innards! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Trees! Climb a tree!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Merry!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Hooooo…</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Argh!!</p>
<p><strong>grishn�kh</strong>: Let�s put a maggot-hole in your
belly.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Run, Merry!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Little Orcs! Bur�rum…</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: It�s talking, Merry. The tree is
talking!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Don�t talk to it, Merry. Don�t encourage
it.</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Treebeard, some call me.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: And whose side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Side? I am on nobody�s side because
nobody�s on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: We�re not Orcs. We�re Hobbits!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me! They come with fire, they come with
axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and
usurpers, curse them!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: No, you don�t understand. We�re Hobbits…
Halflings! Shirefolk!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Maybe you are and maybe you aren�t. The
White Wizard will know.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: The White Wizard?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Saruman.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: See, see, we have led you out! Hurry
hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Nice hobbit.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whoa, it�s a bog! He�s led us into a swamp!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will
take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: I found it, I did. The way through the
marshes. Orcs don’t use it. Orcs don’t know it. They go round for miles
and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick as shadows we must be.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There are dead things! Dead faces in the
water!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and
orcses. A great battle long ago. The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is
their name. This way. Don�t follow the lights.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the
dead ones and light little candles of their own.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gollum…</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Don�t follow the lights!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?</p>
<p>**[nightfall**: Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake. He is holding
the Ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it, mesmerized. Suddenly
he hears Gollum.]</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. our
preciousss…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Master should be resting. Master needs to
keep up his strength.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Mustn�t ask us. Not its business. Gollum,
Gollum</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Gandalf told me you were one of the River
Folk.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be
travellers far from home.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He said your life was a sad story.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: They do not see what lies ahead, when sun
has failed and moon is dead.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You were not so very different from a hobbit
once, were you… Sm�agol?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: That was your name once, wasn�t it? A long
time ago.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: My name… My name… S… S…Sm�agol�</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Argh!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Black Riders!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Hide! Hide!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Argh!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Argh!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: C�mon Frodo! C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Quick! They will see us! They will see
us!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I thought they were dead!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling
for it. They are calling for the preciousss.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo! It�s alright. I�m here.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very
close.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Ptui! Orc blood.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: These are strange tracks.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: The air is so close in here.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: This forest is old. Very old. Full of
memory… and anger.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: The trees are speaking to each other.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gimli!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Lower your axe.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Aragorn, nad n� ennas!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Man cenich?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: The White Wizard approaches.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Do not let him speak. He will put a spell
on us.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We must be quick.</p>
<p><strong>white wizard</strong>: You are tracking the footsteps of two
young hobbits.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>white wizard</strong>: They passed this way the day before
yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort
you?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Who are you? Show yourself!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It cannot be. You fell.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Through fire and water. From the lowest
dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Until at last, I threw down my enemy and
smote his ruin upon the mountainside.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Darkness took me. And I strayed out of
thought and time. Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a
life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me
again.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I’ve been sent back until my task is
done.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Gandalf? Yes… That’s what they used to call
me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Gandalf!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to
you now at the turn of the tide.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: One stage of your journey is over, another
begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all
speed.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes
are cheated by some spell.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Shadowfax. He’s the lord of all horses and
he’s been my friend through many dangers.</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: My home lies deep in the forest near the
roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is
where I�ll keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger
festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too
few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: The Black Gate of Mordor.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh save us. My ol’ Gaffer’d have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Master says to show him the way into Mordor,
so good Sm�agol does. Master says so.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That�s it then. We cannot get past that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look! The gate, it’s opening! I can see a way
down.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sam, no!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Argh!!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Master!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish
cloaks will hide us in there.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: No! No, no master! They catch you! They
catch you! Don�t take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always he�s
looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we
mustn�t let him have it.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: No! There�s another way. More secret. A dark
way.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why haven�t you spoken of this before?!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Because Master did not ask!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He�s up to something.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Are you saying there�s another way into
Mordor?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and
then� a tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He�s led us this far, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo, no.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: He�s been true to his word.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Lead the way, Sm�agol.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Good Sm�agol always helps.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Th�oden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Saruman�s
hold over King Th�oden is now very strong.</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?
Uncle?</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Will you not go to him? Will you do
nothing?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Be careful what you say. Do not look for
welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Oh, he� he must have died sometime in the
night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: I understand his passing is hard to accept,
especially now that your brother has deserted you.</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Leave me alone, snake!</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you
have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night, when all
your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you,
like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale
spring still clinging to winter’s chill.</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Your words are poison!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: You�ll find more cheer in a graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>h�ma</strong>: I cannot allow you before Th�oden-King so
armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Gr�ma Wormtongue.</p>
<p><strong>h�ma</strong>: Your staff.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Hmm? Oh. You would not part an old man from
his walking stick?</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He�s a
herald of woe.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late, Th�oden King.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: He�s not welcome.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Why should I� welcome you, Gandalf�
Stormcrow?</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: A just question, my liege. Late is the hour
in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind
you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked
words with a witless worm!</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: His staff! I told you to take the wizard�s
staff!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Th�oden, son of Thengel, too long have you
sat in the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: I would stay still, if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Hearken to me! I release you from the
spell.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Hahahhhahahahah! You have no power here,
Gandalf the Grey!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Argh!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is
drawn from a wound.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: If I go. . . Th�oden dies.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: You did not kill me, you will not kill
him!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Rohan is mine!</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Be gone!!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: I know your face. �owyn� �owyn.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Gandalf?</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Breathe the free air again, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Dark have been my dreams of late.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Your fingers would remember their old
strength better… if they grasped your sword.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Argh! I’ve only ever served you, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Your leechcraft would have had me crawling
on all fours like a beast!</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Send me not from your side.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his account.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Get out of my way!</p>
<p><strong>h�ma</strong>: Hail, Th�oden king!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Where is Th�odred? Where is my son?</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Simbelmyn�. Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that
these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Th�odred�s death was not of your
making.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: No parent should have to bury their
child.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: He was strong in life. His spirit will find
its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu h�l. Fer�u, Th�odred,
Fer�u.</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now
the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,
cot and tree.</p>
<p><strong>freda</strong>: Where�s mama?</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Shh…</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: This is but a taste of the terror that
Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear
of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women
and children. You must fight.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You have two thousand good men riding north
as we speak. �omer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for
their king.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: They will be three hundred leagues from
here by now. �omer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of
me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk
open war.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Open war is upon you. Whether you would
risk it or not.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: When last I looked, Th�oden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Then what is the king�s decision?</p>
<p><strong>h�ma</strong>: By order of the king, the city must empty. We
make for the refuge of Helm�s Deep. Do not burden yourselves with
treasures. Take only what provisions you need.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Helm�s Deep! They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: He�s only doing what he thinks is best for
his people. Helm�s Deep has saved them in the past.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: There is no way out of that ravine. Th�oden
is walking into a trap. He thinks he�s leading them to safety. What they
will get is a massacre. Th�oden has a strong will but I fear for him. I
fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end,
Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to
hold.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They will hold.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: The Grey Pilgrim… that�s what they used to
call me. Three hundred lives of men I�ve walked this earth and now I
have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my
coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You have some skill with a blade.</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Women of this country learned long ago: Those
without swords may still die upon them. I fear neither death nor
pain.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: What do you fear, my lady?</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old
age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or
desire.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden
of Rohan. I do not think that would be your fate.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Th�oden will not stay at Edoras. It�s
vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They
will flee to Helm�s Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous
road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have
women and children with them.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Send out your warg riders.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey Stinker! Don�t go getting too far
ahead!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Why do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Call him names; run him down all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Because� because that’s what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There’s naught left in ’im but lies and deceit. It’s the Ring he wants.
It’s all he cares about.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: You have no idea what it did to him. What
it�s still doing to him. I want to help him, Sam…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Because I have to believe he can come
back.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You can�t save him, Mr. Frodo.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What do you know about it? Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I’m sorry, Sam. I don’t know why I said
that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I do. It’s the Ring. You can’t take your eyes
off it. I’ve seen you. You’re not eating. You barely sleep. It’s taken a
hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was
entrusted to me! It’s my task! Mine! My own!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Can�t you hear yourself? Don�t you know who you
sound like?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: We wants it. We needs it. Must have the
precioussss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,
trickssssy, falssse!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: No! Not Master.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you,
hurt you, lie.</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Master�s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: You don�t have any friends. Nobody likes
YOU…</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Not listening. I�m not listening.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: You�re a liar and a thief.</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Mur�derer�!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Go away! HAHAHAHA!!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: I hate you. I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Where would you be without me? Gollum,
gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Master looks after us now. We don�t need
you.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Leave now and never come back.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Leave now and never come back!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Arrrgh!!!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: We… we told him to go away! And away he
goes, preciousss. Gone, gone, gone! Sm�agol is free!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Look! Look! See what Sm�agol finds! Hehehe!
Hahaha!</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: They are young. They are tender. They are
nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat them!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You�ll make him sick, you will, behaving like
that! There�s only one way to eat a brace of coneys.</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Argh!! What�s it doing! Stupid fat hobbit!
It ruins it!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What�s to ruin? There�s hardly any meat on
�em.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What we need is a few good taters.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: What�s taters, preciousss? What�s taters
uh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: PO-TAY-TOES! Boil �em. Mash �em. Stick �em in a
stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish….</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Pbbbttt!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Even you couldn�t say no to that.</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish… Give it
to usss rrraw… and wrrriggling! You keep nasty chips.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You�re hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They are
called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won�t
be long now. He will soon be ready.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ready to do what?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: To make his war. The last war that will
cover all the world in shadow.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We�ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr Frodo! Look! It�s an Oliphaunt!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No one at home will believe this…</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sm�agol?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We�ve lingered here too long. Come on,
Sam!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Bind their hands.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: It�s true you don�t see many Dwarf women. And
in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that they�re
often mistaken for Dwarf men.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It�s the beards….</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: And this, in turn, has given rise to the
belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground!</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Hahahaha!!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous�
Whoa!!</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Ooh!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: It�s alright, it�s alright. Nobody panic.
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: The light of the Evenstar does not wax and
wane� It is mine to give to whom I will… Like my heart� Go to sleep…</p>
<p>**[flashback**: Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell. He opens
his eyes and sees Arwen before him, smiling down at him.]</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I am asleep. This is a dream.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Then it is a good dream. Sleep�</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Min l� pennich nin i aur hen telitha.</p>

<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Arwen�</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Ae �-esteliach nad… estelio han. Estelio

<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Where is she? The woman who gave you that
jewel.</p>
<p>**[aragorn smiles and says nothing. flashback**: Elrond is speaking
to Aragorn in Rivendell, before he sets out with the Fellowship.]</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Our time here is ending. Arwen�s time is
ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear
away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be
evergreen.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: But never more than a memory.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: I will not leave my daughter here to
die.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: She stays because she still has hope.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: She stays for YOU! She belongs with her
people!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o auth a
n�r a naeth. for another life. Away from war… grief…</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Why are you saying this?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was a
dream, Arwen, nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: This belongs to you.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: It was a gift. Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: My lord?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with
all that is left of her kin.</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: What is it? H�ma?</p>
<p><strong>h�ma</strong>: I�m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Wargs!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Argh! A scout!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: What is it? What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Wargs! We are under attack!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Get them out of here!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: All riders to the head of the column!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Come on, get me up here, I�m a rider!
Argh!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: You must lead the people to Helm�s Deep.
And make haste!</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: I can fight!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: No! You must do this… for me.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Follow me! Yah!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Forward. I mean, charge forward! March
forward! That�s it! Go on!</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Make for the lower ground! Stick
together!</p>
<p><strong>warg-riders</strong>: Argh!!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Bring your pretty face to my axe!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Argh! That one counts as mine!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!</p>

<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Oooh!!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Aragorn!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Aragorn?</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Tell me what happened and I will ease your
passing.</p>
<p><strong>sharku</strong>: He�s Took a little tumble off the cliff.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: You lie!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of
Isengard will return. Leave the dead.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>refugees</strong>: Helm�s Deep! At last! There it is!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: We�re safe, my lady! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>freda</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>morwen</strong>: �othain! Freda!</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Make way for Th�oden!</p>
<p><strong>soldiers</strong>: Sire!</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Make way for the king!</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: So few. So few of you have returned.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Our people are safe. We have paid for it
with many lives.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: My lady…</p>
<p><strong>�owyn</strong>: Lord Aragorn, where is he?</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: He fell…</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar
the gate, and set a watch on the surround.</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Get them into the caves. Saruman’s arm
would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Helm�s Deep has one weakness. Its outer wall
is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more
than a drain.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of
device could bring down the wall?</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: If the wall is breached, Helm’s Deep will
fall.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: Even if it is breached, it would take a
number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: Tens of thousands.</p>
<p><strong>gr�ma</strong>: But, my lord, there is no such force.</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: A new power is rising. Its victory is at
hand!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: This night, the land will be stained with
the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: To war!!</p>
<p><strong>saruman</strong>: There will be no dawn for Men.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Look! There�s smoke to the south!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: There is always smoke rising from
Isengard these days.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Isengard?</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: There was a time when Saruman would walk
in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer
cares for growing things.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: It�s Saruman�s army! The war has started.</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: May the grace of the Valar protect you.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Brego�</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Arwen.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Tollen i l�. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si
bado, no c�rar. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: I have made my choice.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: He is not coming back. Why do you linger
here when there is no hope?</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: There is still hope.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: If Aragorn survives this war, you will still
be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you
hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of
mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will
die.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: And there will be no comfort for you. No
comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image
of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the
breaking of the world.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: But you, my daughter, you will linger on in
darkness and in doubt. As nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until
all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly
spent.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: Arwen… there is nothing for you here, only
death.</p>
<p><strong>elrond</strong>: A im, �-’erin veleth l�n?</p>
<p><strong>arwen</strong>: Gerich meleth n�n, ada.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: I amar prestar aen… han mathon ne nen,
han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith. I feel it in the water, I
feel it in The power of the enemy is growing. Sauron will use his puppet
Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. The
eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men. His war
on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The
strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to
understand. The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have
foreseen it. It is the risk we all took.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: In the gathering dark, the will of the
Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands
of men.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Men, who are so easily seduced by its
power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands, take the
Ring for his own and the world will fall. It is close now, so close to
achieving its goal.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: For Sauron will have dominion of all life
on this Earth, even unto the ending of the world. The time of the Elves
is over.</p>
<p><strong>galadriel</strong>: Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate? Do
we let them stand alone?</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: What news?</p>
<p><strong>madril</strong>: Our scouts report Saruman has attacked
Rohan. Th�oden�s people have fled to Helm�s Deep. But we must look to
our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an
army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>madril</strong>: Some thousands. More come every day.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Who�s covering the river to the north?</p>
<p><strong>madril</strong>: We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the
city is attacked, we won�t hold it.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from
Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do
not have the strength to repel him.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: My men tell me that you are Orc spies.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Spies?! Now wait just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Well if you�re not spies, then who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Speak.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is
my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Your bodyguard?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: His gardener.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: And where is your skulking friend? That
gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: There was no other.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: We set out from Rivendell with seven
companions. One we lost in M�ria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was
also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of
Gondor.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: You�re a friend of Boromir?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Yes… for my part.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: It will grieve you then to learn that he is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Dead? How? When?</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: As one of his companions, I�d hoped you
would tell me. He was my brother.</p>
<p><strong>gondorian ranger</strong>: Captain Faramir. We found the
third one.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: You must come with me. Now.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Down there.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: To enter the forbidden pool bears the
penalty of death. They wait for my command.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Shall I shoot?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy
sweet! I only wish to catch a fish , so juicy sweet!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Wait! This creature is bound to me. And I to
him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sm�agol. Master is here. Come, Sm�agol. Trust
master. Come!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: We must go now?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Sm�agol, you must trust master. Follow me,
come on. Come. Come, Sm�agol. Nice Sm�agol. That�s it. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Don�t hurt him! Sm�agol don�t struggle!
Sm�agol listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Master!!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Where are you leading them? Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Sm�a�gol… Why does it cry, Sm�agol?</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: Master is our friend… our friend.</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Master betrayed us.</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: No, not its business. Leave us alone!</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Filthy little hobbitses. They stole it from
us.</p>
<p><strong>sm�agol</strong>: No… No!</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: What did they steal?</p>
<p><strong>gollum</strong>: Myyy� PRECIOUSSS!! Aaaarrrggghhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now!
You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.
Disappear.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I can�t. You were right, Sam. You tried to
tell me, but� I�m sorry. The Ring�s taking me Sam. If I put it on, he�ll
find me. He�ll see.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr. Frodo…</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: So… this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of power within my grasp.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to
show his quality.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Stop it! Leave him alone! Don�t you understand?
He�s got to destroy it. That�s where we�re going. Into Mordor. To the
mountain of fire.</p>
<p><strong>damrod</strong>: Osgiliath is under attack. They call for
reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Please. It�s such a burden. Will you not help
him?</p>
<p><strong>damrod</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to
Gondor.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Mae carnen, Brego, mellon n�n.</p>
<p><strong>refugees</strong>: He�s alive!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way.
I�m gonna kill him! You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most
reckless man I ever knew! Bless you, laddie!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gimli, where is the king?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Le ab-dollen. You look terrible.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Hannon le.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: A great host, you say?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: All Isengard is emptied</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Ten thousand strong at least.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Ten thousand?!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It is an army bred for a single purpose: to
destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Let them come!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: I want every man and strong lad able to
bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: We will cover the causeway and the gate
from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot
inside the Hornburg.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are
Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I
know how to defend my own keep.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: They will break upon this fortress like
water on rock. Saruman�s hordes will pillage and burn, we�ve seen it
before. Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will
outlast them.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They do not come to destroy Rohan�s crops
or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last
child.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: What would you have me do? Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Send out riders, my lord. You must call for
aid.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are
not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gondor will answer.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold
fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was
Gon� � No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. Get the women and children
into the caves.</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: We need more time to lay provisions for a
siege, lord �</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: There is no time. War is upon us!</p>
<p><strong>rohan captain</strong>: Secure the gate!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: We Ents have not troubled about the wars
of men and wizards for a very long time. But now something is about to
happen that has not happened for an age… Ent Moot.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: What�s that?</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: ’Tis a gathering.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: A gathering of what?</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Beech, oak, chestnut, ash… Good, good,
good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: Move back! Move to the caves!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: Keep moving!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 3</strong>: Quickly now!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no
soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Most have seen too many winters.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Or too few. Look at them. They�re
frightened. I can see it in their eyes. Boe a h�n: neled herain dan caer
menig!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Si beriathar h�n. Amar n� ned Edoras.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Aragorn, men i ndagor. H�n �-… ortheri.
Natha daged aen! They cannot win this fight. They are</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Then I shall die as one them!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Let him go, lad. Let him be.</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Every villager able to wield a sword has
been sent to the armory. My lord?</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Who am I, Gamling?</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: You are our king, sire.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: And do you trust your king?</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Your men, my lord, will follow you to
whatever end.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: To whatever end� Where is the horse and the
rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on
the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the
west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Give me your sword. What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>haleth</strong>: Haleth, son of H�ma, my lord. The men are
saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is
hopeless..</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: This is a good sword, Haleth, son of
H�ma.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: There is always hope.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: We have trusted you this far. You have not
led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: �-moe edhored, Legolas.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: If we had more time I�d get this adjusted.
It�s a little tight across the chest.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: That is no Orc horn.</p>
<p><strong>bereg</strong>: Send for the king. Open the gate!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Open the gate!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: How is this possible?</p>
<p><strong>haldir</strong>: I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An
alliance once existed between Elves and men. Long ago we fought and died
together. We come to honor that allegiance.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Mae govannen, Haldir.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You are most welcome!</p>
<p><strong>haldir</strong>: We are proud to fight alongside men, once
more.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: You could have picked a better spot.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Well lad, whatever luck you live by, let�s
hope it lasts the night.</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Your friends are with you, Aragorn.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Let�s hope they last the night.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: A Eruch�n, �-dano i faelas a hyn an uben
tanatha le faelas!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: What�s happening out there?</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Shall I describe it to you? Or would you
like me to find you a box?</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Hehehehe!!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Dartho!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: So it begins.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Tangado halad!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Faeg i-varv d�n na lanc a nu ranc. armor is
weak at the neck and beneath</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Leithio i philinn!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Did they hit anything?</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Give them a volley.</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>man-with-missing-eye</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Send them to me! C�mon!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Pendraid!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Swords! Swords!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Legolas, two already!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: I�m on seventeen!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Argh! I�ll have no pointy-ear outscoring
me!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Nineteen!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Merry!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: We have just agreed.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: I have told your names to the Ent moot
and we have agreed � you are not Orcs.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Well, that�s good news.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: And what about Saruman? Have you come to a
decision about HIM?</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Now don�t be hasty, Master Meriadoc.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Hasty? Our friends are out there! They need
our help! They cannot fight this war on their own.</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: War, yes� It affects us all. But you must
understand, young hobbit. It takes a loong time to say anything in
ooold� Entish. And we never say anything� unless it is worth taking a
looong� time to say.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!
Twenty-one! Twenty-two!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Na fennas!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,
Saruman?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Togo hon dad, Legolas! Dago hon! Dago
hon!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Aragorn!! Argh!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gimli! Hado i philinn!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Herio!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We
must weather such things as we have always done.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: How can that be your decision?!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: This is not our war.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: But you’re part of this world! Aren�t you?!
You must help, please! You must do something!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Maybe Treebeard�s right. We don�t belong
here, Merry. It’s too big for us. What can we do in the end? We’ve got
the Shire. Maybe we should go home.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: The fires of Isengard will spread. And the
woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green
and good in this world will be gone. There won’t be a Shire, Pippin.</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your
men out of there!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: What are you doing? Argh! What are you
stopping for!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: HALDIR!!</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Brace the gate!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Hold them!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: To the gate! Draw your swords!</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Make way! We cannot hold much longer.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Hold them!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: How long do you need?</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Brace the gate!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: As long as you can give me!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gimli!</p>
<p><strong>theoden</strong>: Timbers! Brace the Gate!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Come on! We can take �em!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It�s a long way.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Toss me.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: I cannot jump the distance! You�ll have to
toss me!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Oh! Don�t tell the Elf.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Not a word.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Shore up the door!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: Make way!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: Follow me to the barricade.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 3</strong>: Watch our backs!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 4</strong>: Throw another one over here!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Higher!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Hold fast the gate!]</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>legolas</strong>: Aragorn!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Pull everybody back! Pull them back!</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Fall back! Fall back!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: They�ve broken through! The castle is
breached. Retreat!</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Fall back!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Retreat!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: Into the Keep!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from
there.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around.
Take us south!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: South? But that will lead you past
Isengard.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are
from harm. It�s the last thing he�ll expect.</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Mmmm. That doesn�t make sense to me. But
then, you are very small. Perhaps you�re right. South it is then. Hold
on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like
going down hill.</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Are you mad? We�ll be caught!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: No we won�t. Not this time.</p>
<p><strong>ranger 1</strong>: Look! Osgiliath burns!</p>
<p><strong>ranger 2</strong>: Mordor has come.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only
the power to destroy. Please, let me go.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Faramir, you must let me go!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: And a little family of field mice that
climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully. They�re always trying to
get somewhere where they � Oh!! Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: I�m sorry, Treebeard.</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: They had voices of their own. Saruman! A
wizard should know better!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or
the tongues of men for this treachery. My business is with Isengard
tonight. With rock and stone!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Hoorarooom… Come my friends. The Ents are
going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. Last march of the
Ents!</p>
<p><strong>madril</strong>: Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we�ll be overrun.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr Frodo!</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: It�s calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost
on me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hold on, Mr. Frodo� You’ll be alright…</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir
sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this
war.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from
Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The
Ring drove your brother mad!</p>
<p><strong>ranger</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr Frodo?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: They�re here. They�ve come.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: NAZG�L!! Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take
cover!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: The fortress is taken. It is over.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it! They still defend it! They have died defending
it!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They are breaking in!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Is there no other way for the women and
children to get out of the caves? Is there no other way?</p>
<p><strong>gamling</strong>: There is one passage. It leads into the
mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Send word for the women and children to
make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: So much death. What can men do against such
reckless hate?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Ride out with me. Ride out and meet
them.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: For death and glory.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: For Rohan. For your people.</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: The sun is rising.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Look to my coming at first light on the
fifth day. At dawn, look to the east.</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall
sound in the deep one last time!</p>
<p><strong>gimli</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Let this be the hour when we draw swords
together. Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath! Now for ruin! And a red
dawn!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Gandalf.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Th�oden king stands alone.</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: Not alone. Rohirrim!!</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: �omer!</p>
<p><strong>�omer</strong>: To the king!</p>
<p><strong>pippin</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: A hit. A fine hit!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Break the dam! Release the river!</p>
<p><strong>merry</strong>: Pippin, hold on!</p>
<p><strong>treebeard</strong>: Hold on, little hobbits!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you doing? Where are you going?!</p>
<p>**[slow motion**: Frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge.
A Nazg�l on a Fell beast emerges in front of him. Frodo stares at the
Nazg�l, fixated. Feeling the call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir
watches the unfolding tableau from below. As Frodo moves to put the Ring
on his finger and the Nazg�l flies closer and closer, Sam runs up and
knocks Frodo over. Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast.
Frodo and Sam roll down the stairs. As they come to a stop at the
bottom, Frodo holds Sam in a death grip, yells and points Sting at his
throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to
take the Ring away.]</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: Aaarrgghh!!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It�s me. It�s your Sam. Don�t you know your
Sam?</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: I can�t do this, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know. It�s all wrong. By rights we shouldn�t
even be here. But we are. It�s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The
ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And
sometimes you didn�t want to know the end. Because how could the end be
happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad
had happened?</p>
<p><strong>th�oden</strong>: Victory! We have victory!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But in the end, it�s only a passing thing, this
shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun
shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed
with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand
why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those
stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn�t. They kept
going because they were holding on to something.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What are we holding on to, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There�s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And
it�s worth fighting for.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.</p>
<p><strong>madril</strong>: You know the laws of our country, the laws
of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.</p>
<p><strong>faramir</strong>: Then it is forfeit. Release them.</p>
<p><strong>gandalf</strong>: Sauron�s wrath will be terrible, his
retribution swift. The battle for Helm�s Deep is over. The battle for
Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little
hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I wonder if we�ll ever be put into songs or
tales.</p>
<p><strong>frodo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I wonder if people will ever say, �let�s hear
about Frodo and the Ring.� And they�ll say �yes, that�s one of my
favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn�t he, dad.� �Yes, my
