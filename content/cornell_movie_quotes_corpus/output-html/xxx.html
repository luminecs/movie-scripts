<h1 id="xxx">xxx</h1>
<p><strong>sterling</strong>: I hate to drop in unexpectedly.</p>
<p><strong>sterling</strong>: Time for a slow boat to China.</p>
<p><strong>sterling</strong>: Oh bloody hell!</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Evening, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: What do you have?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Not a whole helluva lot. His final
transmission was mangled. About something or someone called “Ahab”.
Whatever it is, it cost him his life.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: He was the best there was. That makes
three agents lost.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: They’re ruthless and they have a lot of
firepower. It’s only a matter of time before they figure out how to
deploy Silent Night. Then we’re gonna have a catastrophe on our
hands.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of
impertinent cowboys</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: We’re gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA
boys couldn’t find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of
it.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: How will you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: I’ll go in with a team. But first I’m going
to need some intel. I’ll have to put someone inside, someone new,
someone they won’t see coming. One of their own.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: So you’ll dredge the bottom again.
You’ve done that before. The results were… uneven.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat.
I’ve had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your
desktop.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: The usual prospects. Convicts, contract
killers, murde…</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: The scum of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: But programmable. And expendable.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: I’ve seen enough. Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: They’re degenerates. There’s not a man
in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: That’s exactly why we need them.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: Get these “scum”, Mr. Gibbons, bring
them in. Test them. Train them. Find your man.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Crump… I’m sorry, no one by that
name.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Hey! You can’t go up there!</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: We’ve got an intruder in the express
elevator!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Sky, you there? Start packin’ cause we are
out of here!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Did I promise you a fat vacation or what?
Get ready to get down in paradise.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hey, you don’t need all this just to go on
vacation. Unless this ain’t for going on vacation…</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: I’m through, Xander.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I can see that. Why?</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles
in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding
off cliffs, all with no health insurance… It’s insane, I can’t take it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m having fun, what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: You have all this talent, and you waste it. You
won’t take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have
their own video games! But no, you’ve got too much “integrity” for
that.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I don’t wanna go mersh, you know that. But
hey, if this is about money…</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I got an advance on the next bootleg. Let’s
get out of here, just you and me. We’ll chill out in Bora Bora for a
couple months.</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: French Polynesia? This wouldn’t last us a week
in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Alright, so I’ll get more.</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: It’s not about the money, X! You never plan for
anything. I can’t live like that anymore, I need some stability.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Well if you’re bailing, I guess I’d better
give you your surprise now.</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I was gonna wait till the islands, but…</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: You’re serious?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Of course I’m serious. I bought it, didn’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: This is so typical. I can’t believe you. I’ve
barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of
your mind?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I don’t know. I thought this is what you
wanted. You want stability, here it is.</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: You can’t just propose to me out of nowhere.
You think that’s going to solve our problems? I’m sorry, X. It was a
kick for a while, but it’s over. You’re just not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re not exactly “going anywhere”
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: You’re wrong about that. I’m heading out that
door right now.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: She had nothing to do with the tower jump.
She’s nobody. I just met her last night. Tell them. I hardly know
you.</p>
<p><strong>sky</strong>: Keep the ring. It looks better on you
anyways.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: God, I hate cops. What’s the charges this
time?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You… pussies…</p>
<p><strong>a sideways image</strong>: an out of focus COFFEE
CREAMER.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hey. Where am I? How did I get here?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I don’t know, you wandered in ten minutes
ago and put your head down. I told you we were closing.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Want some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Fine, just fine. Come on and sit. I’ll get
you something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: I said, you got a problem, boy?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Problem? No, no problem. You go right
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: With what? I said, go right on ahead with
what?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Whatever, dude.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Alright, nobody make a move! Shoulda walked
away when you had the chance, dumb shit.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Forget him, Buck, let’s just do it.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Shut up! You keep still or I’m gonna make
damn sure you stop breathing today. Got that?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Alright, “Buck”, whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that
register! Couldn’t just let him leave, could ya! You know what I’m gonna
do to ya for that? Huh? Do ya?!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Better shoot me quick.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Too late!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Alright, bitch, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Talk! What’s the game? Who are you
people?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: The name’s Gibbons. You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Looks like a diner.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem
is. I wake up drugged to find what? You’ve got a “salesman” over here
reading a three week old newspaper. He’s pulling a 211 with a “trucker”,
who happens to be packing a cop issue H&amp;K 9mm. I get tipped that
something is going down when she passes me a note. How’s that for
twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the
guns before I “walked” in? And if that’s true, why’d they stop and wait
until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both
are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they
went through the same training program. Ergo they ain’t strangers and
this isn’t what it seems. That’s how I knew yo-yo wouldn’t get a round
off even if I gave him all day. Why?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Cuz there’s nothing but blanks in these
guns. And no offense, but their performances were terrible.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Most guys we ran through this either took
off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That shows me already that you don’t have a
clue. What’s it to you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Whether you thought this was for real or
not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me
something about your character.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Good for you. Now why don’t you stop wasting
my time and tell me what you want. You didn’t go through all this for my
benefit.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: It’s your lucky day. You just might get the
chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you
enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have
this kind of budget? Now you’re gonna hit me with the sales pitch.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Alright, Cage, you’ve got me. This is one
of those moments. “Many are called, few are chosen”, that kind of thing.
Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: ..If you’re trolling around for narcs, man,
have you got the wrong guy.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of
law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda
saved you a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Oh I don’t know, I think the tests work
pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn’t admit to in a
million years.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Are we done now? You’ve got nothing on me.
So if you ain’t booking me, I’m walking.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You’ve got this wrong. You’re not under
arrest, you’ve been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to
me.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Sure as gravity. I’ve had a feeling about
you from the start, Cage. It’s nausea.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a
clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and
suddenly they think they’re God.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You know what I hate? It’s always the
assholes that pass the tests.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You bastards love to see me sleep.</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: What’s so damn funny?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Been to any good diners lately?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We must be the final “candidates”.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Nobody told me this was a costume party.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I’ve worked with guys like this before. Black
Ops. Serious government spooks.</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: Heads up, man. What’s this thing on my
back?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: A parachute. This does not argue well.</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: This is bullshit! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I get the picture.</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: Jee-zus, man! What the hell now? Another damn
test?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We should head for those trees.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Don’t look at me, brother. It’s every man
for himself.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You boys are too good for me. Guess I failed
this one, huh?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: So much for “every man for himself”. Nice to
see you again, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: They really went all out on this one. This is
a pretty gnarly setup.</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: Check the table in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: This oughta be good.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: This must be el jefe. How’s it goin’ jefe?
Some weather we’re havin’.</p>
<p><strong>hideous, blood encrusted torture devices</strong>: a HACK
SAW, a BOLT CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s on the menu tonight? The old
blowtorch-to-the-family jewels routine, I’ll bet. Hey, you want roasted
nuts, let’s break out the Planters.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: Do you know what we do with people come round
here? You know what we do with people come in our business?</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: We cut the Achilles tendon. Your feet flop
around like a marionette. You ain’t walkin’ nowhere no more. Sound good,
tough guy? Or maybe instead you wanna tell me something.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: Whatchu doing here?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: That’s some accident, hombre. You accidentally
fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back
yard.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: We seen this kind of parachutes before, you
know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We’re anti-social. We don’t have any
friends.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: No friends, huh? That’s funny, I don’t know no
U.S. Army that comes without no friends. That’s cuz U.S. Army is
pussies. They always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters
and the see-in-the-dark glasses. So don’t you tell me you all alone out
here, my friend. You bullshitting the wrong guy.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Who’s writing this dude’s dialogue?</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: He’s a pretty good actor, though.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Makes the diner look like a sixth grade play.
He’s even got them crazy eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: You ain’t begun to see crazy yet, amigo.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We’re on to the game, ese. You got the fake
blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools… It’s
all very cute. But come on, let’s quit while you’re ahead. I’m only
trying to save you a beatin’.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a
guy got himself chained to the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my
guest.</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: Now you’re gonna make me enjoy this, funny
guy. Now I’m gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?</p>
<p><strong>jefe</strong>: What’s that, eh? I thought you didn’t have no
friends!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Keys. You got ’em?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hand ’em to me.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I hope you’re getting paid extra for
this.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I’m hit! I’m hit!</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: They’re shooting for real! This is all
real.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Aw shit.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Help me with this guy.</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: It’s like you said, every man for himself.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That only works if you’re a man!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I used to be a SEAL, it’s not the first time
I’ve been shot. Thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Keep your head down, I’ll be right back. I’m
gonna steal us some wheels.</p>
<p><strong>virg</strong>: They’re all over the place! What the hell’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Looks like we’re in the middle of the drug
war.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go that way,
I’m gonna go this way. They can’t follow us both.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m gonna need to hit the trees after a
night like this.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it
Saturday already?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Congratulations, you’ve just graduated at
the head of your class.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re a cold piece of work. You almost got
three people killed out there.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Good thing you were there to save the day.
Come walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You’ve really got me confused, Cage. On the
one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to
protect men you hardly knew… and on the other you have an arrest record
that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I’m not following
your evolution.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You want the cheap backstory? The runaway
mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You’re not
interested in my past, you’re interested in my future as some kind of
spy.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You’re perceptive too. I forgot to add that
to the list of surprises. I’m with the National Security Agency. And
unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m not interested. I’ve already got a
job.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You’re an adrenaline junkie with one foot
in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that
means nothing and you’re not getting any younger.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I plan on getting a lot older. And playing
spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: That’s too bad. I thought a guy like you
would appreciate the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s this? You’re gonna try to scare me
now?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Do you know the reason why I try to recruit
guys like you? There’s no risk.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: There’s nobody back home who’s gonna ask
questions if you just… disappear for a while.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Now I’m the one who’s nauseous. So what’s
the deal? What do you need me for?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: There’s some folks I want to keep tabs on.
Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What do I get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: If you find out what I want to know, and if
I’m able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to
your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re one sick bastard. A sadist with a
badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter
which way I go I’m likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So
here’s my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Not bad for a gimp.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: What’s with that “X” on the back of your
head? Does that mean you’re “extreme”? I’ve got some news for you,
Mr. X, you’re a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another
couple of X’s on your head.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’ll take that under advisement. Maybe I can
be like you and lose a leg for the old Stars and Bars. I bet the flag’s
a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: One twitch and my finger and thumb will
meet inside your esophagus. Believe me, Mr. X, I’ve put foot to ass for
my country on many occasions and I don’t feel the urge to stop just yet.
So think carefully before you tell me: Is “kiss my ass, Hop- along” your
final answer?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: I thought you might see it my way.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Where you going, X? I said where you
going?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: There better be a movie on this Goddam
flight.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: How about a pedicure as long as you’re down
there. What’s this? Lo-Jack?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Wherever you go on the planet, I’ll find
you. There’s no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles
will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you
hit the ground. Is all that clear?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Yeah, I spy or I die.</p>
<p><strong>nerdy agent</strong>: This is your communicator. You’ll
identify yourself by a call sign. From here on out you’re Bulldog Omega
5.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You must stay up late to come up with shit
like that.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: I expect you to call in regularly with
progress reports.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Fine, but I’m not gonna be no Bulldog Omega
5.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Uh… Call signs derive from the parameters of
the mission.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: If he doesn’t like it, we can make an
exception just this once. We’ll call him “Triple X”.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Up yours.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It
fits so well because you’re obscene.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Just remember, I’ll be watching.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’ve got something for you to chew on. Next
time you send someone to save the world, make sure they like the planet
the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What game is that?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes?
They’re called “Anarchy 99”, they’re the bad guy bosses.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Do they have any special powers? The bosses
always have special powers.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You wanna check it out? Come here.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: First we’ve got Anders, the psycho looking
biker. In charge of transportation and smuggling. Controls every
trucking union in Eastern Europe. Don’t look too clean, either.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into
snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and
the drug trade.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: This guy’s kinda dorky lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm,
but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the “Finger
of God”. Assassination and weapons.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Who’s the hottie?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You like her, huh? Petra. She runs their
finances, money laundering, computers. Joined the gang after spending
some time as the girlfriend of this dude, Yorgi Azar Zimin. Capo of
Anarchy 99.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three
Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it “blood week”. He combined all of their
global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: “Anarchy” 99”?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What are you gonna do? They’re Euro-
trash.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What weapons do you have?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Just about anything I want, it looks like.
This is gonna be tough, though. There’s no way to save this game. I
gotta get it right the first time through.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What do you get if you finish?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to
stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: He gets to be the hero.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: This is bullshit, man, I wanna see some
ID.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re both named Ivan? That’s gotta be
confusing on Valentine’s Day. So where we headed? Fellas, I said where
we headed? Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: James Bond never had to put up with this
shit.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’ve been on a plane for twelve hours, I
think I’ll stand.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When
you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do
what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I’ll shoot
you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: You’re here because your government is
putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech
affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don’t shit
in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get
our.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: First of all, you should kill whoever sold
you that suit. Two, I don’t wanna be here either, so just step off.
Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would’ve done it by now,
so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we’ve got that sorted
out, I’m gonna get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Be ready in three hours.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Nice hops.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: The corner. Anarchy 99.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: See the one with the funny colored hair?
Crazy bitch stabbed one of my men in the knee-cap. There they are,
American. The low-rent millionaire criminals. And you thought only your
country had white trash. American?</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That’s the guy.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: This pizda? Never seen him before.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Who you workin’ for? What do you do for a
living, dickhead?</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Uh… I am… I work in insurance.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Look what we have here. Czech 5-0 on the
mack.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you
pay there’s always another with his hand out. How did you pick him
out?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: He flashed his badge to half the bar when he
bought his drink.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I appreciate you bringing this to our
attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the
house.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Thanks, but I’m here on business. I heard
you’re the G around here. I’m looking for some cars, expensive ones. A
lot of them.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Sorry, man, don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m talking about the sports cars that
disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don’t know
about ’em, who does?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I guess I heard wrong.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Xander Cage!</p>
<p><strong>anders</strong>: The X man! We seen your bootleg videos!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You sick! You sick crazy on a board, on a
bike! Everything!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: This is insane, man. Xander Cage in Prague.
Come on, sit. Sit with us.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I remember that one where you jump the
motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: When else are you gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You almost died on that one.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Cops arrested me while I was still in
surgery. Did two months.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We
get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Ferrari’s, Lamborghini’s… high end pasta
rockets. Ten to start.</p>
<p><strong>anders</strong>: Ten! No problem! We do that no problem!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Ten is hardly worth the effort. We’re talking
a lousy million five U.S.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I have Japanese buyers who are looking to
move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they’re after. And
it’s a mil two, max.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Do you know what a wire transfer is?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should
quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: My goodness, a word with four syllables. I
should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits
with a mental butter knife.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Don’t look at me, X, she handles all the
details.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: It’ll work faster if I have an account
number.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: You’ll have forty-eight hours to complete the
transfer. Don’t waste our time.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Wouldn’t dream of it. I’m even gonna throw
in a few extra bucks to send you to charm school.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Alright, now that business is finished, we
party! Bitches, come! We have a drink and toast the deal!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I believe I can hang with you fellas for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a
purchase. Ten cars.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: If you’re trying to push my buttons, you’re
on the right track. Don’t make me question my own judgment, X.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Buddy, you sent me here to get close to
their organization, that costs money.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: One point two million dollars? I did not
authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m already on a first name basis with these
dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: We’re not after car thieves here.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What the hell am I after? You’re telling me
dick.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: That information is classified. You’re
there to gather information on their operations, period.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a
million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What
else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: My friend, if you’re planning on crossing
me…</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I know, poison needles in my shins. You’ve
got 36 hours. Peace, out.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: Ridiculous. Cut him off. I’m sorry
Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: I think we should send him whatever he
wants.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: You what? A wire transfer of this
size?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: If it means getting Silent Night back,
absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: You’re talking about a very expensive
risk here.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: He’s gotten closer in 24 hours than all of
the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now
even if he’s just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play. I put him out
there, Sam. If he doesn’t come up with the money, they’ll kill him. I
can’t let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: Why not? You were going to throw him in
a tub full of acid, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sam tannick</strong>: Alright, do what you want. But keep the
screws on him. He’s a wild card. That could be either good or bad.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can
deal with that.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Your government must know something we
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap
pieces of garbage. I’m agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I’m looking for
what’s his name. Three X’ s.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That’s would be me.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Figures. You got someplace we can spread
out my gear or what? I mean today.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: I’ll leave you two alone to talk.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Yeah, thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright,
here’s the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed
them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until
you showed up.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to
brown-nose the right people.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Is that supposed to be funny? I’m not
laughing. I’ve worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field
agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some
reject from the Ozzfest.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Why don’t you show me some gear before you
get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything
you say, sir.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What is all this? I didn’t even order some
of this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: You’re gonna need it, rookie, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: An all-terrain mobile video monitoring
system for surveillance. I call it the “Roach Cam”. See the little
camera it’s got for a head?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Kinda looks like you.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: “Terminator” climbing claws.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Miniature power cams set in on contact,
giving you a sure grip on any surface.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: They come in any other styles or colors?</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: This is your standard dart gun.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That one I’m real familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: You’ve got your chromium knock-out dart,
microphone listening dart, explosive dart, even one with a splatter
blood packet, whatever you need. They also come in a special 9mm casing
for use with your service pistol.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Multi-view binoculars. Nine different
enhanced vision modes, plus a digital camera.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Infrared, starlight… Even a special
“penetrator” mode to see through walls, curtains, almost anything…</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I think I’ll hang on to these.</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Think again, that’s government property.
You have to sign for everything. I’ve got one more that wasn’t on your
list.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: From the Beastie Boys collection?</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: It’s a stakeout suit. It’s got food, water,
recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It’s all- weather,
fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole
outfit deploys into a parachute.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re joking, right?</p>
<p><strong>shavers</strong>: Now that I’ve given you the overview, we’re
going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational
detail.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I thought that was in detail.</p>
<p><strong>anders</strong>: So what you think? Beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Has it arrived yet?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Nothing. He had two days.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Perhaps he is not all he says he is.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Very nice. I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I’m somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit
of a problem…</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I had to inspect the merchandise first.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: This is a gift. From me to you.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: It’s a little nothing, you take it.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Come on, get in.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re alright, Yorgi.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Smile, bychara.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Yorgi!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: What in the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: What’s going on, my friend?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You tell me! You got a sniper up there or
what?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: He’s not with us, Xander. He must be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or
I swear to God I’m gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Get him! Find out who he is!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’ve got him. Buckle up.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: That’s the cop from the club!</p>
<p><strong>in slo-mo</strong>: a spray of BLOOD erupts from his chest
and Slovo falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and
betrayal.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: What are you doing? Get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I don’t believe it! You can’t shoot a cop in
the middle of the street!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Had to do what I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You say you get a million, you get the
million. Some cop gives us shit, he’s dead. Jesus Christ, man, you’re
hard-core!</p>
<p><strong>ivan 1</strong>: It’s sweet.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s “Anarchy 99”?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: It’s all this craziness! It’s what we’ve been
living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in
Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what?
Politics? Who’s politics? Not ours.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You wanna see my politics?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Screw the world. If I’m gonna die for
something, it better be bitches and money.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: That’s what I’m talking about, man! That’s
why Anarchy 99 was born.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no
jails. It’s everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is
freedom but they don’t have a clue. There’s an old punk song. It says:
“America stands for freedom, but if you think you’re free…”</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: “…try walking into a deli and urinating on
the cheese”. ‘Anarchy Burger’ by the Vandals.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You got it, man. It’s stupid but it’s true.
True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That’s
when you know you’re living, man.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: How you gonna do that with government and
rules everywhere?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Easy. You get enough money that you grow an
ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You hang with us, buddy, taste some freedom!
Petra! Dance with this guy!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: This is great, dancing with the back of your
head.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: If you got a problem with me, why are we
dancing?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Yorgi asked me to.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You do everything Yorgi says?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: It’s gonna be like that, huh? You got all
bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Mind your business.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Did you guys used to date? That’s it, right?
He broke your heart and you’re still soft on him. That’s funny, it don’t
seem to fit with a tough broad like you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Why are you still hanging around? Your
business is finished, you should go home.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I was invited. What’s your story?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I don’t know who you are or where you come
from, but I don’t like you. You ask too many questions.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Come on, don’t front like that. You’ll put a
guy right off you.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Don’t even bother, X man, I’m not your
type.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That right? Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: My chest is too small and my brain is too
big.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Xander, check it out! The revolution
begins!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Let’s get some air, man.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You
really know how to live.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: It’s a beautiful town, Prague. It’s been good
to me.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’ve been here before, when I was a kid. My
old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in
Hamburg.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You, an Army brat? I don’t see that one at
all. Did you join the service as well?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin
soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably
discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total
bullshit, so he was sure he’d get his name cleared, but it didn’t
happen.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Connections and politics, it’s the same
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: My old man, he bought into the system, and
it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don’t believe in nothing
I can’t see and touch.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Next week these idiots are having a peace
conference here. What the hell are they going to talk about? It’s the
system itself that causes all the world’s problems. You’re okay, buddy.
Come on, it’s getting early.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: This way, girls, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Diversified global operations. The sun never
sets on our empire.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Not bad, yes? The original owners, they just
one day decide to move out.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Yeb vas, z’opa. Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I’ve got meetings this afternoon, I’ve got to
get some sleep. Just pick a girl.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That’s alright, I’m kinda tired.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You want to insult me? This is my
hospitality. Pick one.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Good, now find a room to crash in.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You gonna tuck us in?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Listen, no offense, but I’m not in the
market right now, okay? You can stay here, but let’s not –</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You don’t understand a word I’m saying, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Stupid, right? That’s what I was trying to
tell you. I just got out of this heavy thing…</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: The things I have to do for my country.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Looking for a phone book. I want to call a
cab. Unless you wanna give me a ride?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We hung out last night, remember?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I also remember you drove your car here. Who
are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about
it. Who are you working for?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hey, take it easy. I’m just a dude trying to
make a buck.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study
everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you’re doing. Empty your
pockets.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’ve got to relax, baby, you’re
paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hey, you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so
little about you, except that you’re not what you say you are.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That makes two of us then, sweetheart,
because I ain’t buying your bullshit either. You’re not like them, I can
see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who’s bullshitting who?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Something bothers me about you, Mr. Xander
Cage…</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Get Kirill. Now!</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I’m inside the police mainframe. Do you see
anything?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I’ve searched their E-mail. No funeral
announcement, no obituary, no call- to-arms. Nothing on the news, even.
I swear I saw a cop get shot yesterday. How come no one is talking about
it?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I also check the wire transfer. I follow the
money back to it’s source, but there is no source. It comes from
nowhere. First they bring CIA, then British SAS, now maybe they plumb
the lower depths. Maybe now they send someone who looks like us. Maybe
someone like our houseguest Mr. X.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: The eyes don’t lie. All this has gotten to
you, hasn’t it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi’s girlfriend and you stayed
because it was fun. Now you don’t like it so much, but you’re in so deep
you can’t get out anymore. Tell me if I’m wrong, Petra.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Look at you. You’re helping run things now.
You’re a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and
you were a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: It’s cool, I feel you. I might even be able
to help. Here, let me show you something. You wanna see what’s in my
pocket, I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: What are you?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m an information gatherer. You wanna go
somewhere and talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: They went to breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Perogies, potato pancakes, fried goose
livers, the sausage plate and a pot of Turkish coffee.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m just gonna have a garden salad. Oil and
balsamic vinegar on the side.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: That’s how you eat? It’s like a gerbil.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m from L.A.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: So why don’t you tell me something about who
you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are
you from a rival clan?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Let’s just say I’m freelancing and leave it
at that.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Whoever sent you knew what they were doing.
You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who
make a lot of noise but don’t say much.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Don’t judge a comic book by it’s cover.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: You agree with a lot of what he says, don’t
you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I know where he’s coming from. The only
thing I really don’t get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that
out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Don’t even start. I’ll be honest, I don’t
trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that
I want to leave. What can you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: The people I know want facts, the kinds of
things an insider would know. They’re interested in putting Anarchy 99
out of business.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: All I have to do is risk my life providing
you with these facts.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We could work together. Then maybe we could
both get the hell out of here. There’s a beach in Bora Bora with my name
on it.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: A beach named X? That I’d like to see.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: So there you have it. I guess you just have
to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Da!</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Listen very carefully, Petra. We think Cage
may be an American agent, do you understand what I’m telling you?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ve got your back. I’m right
across the street, above the bakery. Just bring him outside and let me
do the rest.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s up? Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: They tell me you’re an American agent.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: There’s no more time for games. They made
you. There’s a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye.
Tell me if it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: It’s a long story, but yeah, more or
less.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Jesus Christ. You’re going to have to go out
the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six
o’clock. Look it up. We’re taking a trip. Be there at six and you’ll
have plenty to tell your people.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: If I go out the back, he’ll know you’ve
warned me.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: That’s alright, I’ll figure something
out.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Not an option. Just get up slowly like
everything’s cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry
for me, I’m not gonna let you down.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Nice and easy, Petra…</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I can’t let this happen. I want you to go out
the back. I’ll make up some excuse.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: They’ll kill you, you know they will.
Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Let’s see what’s going on inside…</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Ready the boat.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What the hell are you guys stealing?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate
accident.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: No way, man, no way. I’m just supposed to be
an observer. Aw shit. This job sucks.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don’t work,
your ass is kicked.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: What was that for?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I’d forgotten how exciting it is working
together.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You’ve been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought
you no longer cared.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Why don’t we go below decks and work off some
of this adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Viktor! Stay the course.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Is the boy alright?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yes. I will cut the others loose, you must
run the bilge pumps!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Captain, huh? You get a lot of broads with
that uniform?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: They call it “Ahab”, it’s a solar powered
submersible. It can circumnavigate the globe on it’s own. They use it to
track and study the migration patterns of whales.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You did say “Ahab”? You’re sure about
that?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here’s what I’m
thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably
put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and
three weeks later it’s swimming up the Potomac.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: This is good work, X, damn fine work. You
need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this
“Ahab”.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hey, one miracle at a time. They’re on to me
now, remember?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: I’m gonna be en route with a team shortly
to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And
X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You’re a grungy little phoenix, you know
that? Keep up the good work.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Get in. We’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I want all that… In there.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: So what’s the plan with this Ahab? Are they
selling it or what?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: No, something worse. He says it’s a surprise,
but I know him. This is his masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We’ve got to find out what it is. Can you
handle that?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: There’s something I didn’t have time to tell
you before.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I’m a agent as well. KGB. I’ve been
undercover for over a year.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re what? What the hell have you been
doing?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I don’t know. Eight months ago I stop hearing
from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like
I was told. Soon I’m in so far, they’d kill me if I left. Now every day
I get farther and farther away from what I was. I’m like you said, a
criminal.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m busted up for you, but Jesus, what the
hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you
didn’t lift a finger.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: No, I guess I’ve been no help at all to
you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Get your head back in the game. There are
lives at stake here.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Of course. I’ll do what I can. I have to go,
before they notice.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: When can I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: You can’t, it’s too risky. I’m not much help
anyway, remember?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Okay, fire one.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Great piece of hardware.</p>
<p><strong>anders</strong>: “Silent Night… Holy Night”</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: There’s some bullshit going on!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Xander, my friend, that can only be you. Why
don’t we put our weapons down for a few minutes and discuss this like
friends. How would you like to come to work for us instead? We could
Rage Against the Machine together.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Speaking of people that are full of shit,
funny you should mention those guys!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: They put their records out through Sony, one
of the biggest corporate machines on the planet. Some revolutionaries,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Come on, you’re the one who’s fooling
yourself. Why risk your life for your government when we can offer you a
future that is truly free?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: He blew the gate control. Anders! Get the
bastard!</p>
<p>****: action will be re-choreographed based on actual locations. Any
freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated</p>
<p><strong>in slow motion</strong>: The bike leaves the ramp and soars
up over the fence.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Slovo?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Dude, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide
out here with you. Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I found something big enough for us to take
these guys down with. They’ve got a of nerve agent they’re gonna
unleash.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Is this what you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Yeah, give it here.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Sorry, “dude”.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s the deal?</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Oh come on, don’t feel bad. You got played,
so what? You’re new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into
this business one day and have all the angles figured out?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Why you dogging me up?</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: They came and found me. They said they’d kill
me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal.
These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>slovo</strong>: Where do you want it? The head to be quick?
Or the chest for an open casket?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What the hell are you doing? You could’ve
killed me!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I heard you talking. I could tell where you
were in the room.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on anymore. I
thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody’s switching sides
like it’s the WWF.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What are you doing with the Ivans?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I know which cops are good and which are bad.
Come with me. Come on, right now.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: We’re getting out of this place. We’ve done
enough.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Wait a minute, whoa. We can’t go now. What’s
Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: It doesn’t matter anymore, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: What do we owe our governments? Yours
kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Petra, this ain’t about the people that sent
us here, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: No, now it’s about us. Let’s do something for
us before we both get killed. Don’t you want to get to Bora Bora,
Xander?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We can’t leave now. We have to do
something.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Why? You’re the one who believes in nothing.
Screw the world, or whatever you said.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Alright, so I was full of shit. I thought
believing in things was wrong. Turns out believing in nothing is worse.
You might as well be dead. I’m not thrilled with the world, but I’m not
gonna let those idiots start killing people. Come on, you’re a cop,
we’ve got to get these guys.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: They left. To a fortress in the
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We’ll have to go after them.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Aren’t you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: A long time ago I learned how to put fear
away in a little place in my head. Maybe that’s my problem. If you don’t
feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your
life up in ways you can’t imagine.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I must be healthy, then, because I’m scared
to death. I guess I’d better get back to Yorgi.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You don’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Yes, I do. You’re right. I can’t just let him
go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Aren’t they gonna wonder were you’ve
been?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill
you and then kill the cop. They’ll believe me. I’ve been lying for so
long, one more time won’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: When this is over, we’re just gonna take
off, the two of us. Take a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: What the hell are we doing? We’re doing all
this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven’t even
slept together yet.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: That gives us something to live for.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hold positions!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Nothing like fresh powder.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Gibbons, long time no talk. You wouldn’t
believe my day.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: What the hell has been going on, Triple X?
How about a status report?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The
usual.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: I’m on the way with a team to relieve you.
What’s the latest?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of
rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light
colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells
me this it that “classified” stuff you didn’t want me to know about.
Does the song “Silent Night” mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Yes it does.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then
that.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Silent Night is the name of a top secret
binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and
detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud.
When it settles down to Earth, it’ll kill everything in the
vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we
came up with?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. So now that you know,
you understand why it’s important that we get it back.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Kinda funny, though, isn’t it? We’re not
supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played
by the rules.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Somebody else makes those decisions, not
guys like you and me. You’ve done your job, X, head back to Prague. I’ll
be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: We don’t have that kinda time, boss, I don’t
think Prague’s gonna be around much longer. I’ve gotta go now. I’ve got
a lot of bad guys to kill.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: That was for Anders.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Don’t forget goatee boy. I greased him up on
the diamond run.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Look who we found playing outside.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice anything
strange about X? He looks slightly less than dead.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Yorgi, I thought he was –</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Do you think I didn’t know about you all
along? My contacts in the KGB told me you were coming. You show up
undercover and, I must admit, you play your part to the hilt. When it’s
time to be cruel, you are cruel. When it’s time to be passionate, you
are very very passionate indeed.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I could have killed you, but I thought this
would be so much more fun. To twist you and use you how I see fit. And
to be honest, you went much farther than I ever expected you would for
your country.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: And you. Why do you have such a problem
staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I wanted to get the hell out of Prague
before Silent Night falls.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Not bad, man, not bad. You put things
together quick. Prague it is.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: The Peace conference…</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Nice place to start, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: What’s the gimmick, Yorgi? That’s the part I
don’t get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I
didn’t think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You think I’m after money? I told you, my
friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom
you have to get rid of the rules themselves.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: So all by yourself, you’re going to destroy
every government; in the world.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Easier than that, buddy. I’ll get them to
destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is
going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to
the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing… Pretty soon
everyone’s involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these
guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules,
no law, everybody free to do what they want.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Including rape, pillage, murder.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Sure, if that’s what you want. Why not? It’s
all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the
decline and fall of civilization as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: And here I thought “anarchy” was just
something cool to put on a Tshirt.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Come on, Xander. You used to stand for
something. What happened to you, man? I thought you’d get it.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Don’t you see, X? For the betterment of
humanity, he’s going to start World War Three.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: He’s a regular humanitarian. And all this
time I thought he was just a tool.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: You both could have been a part of it. You
could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of
–</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Oh just shoot us already. I’m sorry I
asked.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Screw you too, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: Hurry up, kill him!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Hey! We’re on your side!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Petra! Tell them something!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: How’s Ivan?</p>
<p><strong>ivan 2</strong>: He is okay.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Thanks for coming, man, you guys were right
on time.</p>
<p><strong>ivan 2</strong>: We are always on time. Two have escaped, in
truck.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Yorgi and Kirill.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo
with them.</p>
<p><strong>ivan 2</strong>: Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he send
something for you.</p>
<p><strong>ivan 2</strong>: We’ll be right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Did you do your homework?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: If they launch it, I know how to bring it
back.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Let’s do this.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Where’s he headed?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: He owns a big industrial complex on the
river. He’ll launch it from there.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: They’re coming! Get back there.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You get down! I’ll take care of this
fool!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: No! Don’t shoot! He’s hiding behind the nerve
agent!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Goddamit! He’s gonna stop playing around
soon and shoot something valuable!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Let’s see what my man put together.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Where’d the damn truck go?!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Go to the water, it’s that way!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Toadies right behind.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Let me.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Fantastic options.</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: I’ve got it, go! Cover me!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: A piece of shrapnel hit me.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m sick of that guy. Let’s stop playing
nice.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: What are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I guess the surgeon general was right.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: He’s shut out the communication circuit!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You can’t talk to it?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: No, it’s like a safety. We are going to have
to access the manual controls.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: A manual control on a moving torpedo. This
day keeps getting better and better.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Radio Ivan! Tell him what’s going down! Have
them evacuate downtown!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: It’s running three meters down. Twenty
knots.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: It has to surface to release the nerve
agent, right?</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: By then it’s too late! The only way to safely
dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break
down and dissipate!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up
underwater!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: There it is! Hold it steady!</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Petra!</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: Xander! It’s coming up!</p>
<p><strong>yorgi</strong>: This is going to be exciting, buddy! Front
row seats to the apocalypse! Come on, sing with me! “I am an Antichrist
/ I am an anarchist / I… wan-na be… Anarchy!”</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Thought you bought the farm down there, X.
Glad as hell to see you.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: I’m pretty happy to see me too. So are you
done with me yet?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You’ve kept up your end of the bargain,
I’ll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a
decent agent.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: But I hate cops, remember? Except for
her.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there.
You’re a hero. Don’t be afraid to join the good guys.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Who says you’re the good guys?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: You know what they say, the only way to
change the system is from the inside.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: Oh yeah? Why don’t we start by taking this
thing off my ankle? The poison needles?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: On come on, X. Did you really think we were
that barbaric?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: No needles, huh? What about the acid
bath?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: All for show. Just a psychological mind
game to get you to do the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You’re a jerk-off, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: We’ll be talking soon, you’ll see. You’ll
be back.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: I can’t believe my mission is finally over. I
don’t even know what to do with myself.</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: You can’t welch on me now. We had a
deal.</p>
<p><strong>petra</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>xander</strong>: It’s about your next mission. You need to be
debriefed.</p>
