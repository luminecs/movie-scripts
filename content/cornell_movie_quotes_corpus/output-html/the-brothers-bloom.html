<p><strong>narrator</strong>: As far as con man stories go, I think I’ve
heard them all. Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers, tales drawn long and
tall. But if one bears a bookmark in the confidence man’s tome, twould
be that of Penelope, and of the brothers Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At ten and thirteen Bloom and Stephen</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: had been through several foster
families.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Mischief moved them on in life, and moving
kept them close.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen Bloom, and
both had more than most.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Another home, another main street. Stephen
looked around, then summed the burgh up thusly:</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Bloom, we’ve hit a one hat town.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: One theater. One car wash. One cafe. One
park. One cat. Which, through some mishap, had one leg.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Sweet Jesus. Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: One school, which meant one tight- knit
group of local well-off kids.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Their pocket-change bought rocket
pops,</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The brothers,</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Pixie Stix.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: They were the `they’. All well loved,
rooted, happy as you please.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The playground bourgeoisies.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Could he simply</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Talk to her!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Just drop his fears and go? Leave his
brother in the woods, and join the children?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You shuffle when you’re thinking something
through. So whatcha thinking?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: This wasn’t really true. Cause in the root
of Stephen’s psyche, something now began. A seed of grand epiphany. A
hook. A tale.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: A plan.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A fiction made for profit, in which both
boys played a part. A simple con in fifteen steps.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: And this is where we start.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And then, as if a curtain had been pulled
back from the sky… Some barrier within the younger Bloom was broken.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: So Bloom performed his role in Stephen’s
story to a T.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And being who he wasn’t, could be as he
wished to be.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Oh - kay. How’s it going on the playground
front?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s great.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: So, on to step eleven, then. The Tale. You
tell them -</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Must the numbers rattle on? Must the
fiction end?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I think I need more time to win their-</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Bloom. They’re not your friends. They’re
part of this, and this aint real. Remember, it’s a con. And when it’s
done, we’ve just got us. And we’ll be moving on. So, the tale. You tell
them there’s a</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: hermit in the woods. A one eyed, steel
toothed vagabond…</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: …with blood red eyes?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: That’s good. He stopped you coming home
from school…</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: …and told me of a cave.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What kind of cave?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: A cave of wonders.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Pffft ha.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Shut up, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: At noon on every Sunday, there appears a ball
of light, which flutters like a butterfly…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: A will-o-whisp?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s right. It guides you</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: …if you can keep up…</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: …to where the treasures lay.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: So where’s this cave?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah, where?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Ah-hah. The hermit didn’t say. He got this
greedy glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech… and said he’d tell for
thirty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>excited boy</strong>: Well that’s just two bucks each!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: So Sunday came…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and straight from church, into the woods
Bloom led.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: They stopped. Their hearts leapt. There it
was.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Just like the hermit said!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: For just one moment, Bloom forgot himself
and ran too fast.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: They didn’t catch the will-o-wisp, but
didn’t really care.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: It seems to me that in the end, the perfect
con is where each one involved gets just the thing they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Our fledgling thieves were satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The children’s parents, less so.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A bitter ending? Maybe. But there’s
sweetness in the mix.</p>
<p><strong>box #6</strong>: “Cut % O’Henry’s”</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: `O’Henry’s’ was the town’s one dry clean
shop.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: So how’s it feel?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In truth, young Bloom won’t know for
twenty years just how he felt.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Let `em melt.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: He gets the scarab, you get the money, I
get the girl… so in the end, everyone gets everything he wants.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god are you…
oh god he’s dead, Victor’s dead… you’ve killed us! We had it he was
right it was all in the bag and now we’re dead, why? Why, you stupid son
of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>charleston</strong>: Cause the Turk was right. After seeing
her, after that night on the airstrip, after Cairo everything changed,
and he couldn’t see the play through that one milky eye, but the Turk
was right about one thing, that there’s nothing beautiful about money.
She’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: This isn’t happening…</p>
<p><strong>charleston</strong>: He’ll never have her now. She’s free.
And I’ll never see her in scarlet again, her chestnut hair, but it’s
worth the money and my job and his life and the rest of my life that
she’s free.</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Charleston. I can’t be here…</p>
<p><strong>charleston</strong>: You’re not here. Neither of us are. It’s
Mowcher’s gun.</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Mowcher is at the bottom of the Spree with
a cowl in his neck!</p>
<p><strong>charleston</strong>: They won’t find him for a week, and the
Albino will chalk it up to Davey, he won’t talk. We’re clean.</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Listen to you - four months ago you were an
investment banker! Now you’re nothing. The Scarab’s lost. The money’s
gone. It’ll rot in the Peruvian earth. It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>charleston</strong>: The man named Charleston you met nine
months and a thousand years ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead. If
we see each other again it’ll be as strangers. As for the money… let it
rot.</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You’re a genius, Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We’re a genius, Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Tastes like tin foil.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: So does real blood. Buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: “Four months and a thousand years ago.”
That’s Kipling, isn’t it? He stole that from Kipling.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: Make way, make room for the brothers
Bloom!</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: Nine months, six countries, three faked
deaths, for one mark. You’re a beautiful antique, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Proust.</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: One thing baffles me. The entire con would
have fallen apart if Charleston had walked away. How did you know he’d
pull the trigger?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Just think of any card. Got one?</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: But if I do it enough, eventually it’ll
work on someone. And then it’ll be the best card trick in the world.</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: It’s true you never work with the same
crew twice?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: Well shit. Except for the uh, for her?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: La Chinoise?</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>romanian</strong>: Yeah, I’m pretty big into anime.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Our fifth Beatle. She knows the ins and the
outs, and so far as I can tell, speaks three words of English.</p>
<p><strong>the chink</strong>: Jameson.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Ice?</p>
<p><strong>the albino</strong>: So she’s with you and Bloom till the
end.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Just till the wind changes.</p>
<p><strong>the turk</strong>: Where is Bloom?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: There you are. Hiding?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’ve been learning. Stephen likes to talk
about you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Did he tell you the cave story?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What else did he tell you?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m not going to tell it as good as Stephen.
You two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a
merchant marine freighter and ended up in St. Petersburg, where you
spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the
Diamond Dog. And he was your Fagin and Stephen was his Artful Dodger,
but it ended suddenly and badly.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen took his eye out with an antique
rapier.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Why did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: And then the Brothers Bloom lit out on their
own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves. Sounds romantic.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It does.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You want to know how Stephen did it? With
Charleston?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s not the first thing on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He positioned me in the same spot where,
seven years ago, Charleston’s wife stood and told him she was
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: This is the end. Charelston, you’ve always
been a dunce.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: So in the end, everyone gets everything he
wants.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s what he does, he writes his cons the
way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and imbedded
symbolism and shit. And he wrote me as a vulnerable anti- hero. And
that’s why you think you want to kiss me. It’s a con.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Who doesn’t? That’s the big 2.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We missed the sunrise. That would’ve been
nice.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Back to the swamps!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: `Do we have to go through this again.’</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Then you make a show of putting on your
jacket and say `no I mean it this time Stephen, this time I’m really
out.’</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Then you say `let’s have a drink, and in the
morning Bloom you’ll have come to your senses’</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: That’s a major design flaw in fake blood,
by the way.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: `and we’ll be moving on.’</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Real blood turns brown after a half
hour.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Listen to me, Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: This scotch costs more than your suit.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: And the flask stopped a bullet from a black
powder rifle at Appomattox.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: That’s my new favorite camel.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I hate you. I hate this life, I hate it, I
hate that you won’t fucking listen to me for one goddamn second. Just
listen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Tell me what you want.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Why? So you can write me a role in a story
where I get it? You’re not listening to me. I want a real… thing, I
wanna do things how I don’t know are gonna work out, a, I, want, a…</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: You want an unwritten life.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I want an unwritten life! Aauuugghh god!</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Sorry bud. I’m dry.</p>
<p><strong>title card</strong>: Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: She’s right, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Why are you here, Stephen?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Put on your face, let’s eat.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The Chink.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How’d the Chink find me?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: How’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I’ve done a lot of thinking the past three
months. You don’t want out. You think you do but you don’t. Here,
c’mere. I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m quits, Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well lemme get my jacket.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Looks like an etching from a Bronte
novel.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Big money. Inheritance. Dad died early, Mom
died two years ago after ten years fighting an illness that I can’t
pronounce.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Look out.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What am I doing here, Stephen? I have one
rule, and you’ve never even tested it.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Stick with me.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No women. One rule. You know we don’t do
women, I don’t, and it’s not a morality thing or- a thing- it’s,
whatever it is it doesn’t matter what it is, that’s just our rule. So
what are we,</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Penelope Stamp. Thirty three. Lived at home
her whole life.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: An eccentric shut-in rich bitch. You’re not
helping your case.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: She’s bored, a seed in the snow. We’re
going to put her through a grand adventure, bring her to life.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: So this is the big plan. Lure me back into
things with some beautiful intriguing elusive girl, stir up old memories
with the prospect of redemption and rebirth. Seriously Stephen. Amateur
night.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: It’s actually pretty simple. We’re
brothers, antique dealers, perusing the Americas for antiquities en
route to someplace exciting via luxury steamer, say Greece. You tie into
her and work your magic…</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: …and so that’s how it ends, in Mexico, a
burst of violence then a moment of truth on the beach. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’ve got something up your sleeve. This is
about me, right? Somehow.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: This might not be something you know, but
they’ve all been about you. Maybe that’s why they’ve none of them been
perfect, I’ve never been able to give you what you really want.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I want to be outta all this. So by
definition, this is not going to give me what I want.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I will never approach you to do another con
again. Let’s make it a red Schwinn.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: There are less painful ways to cut into a
mark.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk. Score
to beat is 7.9. Keep your head in the game, the Chinese judge is
tough.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This is a banana seat, man!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: There’s actually a knack to this. You want to
avoid dying or breaking anything that won’t grow back, but you don’t
want to roll out of it and come up roses. If you’re trying to fast track
into a mark’s sympathies, there’s nothing quite as efficient as having
your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in. I
usually like to try for a dislocated shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The Chink had it - I’m telling him, I know,
thank you - in her report, I missed it. This is actually kind of great,
I’ll tell you why.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You missed it?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Dostoevsky was an epileptic.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: His seizures were preceded by an
enlightened euphoria, a sort of opening of his spiritual eye.</p>
<p><strong>61 continued: 61</strong>: STEPHEN</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The next step is to figure out a way to
insinuate yourself into their personal life.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I think they took my car. Could you drive
me home?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Uh. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m Penelope Stamp.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Engagement. Find a connection with your mark
through conversation.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: S’ ok.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Nice area. Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: This car is like riding in a huge
marshmallow.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Having now deftly set your hook in the mark’s
psyche, this would be the perfect time to tug the line,</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Get invited in for coffee, and tell them the
full tale.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: For the bike, and the whole, thing. This
was a big shit sandwich. Ok. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: However, there are advantages to playing it
cool. Letting it lie for a day or two, then casually re- establish
contact.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I realized… I should have… invited you in…
for coffee… right?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: …didn’t really have anyone except each other
growing up, and our father was in the antique business, he had a shop in
Charleston. So we stuck together, my brother Stephen and me, we and just
took over the shop when dad died. Then we realized one day, we saw the
dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic
countries all over the world, and there was a, almost a scent they had,
when they’d come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we
were nineteen, the air would, like before a rain, the ions would line
up, and you could just smell midnight trains to Paris and steamer ships
and Calcutta bazaars, and we made the decision, we just did it, that we
want to have that sort of life. So we did, and we’ve been travelling and
treasure hunting the world ever since, and could you, I’m sorry, stop
doing - that, you’re, I’m, ok. Alright, look.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m really bad at talking to people.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I told you, that’s alright. You want me to
go?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No! I want to talk to you. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: So what kind of stuff do you do?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Nothing. Maybe you should go.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Alright. I’m just gonna finish my coffee
first.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I collect hobbies. I see someone doing
something I like, and I get books and learn how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Hm. Anything interesting?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No. I know a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You just learned this stuff, here by
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Kinda sad.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No. So you just thought, `so I want to learn
this and this,’ and you just did it? How do you plan to use all these
skills?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I dunno. I’m not a planner. I just do
stuff. Here, look at this watermelon. It’s a camera. You can make a
pinhole camera out of anything hollowish and dark.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s gotta warp the image though, right?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: No, yeah it does. That’s what - the Taj
Majal taken by a fat tourist with diarrhea and a point- and-shoot camera
can be the flattest, dullest, “here’s us at the Taj Majal,” “Oh lovely
lets go stick our thumbs up our asses” picture. But you can look at the
most menial everyday thing, and depending on how your pinhole camera
eats the light, it’s warped and peculiar and imperfect. It’s not
reproduction, it’s storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s a lie that tells the truth.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I dunno about truth. A photograph is a
secret about a secret. The more it tells you, the less you know.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What’s changed between now and twenty minutes
ago? Cause this is kinda like a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Huh. Well shit.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well, I should, uh, it’s late. So. I meet a
lot of people in my job I have to professionally act interested in. It’s
a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Are you coming back?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well next time I’m in town. We’re taking a
steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few
months.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Goodbye Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I need another day with her.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: You’ll have two weeks on the boat.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I need another day to get her on the boat,
she isn’t hooked. That bit I skipped where we were talking in the
backyard, it was ten minutes on the optics of lensless photography, we
didn’t really talk.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: It isn’t the talking that hooked her.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I think you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Hi. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You left this money in my kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah, I didn’t want it, but thanks.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Oh. Hey, where’s this boat going?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Why did you decide to come?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Well I’d never been to Greece. Or Europe.
Or outside New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It just seems like a big leap. From where you
were at yesterday to being a world traveler.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It looked like fun. I wanted to do it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: A new hobby.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Penelope, this is my brother Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Pleased to make your acquaintance. Bloom’s
told me about you, you’re the epileptic photographer?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: This is my personal secretary and masseuse,
Mrs. Yuengling.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yuengling like the beer?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Heh. No. So what are your plans in
Greece?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t plan.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You named the Chink `Yuengling?’</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I was writing in a bar. And she doesn’t
drink, how does she know a Philly beer?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: She knows a lot of stuff. Was that who I
thought it was on the East deck this morning?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Yes it was. Did he spot you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You look very nice.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I make cameras out of watermelons.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Lonely.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Lucky guess.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How was it lonely?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Fishing for an entertaining childhood
anecdote that encapsulates my adult issues?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well it’s funny how everyone’s usually got
one.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: When I turned six I started getting
allergies, hayfever, rashes, really bad. So my mom took me into the
doctor, and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on
your back with all the different toxins, to see which ones you’re
allergic to. The next day I came in, the doctor lifted up my shirt, and
my back looked like a patch of oily, moldy, blackish green double- puff
marshmallows. I was allergic to everything. So they sealed the house
with plastic and a special ventilation system, and I spent my entire
childhood and adolescence indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It wasn’t `til I was nineteen they
discovered what I was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the
hypodermic needle was made out of. Then I was going to leave, but my mom
got sick. So I stayed. And she stayed sick, a long time.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Do you feel cheated?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The trick to not feeling cheated is to
learn how to cheat. So I decided this wasn’t a story about a miserable
girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies wasting her
life on a dying person she sometimes hated. It was about a girl who
could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing. And do
anything she decided to do. And love the person she was trapped with. So
I told myself that story until it became true. Now did doing that let me
escape a wasted life, or did it just blind me so I wouldn’t want to
escape it? I don’t know. But either way, I was the one telling my own
story. So I don’t feel cheated.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: And a magician is just an actor playing
the part of a magician. My compliments.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Who is that man? You avoided him earlier
on the deck.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t know, but he’s carrying a knife up
his sleeve and wearing a cape. Do me a favor and steer clear of him.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I went through a phase when I was mildly
obsessed with the Bolero.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: I didn’t mean to startle you.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Apologies, but the deck was dark, and I
had to approach. It’s been such a time since I’ve encountered the
Brothers Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You’re in antiques?</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if you
know the true nature of the men you travel with?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It isn’t a Spanish band, but they’ll do their
best.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How’d you find her?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling? She found
us.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: A few years back, when we hit the top of our
art dealing game, she just appeared.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I like her.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I invited him, sit down. This ship’s too
small to dance around each other for a week, we might as well have it
out now. Bloom. Sit. Penelope, do you know our friend?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Only as the creepy Frenchman.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Book-learned. You know languages but
not accents, my dear. I am Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at your
service.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Also known in certain professional circles as
the Curator.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Pleased to make your acquaintance. What do
you do?</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: I’m a curator, presently for the
National Museum in Prague. And yourself?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m an epileptic photographer.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Good for you. Boys? What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We have a legitimate antique reselling
business.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Baissez le rideau, la farce est
jouee.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We’ve gone straight, Max.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Pardon, but you do not ascend to the
grand heights of the Brothers Bloom only to toss it all and sell terra
cotta to blue haired weekend antiquers.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We did. Eat your waffles.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: But Mademoiselle appears… confused.
Perhaps she is unawares?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Eat your waffles, fat man.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are in
fact the two most highly respected art smugglers in the western
world?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Were. We’ve been on the straight for three
years. So that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Well, if that is that, then that is
indeed that. As you say.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Your name’s Melville?</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Maxmillion Melville, Esquire.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I couldn’t
place it, this ship is the Fidele, which was the ship in Melville’s
novel “The Confidence Man.” So that’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I know you like to throw those clever little
details in, but you’ve gotta watch that shit with her Stephen. She had a
lot of time alone in that house, and she used it. She did the best
Double Dutch Queens I’ve ever seen up on the deck last night.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed cards.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: She had them in her purse and cut them in
while I was folding my napkin.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s what I’m saying. She’s different, she
knows, sometimes it feels like she knows everything. Doesn’t that worry
you?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: No. But something about her is worrying you
plenty.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: She feels like one of your characters.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The day I con you is the day I die,
Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I know that. How did you get the Belgian, on
our budget?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: He’s beautiful, right?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I didn’t expect him to actually be
Belgian.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I’m not sure he is. I’m to bed.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Shut up. I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Smugglers. It’s like an adventure story.
Whose idea was it to go straight?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mine. Stephen always loved the life. Then he
was almost killed on a run to Jakarta, two thugs with heads like canned
hams worked him beyond all reason.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Have at thee, you ham headed bastards!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: And I called it, that was it.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Scary.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He loved the idea
that we were internationally infamous art smugglers, but I think deep
down, same as me, he felt like we were putting on a persona, faking
it.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Telling a story.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He’d love to die on a job. Cornered at
midnight on a run to Jakarta. That’s his dream, to tell his story so
well it fulfills itself. It somehow would make it finally real for
him.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That’s kinda the thing we all want,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Trying to get something real by telling
yourself stories is a trap. Trust me on that one.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Best of luck with the antiquing, boys.
Au revoir, Chinois.</p>
<p><strong>86 continued: 86</strong>: THE CURATOR</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: My French is a little rusty, but I believe he
just told you `my offer stands.’</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He came out of nowhere last night.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Whatever’s in his pipe, it made me
thick.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh lord. What has he got?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: An 8th century prayer book.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: From his museum in Prague, stashed in the
castle.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: A book of hours.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap out of
me so I don’t know it that well. So that’s what he does, he makes pieces
in his collections disappear, then sells them off via a trusted
middleman.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s what he does.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Wonder who’s his fence?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Probably his Spanish guy, right? Did he say
who’s buying?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: An Argentinian. Argentine?
Argentinian?</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: A gentleman from Argentina. He’s quite
sick, cancer in his bones, and desperate for sentimental reasons to own
this piece while he may.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He’ll sell it to a middleman for one
million, US. The Argentin…a guy will pay two point five.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Is he legit?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The Curator? That’s a relative term. He’s
telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m sorry you had to deal with that guy.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The train station.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Where’s the train going?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Prague.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well first off, we don’t have a million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I do, I’ve got, that’s whatever. I mean a
real reason.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This is real, it’s dangerous, it could go
very bad.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I think a little real danger might suit
me. I’m gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: PENELOPE</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This is not an adventure story.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What are you talking about? It totally
is.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Take it easy. She’s having fun, that’s the
point of this.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: She’s making a flag for our “smugglers gang,”
man. She made me learn a secret smugglers handshake. Unhealthy. This
afternoon, when she was writing, in the observation car? A letter? A
journal? No. She is getting way too into this.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: What Smugglers Song?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You know, the one from whatsit, the Disney
thing, that Smuggler Song, the `We’re a band of smugglers hey, la la la
la la, we smuggle by night and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho ho,
smugglers…’ there, this isn’t… there isn’t a Smuggler Song, is there?
Ok. She made up a Smuggler Song. With hand motions.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The whole point of this was to sweep her
off her feet. Let her enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: While it lasts.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Nothing lasts.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Smuggling. From the snack car.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Fourteen gins? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>the chink</strong>: Jameson.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m not paying for that.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Ice?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: She made up the Smuggler Song.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you taken this
train before?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: So this is all like fuckin `whatever’ to
you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I usually drink with the Chink in the snack
car, play cards.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: With the who?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Mrs. Yeungling. That’s her smuggler
nickname.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: That’s offensive.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I think if it were offensive to her, she’d
let us know.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Do I get a smuggler nickname?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I think you’re constipated. In your fuckin
soul.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You’ve got a big load of grumpy petrified
poop up your ass, I’m just calling you out on it. Yeah I’m pretending
I’m a smuggler, so you know what? I’m a fuckin smuggler. If that’s your
thing, fuckin tell it like you own it. When you’ve got a spotlight in
front of your feet, man, fuckin jump into it and dance the shit out of
it. Stop fuckin thinking so much. Enjoy the fuckin ride. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Look, I’m not-</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Shh. I love thunderstorms.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Nite.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That’s the big 2.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The last time I was in Prague, I was in
love.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What was she like?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Pale skin. Long feet. So.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Bloom and I will secure us lodging,</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Mrs. Yeungling will scout the castle
museum.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: You will go to the bank, that wire should
have cleared if you put it in at Athens.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Cash?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Only movie thugs and Russians deal in
suitcases of cash. Draw a certified check.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Who the hell is that?! Who is it?!</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Candy-Gram. It’s us, Max.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Who the hell are you, what do you want,
who the hell!!!!??</p>
<p><strong>bloom stephen</strong>: Max! Max! It’s us, Bloom, Max! Max!
It’s Stephen and Stephen, Jesus, Max, easy, Bloom, easy, whoa, Christ,
whoa! whoa now!</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Here, off the Basilica, are offices of
administration, and beneath those, an otherwise inaccessible section of
catacombs. And the book.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Administrative offices. So how do you steal
the book?</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: The book is already stolen. The
stealing is in the bureaucracy, in the filing, red tape. As far as the
museum is concerned, the book does not exist. I am the curator, I walk
in, pinch the copy girl’s baboosh, put the book in a briefcase and walk
out. Tomorrow, say, at two.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Today.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Today is not a good day.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Tomorrow. Now what about this
Argentinian.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise Belguta
Rioso. I get his file.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Gin is slow death, man.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We’ll see you back at the hotel. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: From a private collection on the island
of Ikaria. That one.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Who painted it?</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Why is it the last thing you see every
night, and the first thing you see every morning?</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: That’s a story. You have a minute?</p>
<p><strong>108 continued: 108</strong>: THE CURATOR</p>
<p><strong>108 continued: 108</strong>: THE CURATOR</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Right. Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: Au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You aren’t constipated. You’re scared.
What are you scared of?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: Bloom. How long has it been? Tea. Can
you believe that? Tea? Been a long while.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: If I call Stephen down he’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: Well then please don’t call Stephen
down. Look at you, you’re terrified. C’mon now, look. Take a look. I’m
an old man with no depth perception. You don’t have to be scared of
me.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Is this profundity? Cause you can skip
it.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: Ha! Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: You probably won’t believe I loved you
boys very much.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’re going to take your hand away or I’m
going to break your arm, there’s nothing between.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: But love, you know. We know, folks like
us, you can always blink and realize that it’s a fiction, and like Peter
walking on water or Wiley Coyote running off a cliff, if you look down
in doubt you’ll fall. That’s the price of our lives, the wax in our
wings. One day Stephen’s going to fall. It may be glorious, but he’s
going to fall hard and he won’t be there to tell you what to do and
protect you. When he’s gone, remember me.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I’m sorry I wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You can’t always be there.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: No, I guess can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That was a real tonal shift. The Curator’s
tale.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I’m a big fan of tonal shifts. I didn’t
write it for him, though.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He made it up on the spot?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Max?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: We’re a little early…</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The Golem came for him. In my dream.
Crawled out of the painting and killed him in a horrible way.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well at least he had the decency to just skip
out on us, not do something tacky like fake his own death.</p>
<p><strong>the curator</strong>: You’re a little early.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I don’t get it. If he was hightailing it he
could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book,
and had some traveling money. Well. Back to antiquing. Nothing gained,
nothing lost. And you got to see Prague, which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You should stay in the city for awhile, they
have these amazing puppet show opera things-</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s my fault. I can’t believe I left you
alone with him.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The check was cashed yesterday afternoon,
he’d have deposited it in a Swiss account. I’m sorry Pen.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What a waste.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No. No no. Can’t you see what happened here,
there is no book, we’ve been swindled -</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: But maybe there is, maybe it’s real, we
don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s not real, it’s a con.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s my money, I’m going to find out for
sure. He gave us every piece of information we need.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We’d need to clear the administrative
offices. Some sort of disruption.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: C’mon. Help me break into this castle.
It’ll be fun.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: She’s an artist with nitroglycerin. It’s
kind of her thing.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I feel like I want to know more about
her.</p>
<p><strong>bloom stephen</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Check the tat.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The literal translation is something about
water cranes, but essentially it means “When you’re done with something,
blow it up.”</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: There’s a smoke detector in these empty
rooms in the east tower. So we plant and set off a tiny - TINY tiny,
tiny charge.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: So straight down the corridor, again, tell me
where.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Second left, third right, access hatch
behind the copier, I need to sleeeeeeep…</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The abort code if we need to abort is “corned
beef.” For some reason.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Bloom, I need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You know what I feel?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Horny?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Scared. All my big talk. But this isn’t a
story, it’s real. Fuckin scary.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Alright?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: For the record, I’m still against this. Why
send her in alone?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Because going in alone is a very important
thing to do. She’s walking into a zero security tourism office during a
fire drill and taking a five hundred dollar manuscript replica from a
utility crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a file clerk asks if she’s
lost. Which isn’t even going to happen. She’s in position.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Uh-</p>
<p><strong>the chink</strong>: Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Don’t do it don’t do it Penelope don’t-</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: They’re locking down the castle, she won’t
get in.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: To ze back, no panic, to ze
back…</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Pen! Don’t - abort! Corned beef! Corned
beef!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m in Prague. I burned a man’s lips off
to break into a castle in Prague.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Wait. Wait, we’re fine. She’s fine. If the
soldiers find her wandering the halls they’ll assume she’s a clerk,
they’ll just shoo her out. So as long as she doesn’t do anything
suspicious, she’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The Chief of Police.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: It has been a privilege, madame, to
behold even briefly such a strong, beautiful flower.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Thank you sir, I will not soon forget your
kindness.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Let her sleep. Train doesn’t leave till
eight.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That was real.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Fuckin scary.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: An apple?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah, but it was part of an epiphany.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Oh-kay. We’re rendezvousing with Senor
Rioso’s guys here, on an isolated beach just south of the Mexican port
town Tampico. A simple handoff. Penelope and Yeungling will stay with
the car, Bloom and I will do the handing.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You guys seem a little tense.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Well I’m not thrilled they set this in
Mexico. There could be legitimate reasons, but Mexico’s - and I don’t
want to simplistically vilify an entire country, but Mexico’s a horrible
place. So we’ll be careful.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Is this going to be more dangerous than I
think, tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah. You should sleep at the hotel tonight,
I’ll stay with Stephen at the beach house. You’ll need sleep.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m really happy right now. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Right now I am.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: The last box in our last con. Let them
begin the beguine. How’s it feel?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: She’s something special, Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Can I…</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Be angry at me, you son of a bitch. Don’t
be pathetic. Make you? Jesus. I told you not to fall for her-</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m not gonna do this.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I know what I’ve gotta do. I’ve gotta talk to
you. Are you wearing shoes?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Bloom. What?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: My brother and I are con men. All things
considered, we might be the most respected con man team working today.
And everything since you hit me with your Lamborghini, all of this, it’s
all fake. It’s all a con.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No, we were going to blow you off tomorrow
using the cackle bladder, it’s a, term, we have actors playing the
Argentina guy’s men, when we showed up the deal would go bad, they would
open fire on us, Stephen and I would pretend to be shot using blood
packets, squibs. That’s - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake
blood in chicken bladders, so… So you’d escape with the Chink, she’d
send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: But that’s not how this one’s going to end. I
love you now, and I want to get you out of this. I’m going to do what I
have to do to get you out of this, away from all this for good. Are you
ready?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen’s gone into town to prep the
Argentina actors. Your money’s at his place.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Money? I don’t want the money, let’s just
leave.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: You have to switch it on at the base.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: So I’ve told her our whole play. And I’m
here. To take her money back. How’s that make you feel?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This isn’t the ending you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: It doesn’t matter now. This is the way it
ends. So let’s get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I ate it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Give me the money, Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t want the money.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He’s not going to keep a single piece of
you.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I’m sorry you fell in love with her. But
she’s a mark. And all of this, all of it is a con. Every moment you
shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in
love. That’s what you’re afraid of, right? That you don’t know the
difference? Or maybe that there is no difference. That that’s what love
is.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: No. You’re too scared to leave. You’re
scared to ride off into a sunset that isn’t painted tarpaulin, cause
real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights. If
you were ready for that, you wouldn’t be here. The money is in my
bedroom. Right behind me. But in my story you don’t get the money or the
sunset or the girl.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Bloom. Let’s just go. Please.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Tastes like tin foil.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Bloom…</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Hey. I think that was the most honest
conversation we’ve ever had. You actually connected on a few of those
punches.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Did you expect me to do it? To come here
tonight, end it the way you wrote it? Or were you really disappointed I
didn’t run off with her?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I was disappointed. But I wasn’t
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I let you do your monologue, but you wanna
know why I did it? I did it so she’d never want to see me again. To get
her away from all this for good.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The Chink.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How did you find the Chink?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: She gave me her cell when we got to
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I didn’t even know she had one.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I think she’s kind of selective in who she
gives the number to.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Why are you here, Penelope?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Why did you decide to stay with your
brother instead of coming with me in Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Everything Stephen said that night was
true.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’ve been doing a lot of thinking the past
three months. I want you to consider something.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Go away. Everything Stephen said was true. I
was just playing you as a mark. Everything between us, none of it was
real.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Pick up… c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How quickly can you get to Ferentino?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Uh… Nine-ish?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: So she comes back wanting to work with us.
Honestly? I think we’d be lucky to have her. If you called me to hear my
opinion on the matter. Which I’m getting the feeling you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I did what I did in Mexico to get her out of
all this. I would rather die than bring her into the con.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: So maybe you want to tell me what I’m doing
in Ferentino.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You knew she’d come back. What did you figure
she was good for, another million?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: One point seven five.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: We will play her again, one last con, but not
for money. I’m gonna tell you how this one’s gonna end. You built us
into this, you’re gonna fly us out, end it so she’s done with all of us.
End it all so it can’t start up again.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: You want me to plan a con whose sole
purpose is to blow her off for good?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I love her. You owe me this. I don’t want to
turn her into me.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: So what’s the next job?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Before we do the next job, we need to
liquidate our assets from the last job.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: But you’ve got-</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Your money from the last job, well that’s
profit, not capital, the three of us have already split it up. So step
one: sell the book of hours.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I thought it was fake.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: With all your random expertise we couldn’t
risk a flat out fake. It isn’t worth two point five million, we could
maybe catch four hundred grand for it, but it’s real. Who’d we buy it
from?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Minskie.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Perfect, we’ll sell it right back to
him.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Well there’s Demarco or Boyer. Or Roche, if
we want to go state-side.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: All traceable. With Minskie out we’d have
to go deep black market if we wanted to be a hundred percent clear.
There’s only one place that’s deep enough for that.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Russia. It’s like `cancer’, I don’t even like
saying the word.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We’re obviously not going to deal with real
Russians. They’ll be our guys in a phony set up, they’ll take our phony
book and give her phony cash, a closed loop. Safe and simple.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Our “Russians” have arrived.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Who’d you get, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: To play the “Russians?”</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: My boys.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t understand. Tell me so I understand.
Three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard-</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: We need someone who can pass for the
Russian mob to buy our fake book. The Dog’s got his big store right here
in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Alright, fuckin stop. You want this to finish
in St. Petersburg, you want this to end with the Dog for some what
thematic something? Fine but don’t tell it like a story, let’s say it.
Twenty three years ago and I can still smell, that blood red apartment
of his, the smell of that place. I hate him Stephen but this isn’t that,
this is I don’t trust him.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: What’s he gonna do? Steal our fake money?
I’ve thought this one out, believe me. And we can’t end it without him.
Trust me. It’s gonna be ok.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: Stephen, still the grand architect with
your symbols. Red for temptation, white for salvation.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s trash. There’s visible cross hatching in
Franklin’s eye.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: Hm. I’ll be damned. Ruskies wouldn’t be
caught dead handing over a rag bag like this, it should be a steel
attache.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: This’ll do. We’ll do the drop off at your
store. Make it scary, think a movie version of the Russian mafia, but
don’t hassle her.</p>
<p><strong>diamond dog</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: So. Our fake Russian attack. One small
charge will simulate a bullet hit, and blow out the back window.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You’ve been awful quiet.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Tomorrow it all starts.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: She gives the Dog the book, he gives her the
fake money. This is taking too long.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: He hassled me. Took forever looking the
book over, haggled the price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Alright. Let’s get the hell out of
Russia.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Yeungling went to get another car.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Where’s Stephen?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We don’t know. He was gone.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Who’s got him?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: The Russians.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen, god please what’s happening. I don’t
know what to do. I don’t know Stephen please. Please. What’s happening.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Where does she get all these cars?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: If you know what’s happening, now would be a
really good time to speak up.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom. Yes, ok.</p>
<p><strong>all the cooks</strong>: Blooooom!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok. So I’ve got “We
are all assholes in our own theatrical enterprises.” You sure?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: And then it end with “Goodbye shit head.”</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Shit head?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: But it is different meaning in Mandarin, uh,
endearing. “Shit head” if you have affection for shit.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What did it mean?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What did it say?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: “We’re all of us marks in our own cons.” And
she said goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I still can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: That the Chink fell for a car bomb? Neither
can I.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What? Oh, oh god do you think she faked
it? So the Russians would think she was dead?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This wasn’t Russians. This was done by an old
mentor of ours who wants us off the map. He has an apartment in
St. Petersburg. So this is, yeah. I’ve gotta go back to that apartment
to face the Dog and get my brother back. That’s how I’m gonna end
this.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: We can skip the whole you-sending-
me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to- leave-your-side-thing.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Thank Christ.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: If there are shots you run to the car and
drive, with or without me.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What’s in there? Tell me who this guy
is.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He’s just an old man.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Dog! I came back.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Moth balls.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Is that what that smell is?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s okay. Honey, it’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ask him if anyone else is here.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Nyet.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Diamond Dog? Where is the Diamond Dog?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: The Dog of Diamonds is gone.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Get the car started.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Get out! Get out of the car!!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s a ransom note. It says they have
Stephen, it says they want the money wired to a specific account, they
give a bank to do it at and a manager to ask for.</p>
<p><strong>215 continued: 215</strong>: PENELOPE</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’ll wire the money from my account, and
we’ll go get Stephen.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: It’s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’ll do it, I want to, I’ve got
plenty-</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How much are they asking for?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: One point seven five million.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Oh. Oh oh. No no NO.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: There’s another possibility that I should of,
I’m a fucking idiot. This might all be a con. By my brother. To get me -
oh god - he wanted me to face the Dog, to end it, and he gets your
money. Oh god. I’m going to be sick.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Would he do that? To you?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t know. Yes. Yes of course he
would.</p>
<p><strong>215 continued: 215</strong>: BLOOM</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: But you don’t know. Let’s transfer the
money. You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: You don’t know. This is your brother’s
life. I’m gonna wire the money.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’m so scared. Anything I can imagine finding
in there, I’m scared of.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I’m going to be here when you come
out.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen. Game’s up. Come on out. Let’s blow
this one hat town.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: No! No Bloom, freeze.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen, who is it? Is it the Dog?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Did Penelope wire the money?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: They’re calling to check right now. Don’t
move. I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Stay back!</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Please tell me this is all gonna be ok. Tell
me that’s a squib, and that’s makeup, and that you just gave me what I
always wanted and pulled off the perfect con.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: You said it, not me.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Tastes like tin foil. Alright here’s what I
want you to do. The Chink split?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Yeah. Clean exit.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Car bomb.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Good. Here’s what. Take Penelope back to
Helsinki, take that flight to Rio. Lay low like we said. Play out the
on-the-run-from- vengeful-Russians thing, that’ll be fun for her. Play
it like I’m dead, actually - that’ll add some gravity to everything,
that’ll be nice. And I’ll see you when I see you.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Soon?</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: I hope not. Last thing you need is me
hanging around. Anyway, how could I top this?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I love you. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Hey. Think of any card.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: You’re the only audience I’ve ever
needed.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Hey. Hey, it’s ok. The bridge is coming
up, we’re almost at the border. Were you dreaming about Stephen?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Pull over. Pull over!!</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: What is it? You’re scaring me-</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What did you ask the Russian kid, in the
Dog’s apartment? He said the Dog isn’t here, then what did you ask?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: How long had he been alone.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: And what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Since yesterday morning.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: This is real. They hassled you.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: Bloom-</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The Dog was gone before we got there. They
hadn’t cleared out of their apartment, they had been cleared out.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Real Russians. Took his store. They didn’t
know about his deal with us, but you haggled with them. You really sold
the book to real Russians. The Diamond Dog was gone.</p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: Let’s get the hell out of Russia.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: And they came after us. And Stephen…</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Stephen saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>penelope</strong>: And he did it so you could live. Your
brother loved you. He loved you so much. Look at me. Stephen said
something once, I got the feeling he’d rather be telling it to you. He
said there’s no such thing as an unwritten life. Just badly written
ones. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>228 continued: 228</strong>: PENELOPE</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I was thinking of something Stephen said too.
“The perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they
wanted.” Well.</p>
