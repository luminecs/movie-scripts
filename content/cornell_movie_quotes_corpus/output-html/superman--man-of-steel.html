<h1 id="supermanman-of-steel">superman–man-of-steel</h1>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What now, Jonathan?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: Hello. Welcome to LexCorp. May I
help you?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m here to see Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: And what time is your
appointment?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I don’t have an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry. Mister Luthor only
sees guests by appointment.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s very urgent. A matter of life and
death.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: Let me see if I can fit you in.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What?! I have been waiting here for three
hours and I have an appointment! Does he know Lois Lane from the Daily
Planet is here?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #2</strong>: That’s probably why he’s not coming
down.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: The parking garage. You and me, sister. I hope
your medical is all paid up.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: I can fit you in Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’d have to wait until next Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: Tuesday the twenty-third…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s three weeks from now.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: …in September.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #2</strong>: Miss Lane?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #1</strong>: If you have a business card or
something, I’d be happy to leave it for him.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No. I don’t have anything. Oh wait, I do have
this.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Look at these Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know. I took them.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I know guys who’ve been taking pictures for
fifteen years and aren’t this good.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Daily Planet, Kent speaking.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, Miss Lane. They’re in a meeting. Sure
thing, Miss Lane.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: …Has lost contact with the Constitution–</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: CHIEF! -</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: OLSEN! What they hell are you doing in my
staff meeting?! You’re not a writer, you’re a photographer and you’re
barely that! Get out of here before I have you selling papers on the
corner!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh yeah. Miss Lane called. Somebody has a
bomb in the LexCorp building.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Isn’t Lois interviewing Luthor today?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Well what are you waiting for?!</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Windy.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Hey stupid! What the-</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: I’ve worked here for six years and I’ve
never actually seen the guy before.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: SERGEANT, I trust this won’t take long. I am
trying to run a company.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Well, there is a bomb in your building,
Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: If they really wanted to kill me and were
remotely competent, I’d be dead by now. I can’t stand incompetence. I’d
like this matter finished as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>bomb squad cop</strong>: Security gives us the go-ahead. The
building is clear, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Good. We conduct a floor-by-floor building
search in two-man parties for the bomber and-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No! LexCorp is a secured facility. I can’t
have you traipsing through-</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: How are my men supposed to find the-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: There are sensitive materials and
projects-</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: With all due respect, there is a bomb in
there that could level this building-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Then I’ll build a new one.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: And what about your EMPLOYEEs?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Then I’ll hire new ones. Regardless, your
men will not be entering this facility. Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Are your men capable of finding a bomb?</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Then get it done.</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: This is not standard procedure,
Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: As far as I know you’re an industrial spy
and sent the bomb yourself to get into my building with no
witnesses–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Are you accusing me of not doing my
job!?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I have pens that cost more than you make in
a week.</p>
<p><strong>bystander #1</strong>: Look! Up in the sky…</p>
<p><strong>bystander #2</strong>: It’s a bird…</p>
<p><strong>bystander #3</strong>: It’s a plane.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Superman.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sir, I’m SERGEANT Pennington of the MPF
Bomb Unit.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Nice to meet you, SERGEANT Pennington.
There’s no bomb in this building.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: How could you know that?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I checked. There are some lead lined rooms
which isn’t unusual in a research facility but they’re secured areas. So
unless Luthor put the bomb there himself, the bomb is out here.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What? How dare you insinuate-</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Do you hear your mother calling you?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Ex-wife?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Hardly. I pay the six of them enough money
not to try a stunt like this. She’s a former EMPLOYEE I had to transfer
to a “less desirable position.”</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: All I wanted was to talk to you, Mister
Luthor. You told me you cared and I just want one more chance. I just
wanted to talk.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Did you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Hey lady! I don’t know what this schmuck
did to you but you’re gonna kill a lot of innocent people.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: …Cheryl, I know there may have been some
misunderstandings.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Transferring me to Bludhaven is hardly a
misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: How about I’ll have someone give you a call
if you leave your number with-</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’LL GIVE YOU A NUMBER!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I can give you a promotion. Maybe move you
into a nice office on the one-hundred and fourth next to the Executive
Wash Room.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: TWO!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Five hundred percent salary increase. That
oughta buy a lot of therapy.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: ONE!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Where did you get this? This is very
impressive. What is this?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: That is impressive. That is your basic
Class Six explosive with a chemical balance and wire trigger. It’s a
common weapon used by American Militias and Querac Jihads. You disarm it
by cutting the yellow, the pink and then the black.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Cheryl…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: …you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Superman, how did you know where the bomb
was?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: A heartbeat has a particular rhythm that’s
corrupted when someone is under duress, a threatening situation or
lying.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Like a polygraph.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: That’s a neat trick. Do you do parties?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s not so easy to distinguish when there
are two heartbeats, Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’m not done with you yet. You committed an
extreme invasion of my privacy by looking into my building. You can
expect to hear from my lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I don’t have time for this, Luthor. Hello,
Miss Lane. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s good to see you again but I have to
be going.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: When I have you brought up on charges and
arrested and you’ll have all the time in the world!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Lana Lang you know better than that.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Mrs. Kent we go through this every Sunday. Is
Clark here yet?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No. I think he said something about a
meeting today.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: My girl Lana, what did you bring me?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Peach cobbler.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Jonathan, what time is Clark coming?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well Metropolis time is two hours behind
but he’s never been late for a Sunday supper. I reckon he should be
here-</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: –Right on time.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hey, Pa!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lana.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Hi Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You outdid yourself, Ma. Let me help you with
those.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Jonathan, is that necessary. We have
guests.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What? Lana might as well be family. She
can unbuckle her pants if it makes her feel better.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Maybe next time.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Are you sure? I’m gonna stretch out on the
floor in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: He will not.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Isn’t that something?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It sure is. You know, Metropolis has a
beautiful sunset.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: But you can only see it when you’re in a
plane above the city. That’s why I don’t go there often. I think I’d
miss her too much.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Ma seems a little distant.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: We saw what you did this afternoon,
son.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You know how she worries. She just wants
you to be safe. You’re her only son. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’ll be careful, Pa. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You weren’t going to race off with mine,
were you?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I have some leftovers I can wrap for
you.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hmmm, homemade meat loaf, that’s tempting but
I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Are you going to walk me to my car, Clark?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Thanks for having me, Mrs Kent.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Anytime, Lana.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: They love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I know. I don’t know what I would do without
them. You know, when I fly through Metropolis I notice different things
all the time. Subtle changes nobody probably notices. But when I fly
over Smallville, it’s like nothing ever changes. It’s just the way I
left it. It’s like time doesn’t work here.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: It works. It just works very slowly. I miss
you, Clark. I miss you so much.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I miss you, too, Lana.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You really don’t know, do you? You can hear
clouds collide into each other but you are so oblivious sometimes. You
know every time your parents see you on TV they are so proud and so
terrified at the same time. When other people worry if their kids are
making friends and eating right your parents are worrying if some
super-powered goon is going to get the best of you. If you’re going to
be trapped in space or buried in a lava flow or something.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I had that lava flow under control.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You’re missing the point, Clark. They love you
and worry about you. I worry about you. Sometimes I wish you would just
come home one Sunday for dinner and stay but I know that can’t happen.
I’ve known you since we were kids and I know how your parents raised
you. You could never stay in Smallville knowing there were things
happening in the world you could prevent. You couldn’t live with
yourself. You could never be that selfish. But I could.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You know, there are ten million people in
Metropolis and I don’t know any of them. Sometimes I think about it and
I’m saving a city full of strangers when the people I know and love are
here. And the worse part is everyone there thinks they know me.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: But there things actually happen. They need
you more than we ever could. They depend on you. You’re their hero.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Am I? NASA lost contact with the Constitution
and on reentry it exploded and twelve men died. I might have been the
only man on Earth who could have saved them.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: But you didn’t, Clark. You didn’t save them
and they died. You can’t save them all.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Instead, I spent my afternoon saving the life
of a billionaire egomaniac.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: And what if you hadn’t? What if that woman
blew up the building and a few thousand people died? Clark, you can’t be
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: But if I had been-</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: If you had been what? Two places in the same
time? Stronger? Faster? You may be the most amazing person on the planet
and the world may call you Superman but inside you’re just a man. You
have to accept that.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Remember that night after graduation when you
took me out into the back field. I knew you were going off to college
but somewhere, I thought you were going to ask me to marry you.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I thought we would get married and you’d get
me out of the one cow town and I’d actually see something in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lana, I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I should have married you when I had the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: You’ll always have the chance, Clark. Whenever
you’re ready to come home, I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Gentlemen, I’ve had a hell of a day and I am
not in a very good mood so let’s make this short. Accounting?</p>
<p><strong>van hyning</strong>: We have acquired six more research
facilities in Southeast Asia. The munitions plant in Northern Europe
that has been prohibiting our use of their new patented circuit board is
no longer a problem.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Then the merger went well?</p>
<p><strong>van hyning</strong>: The details are in my report. LexAir,
LexOil, LexCom and their subsidiaries are all doing well, twenty-two
percent above the projected goals.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: That’s what I like to hear!</p>
<p><strong>van hyning</strong>: The stock divided this morning and
LexCorp took a two hundred point seven million dollar loss… the lowest
percentage loss of all the listed companies. A loss sixteen percent
higher than Maxwell Lord’s holdings.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What exactly am I standing in?</p>
<p><strong>van hyning</strong>: Company assets are at four point two
trillion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: That’s acceptable. Research?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: Construction of our new facilities in
South America and Greenland are proceeding ahead of schedule. The great
news is medical research has perfected the Leukemia vaccine prototype.
It works flawlessly.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Have they sent the conditions to the
pharmaceutical firms?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: Yes they have and they’ve all declined.
They argue the asking price is outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: If it were their kids let’s see how
outrageous it is. Very well, we keep it and it goes no where. The
Antarctica facility?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: Running totally on your new energy source
for eight months on a less than a quarter of a percent what it
previously used. The new fuel is clean, stable and most importantly
cheap. Of course, we only have limited resources.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Is it possible to replicate the chemical
structure?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: We know it isn’t from Earth but it’s
being worked on as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And the Metropolis Energy Commission?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: That news isn’t as good. There needs to
be a unanimous vote to change the city’s power source. We own ten of the
twelve commission members but the other two refuse to cooperate. They
think it’s unnecessary to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer’s money
on an untested source.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: The cloning?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: We have a cat?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You cloned a cat? How much money have I
spent on this cloning thing?</p>
<p><strong>van hyning</strong>: Two billion, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Two billion dollars and you have a cat?</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: Well, we have fifteen hundred cats.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Fifteen hundred cats? What am I supposed to
do with fifteen hundred cats? If I were in Korea I’d open a delicatessen
but I’m not. I’m in Metropolis where fifteen hundred cats are useless to
me. I want something better. Dogs, monkeys, French-speaking gorillas.
Impress me.</p>
<p><strong>hollister</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now to my Legal Department… I have a
problem, which in turn means you have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: This afternoon a man stood outside, on my
property and looked inside my building. My business. My home. I consider
this a grave invasion of my privacy. Now what are you going to do about
it?</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: Well, he’s Superman, sir. He’s not the kind of
person you issue subpoenas to. And he was acting with the cooperation of
the Police and under The Good Samaritan act of 1968 you can’t…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I what?</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: You can’t take legal action-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’m sorry, what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: Wynn, sir.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And Wynn, how long have you been employed
here?</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: Three months, sir.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And can you tell me what qualifies you to
work in my Legal Department?</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: I attended Harvard Law School on a full
scholarship and graduated in the top three percent with honors. I worked
as a public defender for three years in Gateway City with an undefeated
record. I had my own firm for two years in Keystone and decided I wanted
to work with the best and came here.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Are you familiar with my qualifications?</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Well, let me familiarize you with my
resume.</p>
<p><strong>van hyning</strong>: As of four-fifteen this afternoon, your
personal worth is one hundred and sixteen point one billion dollars…
give or take a few hundred million.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Of the other two, one is an advisor to the
President and the other spends his nights praying he can defend
WayneTECH from my corporate raiders. I understand you’re new but for
future reference, you never tell me what I can and cannot do. VAN
HYNING.</p>
<p><strong>van hyning</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Superman said something about not being able
to see through the lead-lined rooms in the radiation labs. Get an
estimate to the interior walls painted with a lead content paint. I’m
thinking… beige.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: The story on LexCorp bomb for the morning
edition.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Clark had his here before he left at
seven.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: And what ever happened to paper?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: How do you do it, Smallville?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Do what, Lois?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You know what.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m just doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: No. Getting the stories on the front page is
what I do. You’re doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Are you jealous, Lois?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: No, I am not jealous of you.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Tell you what. I have a meeting with MAYOR
Berkowicz to discuss the revamping of the transit system. Why don’t you
go instead?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Don’t do me any favors. Sam Lane didn’t raise
his daughters to take hand-outs.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No, I insist. I have a friend coming to town
and it’ll free up more of my time. He likes you better anyway. You
always get the good stuff out of him. Come on, Lois. He owes me an
interview as a favor. It’ll be an exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Okay, I’ll do it, but not because I want the
story. I’m doing it so you can spend the evening with your friend to do
whatever it is you do when you’re not here. Understood?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You’re helping me out.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Lois is one hard case.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Miss Lane hates to lose… especially to Mister
Kent.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Actually, I’d hate to be on the receiving end
of that but I think Kent actually likes it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: Everybody shut up or somebody’s gettin’ a
bullet in the head!</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Go up front and make sure the driver
doesn’t radio anybody or make any stops until I say so.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: They can still stop the car from the
central station so if we don’t stop at the 147th then they don’t know
what car we’re on.</p>
<p><strong>thug #3</strong>: We’re not slowing! They don’t know which
train we’re on! We are outta here!</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: What the hell is so damn funny?</p>
<p><strong>laughing hostage</strong>: …are gonna…</p>
<p><strong>laughing hostage</strong>: …get your ass…</p>
<p><strong>laughing hostage</strong>: …so kicked.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m guessing you’re new here.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I think this belongs to you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Superman, can I get my picture taken with
you?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We’re from out of town and it would be a
great souvenir.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I really don’t do pictures… but I’ll tell
you what…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Why don’t you take one of these and tell
all your friends you saw Superman catch it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: COOL!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Thanks, Superman.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m fine, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Is this from the bullets?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: Hey pigs, how long you think I’m gonna to stay
here before I breaks loose and kill you all?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: Hey piglet, nice piece you got there. You
wanna see what I’m packin’?</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: Do you like to play with handcuffs as much as
I do?</p>
<p><strong>officer warren</strong>: I prefer my men without jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: Not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: I’m flexible.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: Okay, who wants to be first?!</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: That would be me.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: To POLICE) Someone see if that driver is
okay.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Since I’m sure you don’t have a mother,
I’ll assume you don’t know better.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: Screw you, you frickin’-</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Apologize to the lady. I’m only going to
ask you nicely once.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: I’m sorry, Miss Police Lady Miss.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: KIDS! KIDS! Everybody stay calm. This is
going to be okay. Patrick! See if you can open the emergency door!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Mister Clifton! There’s a train coming!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the–?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Everybody be careful. The edges are sharp.
Don’t cut yourself.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Thank you, Superm-</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Don’t worry. It happens all the time.</p>
<p><strong>monorail conductor</strong>: Attention base fourteen!
Attention base fourteen! MMT six eight nine zero is runaway! Repeat: MMT
six eight nine zero is runaway!</p>
<p><strong>monorail conductor</strong>: Oh no. The switch.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: …has no official stand at this time but I’ll
have an answer for you next week. The last three questions will be Ms
Parks, Mr Kent and Mr Knox from the Globe.</p>
<p><strong>knox</strong>: With increased activities by Superman, does
this administration endorse these unsanctioned actions and if it
doesn’t, how does it plan to police them?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: The MAYOR…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #1</strong>: …I had the Szechwan Chicken and Garlic
Sauce…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #2</strong>: …how could you do that do me? You know
how much I care about you…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #3</strong>: …this behavior cannot be
tolerated…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #4</strong>: …has managed to synthesize and patent
some new mineral at LexCorp…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #5</strong>: …if you’re not doing anything after
work I was hoping you might…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #6</strong>: …are a bunch of heathen anyway…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #7</strong>: …can’t be trusted…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #8</strong>: …don’t know what I would do
without…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #9</strong>: …the nine thirty show…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #10</strong>: …because of the gun…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #11</strong>: …is so yummy…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #12</strong>: …aren’t really hers…</p>
<p><strong>eavesdrop #13</strong>: …emergency vehicles stand by for
massive collision victims at Monorail Base fourteen…</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: …but is appreciated regardless, Mr Knox. And
the last question goes to Kent.</p>
<p><strong>them apart revealing the red and yellow “s” shield on blue
that</strong>: FILLS HIS CHEST.</p>
<p><strong>monorail conductor</strong>: Come on, Superman! You can do
it!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: WHAT!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Wait till my wife hears this one.</p>
<p><strong>school girl</strong>: Then the bus flipped over and we all
fell and the train was coming but somebody pushed us out the way and he
was big and strong and big and he pushed us off the tracks.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I don’t know where he came from but he grabbed
that guy and tosses him through the window into traffic like he was
nothing. He made him apologize to Leah but I don’t know, I might have
let the guy get hit by that truck.</p>
<p><strong>monorail conductor</strong>: I’ve seen Superman in action but
he looked different today. Like he wasn’t all there.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Metallo. Who is he? What is he? Where did he
come from? In the past twenty-four hours, he’s been responsible for six
different rescues and stopping three crimes in progress. With rumors of
Superman’s abilities waning, could his timing be better?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Professor HAMILTON, how accurate are the
reports of an “injured” Superman?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Since Superman’s potential and the origin
of his abilities are unknown to us, there is no sure way to tell to what
extent he’s suffering, if he’s suffering at all.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: So you will agree Superman is not the Man Of
Tomorrow he was last month.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: I have done more tests on Superman than
anyone else has on Earth but the duration of time it took for his powers
to deteriorate to their current state, only he knows. I can only imagine
the effect having such power and then suddenly have it dissipate…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Hold on. We have a report Metallo just
stopped a jewel heist in the downtown financial district. We have a
camera there now. Let’s see if we can go live.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Folks, I’m not sure what we’re looking at
here. There appears to be some fire and property damage.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wait! There’s Metallo.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Metallo!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: This is Angela Chen with Action Comments.
Can we have a few words?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You’re abilities obviously dwarf the rest of
us. Can you tell us how you became Metallo?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: I wish I could but most of it’s a blur to
me. I remember being in a car accident and rescued by someone on the
outskirts of the city. I was almost dead and this man, a scientist,
saved my life. Unfortunately the scientist died soon after so there is a
lot that’s unexplained even to me. I’m not sure what he did to me but
I’m just glad to be alive. I feel better now than I ever have.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: The talk of the town is that if you hadn’t
assisted Superman with the monorail, hundreds could have died and
possibly Superman. Do you believe Superman is weakening?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Stopping that train wasn’t easy. I know.
Maybe there are some jobs that require more than Superman.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Is that your way of saying you plan on
replacing Metropolis’ Marvel?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Definitely not. Superman is a hero to me as
he is everyone in Metropolis, if not the world. Look, Metropolis is a
big town. There are eleven million people here and I think there is more
than enough room for the both of us. I bet the guy could use a
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Now if you don’t mind, I’d like to make
sure these guys get taken off and I still have to clean up this
mess.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Thanks for your time. We have a CALLER.
CALLER you’re on the air with Professor HAMILTON.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I seen Sooperman in action and I don’t
believe you guys is writin’ his death certificate already and puttin’
that Metallo guy on yer shoulders. The guy didn’t catch a train for
Pete’s sake! He’s always been there when it mattered. Maybe the guy
didn’t get enough sleep or he’s got some kinda twenty-five hour bug or
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh-kay. We have another CALLER with an
opposing view.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You really must develop a better screening
process.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Is this Lex Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What an unexpected pleasure. Metropolis’
favorite entrepreneur. Can I call you Lex?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: No. I agree with Metallo. There is room in
Metropolis for two heroes. I think underestimating Metallo may be a
grave mistake. To put so much trust in one person can only be dangerous.
At least we know Metallo is human unlike Superman who hides his origin.
Exactly what do we know about Superman in the few years he’s been
here.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: I know he can kick your bald ass clear to
Otisburg–</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Otisburg?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Yeah you-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Otisburg?</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Tell you what Luther…</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Lu-thor.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Dumbass! Why don’t you come out of that
fancy glass house and you and me can do a little one on one in yer front
yard or ain’t you got the rocks?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Okay, I think that will be enough and we’ll
be back after this commercial break.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Did you see Metallo on the news? Man, is he
something or what?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mister Kent sneezed.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Are you sick, Smallville?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: A little under the weather. Probably
something going around.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: In June?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’ve never seen you sick, Clark. I thought
they built all you country boys big and strong.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s true, Mister Kent. Wow. You’re quick,
Miss Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m a reporter, Jimmy. I notice things.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: HAS ANYBODY NOTICED IF METALLO IS WEARING A
WEDDING RING?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I haven’t been feeling well. I’m probably
best I go home and get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Jimmy, could you take this down to the mail
room.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure thing, Mister Kent.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Lana Lang?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: A letter? Let me guess your pigeons haven’t
come back yet? You know, with emails, faxes and if you really want to be
a Neanderthal you could always use the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: I think it’s sweet. I can’t remember when the
last time somebody wrote something for me. Why can’t I meet a nice
guy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Didn’t Bruce Wayne serve you with a
restraining order?</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: That was four years ago and I am feeling much
better now, thank you. Any good dirt I should know about, Clark?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Kent doesn’t have any dirt. He’s going to go
home and make some soup from a Kent recipe that’s been in the family for
six generations and huddle down with a quilt and Frank Capra movie that
would make me wretch. Aren’t you, Kent?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Seven generations.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I thought you had visitors tonight, Mister
Kent. Isn’t that why you’re letting Miss Lane interview Mayor
Berkowicz?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist #3</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: I’m here to see Clark Kent.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Hmmmm. More Kansas farm boys?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Cat likes ’em big. It must be all the
corn.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: KENT!</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Why are you so hard on Clark, Lois?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: She’s jealous because she’s LOIS LANE: ACE
REPORTER and the story of the century, the coming of SUPERMAN, was
swooped right out from underneath her while she was there; by the new
guy, the country guy. The nobody who went to college at Hicksville
University in Kansas. The nobody who never had a professional gig in his
life and not only does he manage to sneak a story pass the great and
powerful Lois Lane, he manages to win a Carlin Award in the process… On
his first… time… out. Green doesn’t become you, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You want to know what it is? This guy is a Boy
Scout. He doesn’t smoke. He doesn’t drink. He doesn’t swear. He calls
his parents everyday. If I had to talk to my father everyday I’d kill
myself. He’s honest. He’s trustworthy. He’s moral. Every friend he’s got
he’s had since high school and that just isn’t normal. The guy says
grace before his meals, eats his vegetables first and drinks milk. And
that ridiculous hat! Who wears a fedora? For Christ’s sake, has anyone
ever seen him use the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I saw him help old lady Hayworth across the
street to Berardo’s Delicatessen yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: That is exactly what I mean. Everybody knows
old lady Hayworth is a cranky bitch. He’s like some kind of by-the-book
moral, excellent worker, great writer, seven-year-old in the body of a
linebacker virgin.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: That’s it. You’re crazy. I hope your medical is
paid for.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: No. There is something else to this guy.
Things about him we couldn’t imagine. Nobody eats that much apple pie. I
can’t put my finger on it but you’ll know when I do. Kent is full of
surprises.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: I was told I could find Clark Kent
here.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Clark Kent. He’s a reporter.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: This is the City Room, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Diana!</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I thought I was in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Did you have any trouble getting into
town?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I’m okay. I have a pretty good sense of
direction.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Everyone, this is an old friend, Diana. This
is Ron Troupe. Cat Grant our society columnist. Jimmy Olsen our favorite
photographer. And this is Lois Lane.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Clark’s told me a lot about you, Miss
Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh really…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Let me get my things and we can go. Have a
seat.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: So Diana…?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Just… Diana.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What is it you do?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I’m an ancient history liaison for Marston
University in Boston.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Mostly Greek history and cultures.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Are you from Smallville?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Do I look like I’m from Smallville?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: It was a pleasure meeting you all.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Geez, where did Kent find the Amazon?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: This one is new.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: They’re such good people.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You know they sent me a Christmas card.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I told them you didn’t celebrate Christmas.
You should send them a card when Zeus’ birthday comes.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I don’t think Hallmark makes a card for
that.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: A little place I know outside the city.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Everyone misses you, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Really? That means a lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You seem distant. What’s troubling you,
Clark?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: That train. I’ve caught planes in midair. I
should have been able to stop that. If Metallo hadn’t been there those
people would have died.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: But they didn’t. Be glad he was there.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It’s weird because I felt fine before I got
there and then I just felt so tired.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It’s not okay. I don’t get sick. Do you have
any idea what it takes to make me tired? There was a minute where I
thought I was going to die with those people.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Have you ever thought you were going to
die?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I, I’ve never considered it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Me neither. I swear I was going to get
crushed between those trains. There was a minute, not even, a fraction
of a second, where something inside told me to get out the way.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Clark…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: And then in a split second I justified it
thinking if I saved myself and let those few hundred people die how many
more could I save in my lifetime? A few thousand? Tens of thousands?
Would letting a few hundred people die be worth saving a few million in
the end?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: But you could never do that. Do you think you
could just let some asteroid drop into the middle of downtown and
whatever happens, happens. That’s not like you. I know it’s a lot of
pressure but you raise the standard. Hal doesn’t tell anybody but I can
tell he tries to run the League like you would. People strive to be like
you and that’s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m afraid one day I’m going to fail
them.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: And one day you might. But you can’t live in
fear of that. One day we both might die but it isn’t how you die that’s
important… it’s how you lived.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It’s nice to have someone who
understands.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Anytime, Clark. Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: This is a really nice spot. I always wondered
why it’s here.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Do you really want to know?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Don’t fall asleep in there, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: He is such a bookworm.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: What the hell happened?!</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: We have a core breach in sectors seventeen,
five, sixty-six, seventy-five and forty-three.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #2</strong>: Barrier fifteen will reach maximum
potential in three minutes. Reserve shields are in place.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #3</strong>: It’s Damage Control. They want to
know can you contain it?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: Sound ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: –has ruptured and reached threatening levels
in the Suicide Slum borough of Metropolis-</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #3</strong>: Thank God, you’re here, Superman.
We’ve lost control of the fail-safes and the core is ruptured. We’ll
reach a red zone in less than ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: What do you need me to do?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: The core functions with Uranium 238
rods surrounded with water–</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: –Creating steam which powers turbines
creating the electricity. I really haven’t got time for the science
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: The containment systems and backup
systems have gone off-line.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: How old is this plant?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: It was built in 1984.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Then I assume you’re using Barium and lead
shielding to contain the radiation?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: Yes. If you can manually force the
fail-safe shields back into place we can control the rupture from here.
If not, radioactive steam forces the chamber to depressurize and there
are going to be a lot of dead people in this city.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Not tonight. Yell when the shields are in
place. I’ll be listing for you.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #3</strong>: He’s doing it!</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: This is amazing! Nobody can survive
that much radiation!</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #3</strong>: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #2</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #1</strong>: Maybe the radiation got to him?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #2</strong>: No. The computer must be
malfunctioning from the heat.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor #3</strong>: That’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Thank God, Superm-</p>
<p><strong>anchor #1</strong>: … conflicting reports from around the
globe…</p>
<p><strong>anchor #2</strong>: … of a near-nuclear meltdown in

EXAGGERATED. SUPERMAN IS ALIVE!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: How did I get here?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: They took you to the hospital and broke
six needles trying to get a blood sample. They gave up and brought you
to me.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Are the people safe?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Everyone is fine. Metallo shut the reactor
down and saved you.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I have to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Superman, you’re very weak. I’d like to
run some more tests.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m sorry, Professor, but I haven’t got
time for that.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: They said you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Lana, may I stay here with you for
awhile?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Sure, Clark. Is everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I just need some time away.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I’m so glad you came.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, MAYOR Frank
Berkowicz.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: I appreciate your coming on such short
notice. I will try to make this brief. These are the facts: This
morning, there was an unidentified malfunction at the Shuster Nuclear
Facility. Attempting to stop a possible meltdown, Superman was rendered
unconscious. The state of his condition was not known then and is still
unclear. Metallo rescued Superman from the nuclear core of the facility
and possible death. For that we are all grateful. At this time I would
like to extend my personal gratitude, as well as that of the great city
of Metropolis, to Metallo, for averting disaster and saving our
friend.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I feel so… incompetent.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Maybe you should stay here… with me.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Hello. Yes, I was watching it just now.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Sure, Mrs Kent. I don’t know either. Well, you
know I will. Okay, give Mr Kent my best. Bye. Arrggghhhh! I hate lying
to your mother. I feel so guilty.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: She knows what happened. If she knows I’m
here she’s not going to want me to go back.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: So I guess this means you aren’t staying?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Welcome to a special edition of Action
Comments. I’m your host, Angela Chen. With the near-disaster that took
place several days ago, a debate has emerged regarding Metropolis’
questionable power source. Our special guest for the hour is Metropolis’
other favorite son, millionaire industrialist Lex Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Billionaire.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: A common error.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I would like to give a special thanks to
Mister Luthor who not only agreed to this interview, but also permitted
us to telecast from one of his soundstages in the LexCorp building.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I would have been happy to join you downtown
but in light of recent incidents, one can never be too careful.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It’s our pleasure, Mister Luthor. Now it’s
your opinion this whole incident could have been avoided.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Several months ago my engineers at LexCorp
developed a revolutionary energy source. This source is able to produce
the same results as a nuclear facility without the ugly side effects the
citizens of Metropolis came so close to experiencing first hand.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Without the chance of a hazardous leak?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: None whatsoever. Our energy source is
devised by splitting atomic particles and then harnessing that
energy.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Nevertheless, if you have eliminated the
radioactive side effect, then you aren’t splitting uranium or any other
radioactive element.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Then what are you splitting?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now Angela, if I had a dime for every time
someone asked me how I did something I’d be a millionaire.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: But you are a billionaire.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You catch on quick.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: This is a report from the Metropolis Energy
Commission in which they reviewed your proposal. They objected to your
not allowing the energy source to be tested by an outside safety
committee or revealing the source of the energy.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Angela, you don’t look into the face of God
and ask him how he makes air. You should just be glad it’s there. Let it
be known there were only two people on that panel that oppose me and
refused to move into the twenty first century.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Then there is an issue of price. This energy
would cost the citizens of Metropolis three times what they are
currently being charged. Do you think this is fair?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Things cost money. Power plants cost money.
Research costs money. Skilled EMPLOYEEs cost money. Your children’s
safety costs money. People will say it’s a lot of money but I can
guarantee the people at Love Canal, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl wish
they had that option. In fact, I bet there are people in Suicide Slum
tonight that would pay for that option.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: But aren’t you afraid people will look at
this as a case of the rich getting richer? Don’t you have a duty as a
human being to-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I want the best for my city, Miss Chen. I’m
a business man, let Simon Carr and Ted Kord be philanthropists and
humanitarians.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Whoa! That almost sounded like an attack on
Superman.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Let me just thank God for Metallo because
without him there would be a few hundred thousand dead people MAYOR
Berkowicz would have to account for.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Well, in an opinion poll taken this
afternoon, citizens were asked who they would depend on in a crisis and
an overwhelming eighty-two percent still said they would side with
Superman. I think it may be a little premat–</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: WHAT THE HELL?!</p>
<p><strong>bimbo #1</strong>: Oh John, what did you have to go and do
that for? That’s the third set this week.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: I can’t stand this crap! Everywhere I go
it’s Superman save me and Superman you’re my hero! How many people do I
have to save?! How much of this do I have to put up with?!</p>
<p><strong>bimbo #2</strong>: I don’t know what that Chen girl likes but
I think you’re so much sexier than Superman. Capes are so out this year.
Besides, everybody knows nice boys finish last, and more importantly,
are so bo-ring.</p>
<p><strong>bimbo #3</strong>: Come on, John. Let’s go in the back and we
can take your mind of things.</p>
<p><strong>bimbo #3</strong>: Doesn’t that feel good?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: It doesn’t feel like anything! I can’t feel
anything! I can’t smell anything!</p>
<p><strong>bimbo #4</strong>: Don’t go anywhere, Johnny Baby. Stay here
with us.</p>
<p><strong>bimbo #5</strong>: Security? He’s out.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: –after these messages.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And we’re off. Seventy seconds people.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Yes. How long ago? Very well. Mercy, he’s on
his way. Maneuver six.</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>security #1</strong>: Sir, I’m going to have to ask-</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Is that the best Luthor’s got?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: You gotta be shittin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Mercy, is our guest under control?</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Good. Prepare him for company. I’ll be up in
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: John Corben. I have to say I thought our
working relationship up to this point had been quite complimentary. You
really must learn how to behave when you’re a guest in someone’s
home.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: What have you done to me, Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: The same thing I do to everyone. I control
you. Of course with you, it isn’t something as easy as slush funds or
threatening your family. You’re special. I had to have equipment built,
satellites to monitor you etcetera etcetera etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You didn’t think I was going to spend a few
billion dollars to make you the most powerful THUG on Earth just to
watch you walk away when you got bored, did you? It’s all planning, my
boy. That’s why I am who I am and you are… Well, why you’re stuck in
that ridiculous chair.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Nobody treats John Corben like a chump.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Pay attention you idiot, I am treating you
like a chump because, I don’t know if you noticed or not, you are the
chump. Without me, you’re nothing.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Without you, I’d still be man! I can’t feel
anything! The heat, the cold, nothing! I can’t smell! I can’t taste!
Everything sounds funny. Nothing looks right. I can’t stand this! You’ve
made me into some kind of freak!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I saved your life! If I hadn’t invested in
you, you would be a two-bit dead assassin and petty thief.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: This isn’t over, Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Is that a threat?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Why don’t you call one of your lawyers and
have them figure it out?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Better yet, why don’t I call my technicians
and have them take you apart one piece at a time? Bitch bitch bitch.
Moan moan moan. You’re alive and as jarring as it may be, it still beats
the hell out of the alternative… …Which is still an option.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: John Corben, you are alive because I want
you that way and when or if I decide otherwise, there is nothing on this
planet than can save you. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Excellent. Now I’ll let you go if you
promise to behave and cooperate as agreed.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now if you’ll excuse me, I have business to
attend to.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And John, you may be a shell of your former
self and you may be my pawn… …but at least you have your health.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: Sir, this area is authorized personnel
only. You’re Metallo.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: I didn’t know you were in the building.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: I’m a guest of Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: Well it sure is pleasure to meet you, sir.
I saw what you did with the chemical fire on the East Side. My brother
lives there and it’s appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: No problem. I was bored so I’ve been
wandering the building. I just wanted to look around. Is that okay?</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: Sure. We aren’t accustomed to having guests
but I can give you the nickel tour.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: What is all this?</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: This is the Communication Center for
LexCorp. From here we keep in contact with the affiliates in Atlanta,
New York, Tokyo, Coast City, Sydney, London and another three dozen
cities worldwide. Mister Luthor can control information from his own
private network as well as the sixty-eight satellites he has in orbit
around the planet and on reconnaissance missions through space.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Pretty impressive.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: State-of-the-art. When NASA and NORAD
upgraded they came to Mister Luthor. There isn’t another system close to
this on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: I guess all this is pretty expensive.</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Most of it is prototype. Some of it
designed by Mister Luthor himself and only he knows the specs. He’s
something of a paranoid and doesn’t like to depend on others for
designs. Most of it is irreplaceable.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Somebody call Mister Luthor!</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Mister Luthor, there’s been a problem.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What kind of problem?</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: You better just come down here.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: We did the best we could. We barricaded
the exits to contain him.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Then where is he?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM?!</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: GET OUT!</p>
<p><strong>metcalf</strong>: Clark? Is that Clark Kent?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hi, Mister Metcalf.</p>
<p><strong>mercalf</strong>: I don’t think I’ve seen you since you went
off to the big city to be reporter.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: That’s not true. You saw me last
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>metcalf</strong>: Then it just feels like forever. You know,
I bet we’re the only store in all of Kansas that gets the Daily Planet
sent in everyday. Granted, it gets here two days late but it’s the
effort that counts.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>metcalf</strong>: Where are your folks?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: They’re probably at home. They don’t know I’m
here. It’s kind of a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>metcalf</strong>: I get it. Mums the word. You take care.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: …before it’s earned our money’s all been
spent. Come on, Clark. “Put your little hand in mine.”</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Put your little hand in mine. Ain’t no hill
or mountain, we can’t climb.</p>
<p><strong>clark &amp; lana</strong>: Babe, I got you, babe. I got you,
babe.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I got you, babe.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I got you, babe.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: If you’ve got me, who’s got you?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: I got you, babe.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …don’t understand. We’re a safe distance
but that’s uncertain since Metallo has been seen to toss various debris,
some the size of cars, several blocks…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …just tuning in, Metallo, who only days
ago prevented a meltdown and saved hundreds of thousands of lives in
Metropolis’ Suicide Slum, came in this morning and ordered, repeat
ordered, it’s citizens to evacuate as he then took over the fifteen
square mile project…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …declared Suicide Slum his property and
said, and we quote, “whoever wants it can come and get it,” and then
forced its inhabitants out of their homes…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Why does it always have to be you, Clark?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Because I’m the only one who can.</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: BE CAREFUL, CLARK!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Damage report.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Metallo destroyed the majority of the
Communication nerve center. We’ve lost contact with seventy-two percent
of our affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Why wasn’t he shut down?</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: He managed to destroy enough hardware
including our links to LexSats eight, six, fifty-one, forty-seven, five,
fifteen and ninety-one including the-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: –Satellite that monitors activity in
Metropolis. He broke his leash. I need this online now.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: There’s a space shuttle preparing for launch
from a site in Corto Maltese to regrid the satellites signals to
operating stations. They should be ready in fifteen minutes. NASA has
been trying to block it as an unauthorized launch.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: NASA can go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Fifty percent of the hardware should be back
online within five hours.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: If that’s your best, your best won’t do.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Sir, we’ve already doubled our staff.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Metallo is tearing up a city block and every
COP in the state is about to take a shot at him. I’m not about to have
my investment taken out by a bunch of grunts with cheap metal badges!
Either this system is online within the hour or you answer to me!</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: We will triple our efforts, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Come on, Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t think this is a good idea, Miss
Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Front seat at the fight of the century is
always a good idea!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But nobody’s seen Superman in days.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If nobody’s seen Superman then who’s gonna
save us if something goes wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: What are you talking about? Superman doesn’t
always save us.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes, he does. Especially you.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: Sir, ground force is in place and air
support is standing by!</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Drop ’em!</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: The eye in the sky is armed and ready,
sir!</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: METALLO! You’re surrounded! Throw down your
weapons and step into the open!</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: You see any weapons?!</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Jesus, he did all that by himself?</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Surrender, Metallo! You don’t have a
chance!</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Then come and get me.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: This is your last chance! I am counting to
three! ONE! TWO!</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: INCOMING!</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: GROUND TROOPS! OPEN FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: He ain’t droppin’.</p>
<p><strong>fire trooper</strong>: CLEAR!</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Maggie we are getting our butts handed to
us!</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: ALL UNITS! EXERCISE DEADLY PHYSICAL FORCE AT
YOUR OWN DISCRETION! I REPEAT: TAKE THIS PUNK DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: JIMMY!</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Hello? Perry, you have a call.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What! Ron, I got the biggest story of the
year here. Tell my wife I’ll call her back.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: It’s not your wife.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Sawyer. What? You gotta be kiddin’ me! Dan,
we got a problem. There are civilians trapped in the area.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: These ten blocks were supposed to be
evacuated. Who the hell’s here?</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Lois Lane and some kid from The Planet.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Oh, for Pete’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: She ain’t even worth saving. She figured a
way in here, she can figure a way out.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: We have to get her.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: Captain, that thing out there has
already killed a half-dozen men and you want us to risk our lives for a
reporter who can’t follow directions?</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: If there are any snipers available, we have
civilians in the area and need a visual. She’s coming out with us.</p>
<p><strong>trooper #1</strong>: I’m not going in there.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sniper</strong>: There is a woman and a boy about three
hundred yards in from the East Side. The boy is unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: No problem. I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: It’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Rescue underway. I need as much distraction
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Lois Lane?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: No, I’m some other idiot caught in a
warzone.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Nobody likes a smart ass.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Hold this.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: It’s like a camera. Just point and
click.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Nine millimeter German Glock with a modified
grip.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I was an Army brat. I think I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Okay then, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: I know you. You’re that reporter from The
Daily Planet.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And here I didn’t think you could read.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Oh, you’re funny, too.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: How about we dance?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: My dance card’s full.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: That’s gonna cost you.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: If the lady says she doesn’t want to
dance, then she doesn’t want to dance.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You need to get to safety, Miss Lane. This
looks like a job for Superman.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: So… you finally decided to come out and
play.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Do I look like I’m playing?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Fine. It’s about time this got
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Who’s next?</p>
<p><strong>a hum that sounds like massive drilling noise erupts from
beneath</strong>: THE PAVEMENT.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Is that the best you got? It’s starting to
get to you. You can’t beat me. You’re a dead man and you don’t even know
it.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Are you sure? Yes, sir. Dan, Federal
Emergency Management wants us to get Superman out of there and evacuate
the area.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: You heard me. HAMILTON at STAR says if we
don’t get him out of there in the next five minutes he’ll be dead.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: But why are we leaving?</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: We have orders to get him and rendezvous
with HAMILTON at Swan and 143rd.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Dandy. So who’s going to go in there and get
him?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Let’s get this over with and call it a
day.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: A lot of losers have tried to kill you but
in the end I’m the only guy with the stones to do it. How does it feel
to be The Man Of Yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It’s the President, sir.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: The President has declared Metropolis a
disaster area. We’ve been denied National Guard assistance.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: He’s sending someone else.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: It seems in a diversionary tactic, the SCU
has distracted Metallo and rescued Superman who was not faring well in
the battle after a Metallo emitted a beam from- –We have instructions we
must evacuate the area. We will have reports for you as soon as
information is available.</p>
<p><strong>person #1</strong>: The big one is just as strong as
Superman.</p>
<p><strong>person #2</strong>: Man, I wonder what they’re gonna do
next?</p>
<p><strong>apache pilot #1</strong>: I been wantin’ to do this since I
was ten!</p>
<p><strong>apache pilot #2</strong>: Five by five, we are in the
pipe.</p>
<p><strong>apache pilot #3</strong>: This is Romeo Sierra Foxtrot. We
have a targeted course of three seven nine one mark eleven twelve.
Target is live. Exercise is hostile. ETA six minutes. We have been
authorized to use unnecessary physical force.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: LexSats fifty-one, forty-seven, five and
ninety-one are online including the Metropolis unit.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: And the Metallo system?</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: We’re working on it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Mister Luthor, systems have picked up three
Apache heliCOPters converging on Metallo.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: ETA?</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Six minutes.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Do we have a combat ready LexFlight Unit on
the premises?</p>
<p><strong>mercy</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Scramble the unit and have them in the drop
zone in three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>control</strong>: This is control. LexFlight Unit you have
clearance for takeoff.</p>
<p><strong>lexflight #1</strong>: Roger that. It’s a go.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: HAMILTON! There are people in danger-</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: STAR Labs has satellites that monitor
environmental anomalies. There have been surges of radiation exceeding
acceptable levels in various locales in the metropolitan area within the
last few weeks. None lasts longer than fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Are you following this, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: I was lost after “STAR Labs has
satellites.”</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: There is nothing radioactive in these
areas.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: You mean, “there should be nothing
radioactive in these areas.” But there is. Every area on irradiated area
on this map was a location where Metallo has made an appearance. Metallo
isn’t human. I’m assuming he’s a machine with a human brain and enough
natural elements to keep it functioning. Everything else is machine
powered by nuclear radiation, which could be why he’s chose Suicide Slum
to make his stand.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: The Metropolis Nuclear plant is the biggest
in the northeast.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Normally, I doubt he would have been able
to challenge Superman but since he’s using radiation from Kryptonite as
his source, Superman doesn’t stand a chance.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Krypto-what?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: It’s a mineral with radioactive properties
that siphon Superman’s abilities. Eventually his nervous system will
seize and shut down his involuntary functions one at a time in rapid
succession.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: In English, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Metallo has a radioactive rock that kills
Superman.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: Then why didn’t he just say so.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m assuming you have a plan?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Flips the latches on the box and opens it
but the contents cannot be seen) I designed this suit for when Superman
assists in deep space research. Since it’s my theory that his powers are
derived from our sun on a solar level, the suit is designed to keep his
acquired energy in and foreign energy out. The suit is destructible. If
Metallo manages to get close enough to get you out of it he can kill
you. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>lexflight one</strong>: Metallo! You are surrounded-</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>lexflight one</strong>: Surrender now and we will leave
without incident. This is your last chance, Metallo.</p>
<p><strong>lexflight one</strong>: Open fire.</p>
<p><strong>apache pilot</strong>: METALLO! THROW DOWN YOUR WEA-</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>apache pilot #2</strong>: JESUS CHRIST! He just took Scala
and Wahl out!</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Anybody else want a piece of me? Come get
some.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: If you insist.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Come out from behind the car, Metallo!</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Give me one good reason!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Gas tank.</p>
<p><strong>metallo</strong>: Let’s try that again.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>lexgun</strong>: Warning. Energy… low.</p>
<p><strong>lexgun</strong>: Energy… depleted.</p>
<p><strong>lexgun</strong>: Charging.</p>
<p><strong>lexgun</strong>: Charge complete. Energy levels at
maximum.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Timing is everything.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I murdered him.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: He was gonna do you in.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: He’s still alive. I’m detecting brain
waves. His mechanical body isn’t functioning but his brain is operating.
You didn’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>turpin</strong>: You hear that? You broke him.</p>
<p><strong>sawyer</strong>: Superman, the MAYOR wants to speak to
you.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Sir, I’m sorry there are no-</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’m sorry your Honor, Mister Luthor
isn’t-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I believe the girl outside said I wasn’t
in.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: You’ve gone too far this time, Lex. There
are six dead pilots and I don’t even know how many other wounded because
of you.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Well Frank, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: Tell their families you’re sorry! Those
men wouldn’t be dead if your incompetent men didn’t hand Metallo those
weapons!</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What can I say? I underestimated my
enemy.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: Mark my words, Lex: You are not going to
get away with this. I swear you’ll see justice or-</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Or what? What, Frank? You’re going to shut
me down? Sue me? Send me to jail. Can’t you see I’m not playing a game
here? I picked up the ball when you and your boys dropped it and I did
what needed to be done! Who was going to save us, Frank? Your toy
soldiers? The military? You see what he did to them. Where was your
precious Superman? He had abandoned you, Frank? Ask him where he was. I
did what I had to to protect what was in my best interest and that is to
make sure this city is under control and guarantee I’m the man behind
those controls. So I made a bad call. It happens.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: This isn’t your city, Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What?! I am worth one hundred and sixteen
billion dollars! I buy and sell people and their ideals the way most
people order lunch! Governors, attorneys, police and MAYORs! Everyone in
this city works for me directly or indirectly whether they know it or
not! This city is Metropolis because I made it Metropolis. Without me
it’s nothing! Just another decaying urban wasteland and you know it! You
even think about crossing me I’ll have my lawyers wrap you in red tape
from here to Kingdom Come! You remember this: You aren’t the first MAYOR
this city has ever had and God knows you aren’t the first idealist.
There will be another election in November and you might be sitting in
your quaint little office in City Hall and you might not be. I, however,
know exactly where I’ll be sitting.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Now gentlemen, if you’ll excuse me, I have
an empire to run.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: Superman…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Yes, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: Under the power granted to me by the city
of Metropolis I am deputizing you. Arrest this man.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Look up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Turn to the left.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’d invite you in for a drink but you don’t
seem like the drinking type… even though a stiff drink would probably do
you some good.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You’re a pretty smart fellow so you probably
know your recent failings were no fault of your own. It’s really simple:
For enough money you can get anyone to sabotage a monorail or school bus
and push it on some train tracks.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m watching you, Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Miss Teshmacher.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Tell the boys in R and D it works. They’ll
see my appreciation for the efforts in next week’s check.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Right away, Mister Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: This morning, sources at Interpol and the
Central Intelligence Agency have confirmed internet speculation that
Metallo’s true identity is that of John Corben, a known mercenary and
thief wanted worldwide for crimes neither agency would elaborate on. How
the human Corben became the superhuman Metallo, is still a mystery.
MAYOR Berkowicz has this to say:</p>
<p><strong>berkowicz</strong>: It has been a difficult few days for us
all. The loss of life cannot be replaced. We have suffered many
tragedies and avoided more but today we are safe. Wherever you are,
thank you Superman.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: This is Angela Chen. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You never get tired of this do you?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’m glad your home, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Of course, Ma. It’s Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>camera pans out ending on their silhouettes and the sunset
and</strong>: THEN A SLOW FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: My time is valuable, Doctor Weng.</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: Then I will not abuse it. I thought you’d be
interested in our progress.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: I’m always interested in progress.</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: Since the Metallo body was a prototype, we
were able to salvage the main processors and reflex circuitry. The brain
still functions well… surprisingly.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Keep the equipment. That costs money. You
can toss the brain. I’ll find another one. And the Police…?</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: Will have the useless replica we designed to
replace this one and will be none the wiser. It still puzzles me how you
managed to retrieve this one from a secured Police facility.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Gotham has some of the best thieves in the
world if you can find them. Pay them enough money and they can get you
anything.</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: We have also made great strides with the
cloning.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: What have you got.</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: The last was orangutan. Fully mobile and
intelligent. She lived for three days. Seventeen hours longer than the
previous one. It was quite marvelous.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: You do fantastic work, Weng.</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: I am glad you’re satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: Weng…</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: Yes, Mister Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>luthor</strong>: On second thought, keep the brain. I’ll find
some use for it.</p>
<p><strong>weng</strong>: Of course, Mister Luthor.</p>
