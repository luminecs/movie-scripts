<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: It’s hard for us here to believe what
we’re reporting to you, but it does seem to be a fact.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Bodies of the recently dead are
returning to life and attacking the living.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Murder victims have shown signs of
having been partially devoured by their murderers.</p>
<p><strong>second newscaster</strong>: Because of the obvious threat
to</p>
<p><strong>second newscaster</strong>: It has been established that
persons who have recently died have been returning to life and eating
the flesh of the living.</p>
<p><strong>second newscaster</strong>: We must not be lulled by the
concept that these are our family members or our friends. They are not.
They must be destroyed on sight.</p>
<p><strong>third newscaster</strong>: Every dead body that is not
exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills. The people it
kills get up and kill. They kill for one reason. They kill for food.</p>
<p><strong>third newscaster</strong>: If this situation is allowed to
continue, there will be nothing left. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>click! in absolute black, a single word fades up: “today”.
a</strong>: SOUND FADES IN TOO. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK! Soft.
Metallic. It makes us nervous.</p>
<p><strong>in color</strong>: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect
American town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops
whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES, SOLID
VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the “BEST EATS IN TOWN”. But
something is wrong. The neon isn’t lit. Nothing in town is lit. Street
lamps, windows, are all dark. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING
SOUND continues.</p>
<p><strong>a closer inspection reveals</strong>: The “MUSICIANS” are
DEAD. So are the “PEDESTRIANS”. Flesh is rotting off their bones. The
town itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They’re trying to be us.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: They used to be us.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: They’re learning how to be us again.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: o way. Some germ or some devil got them things
up and walkin’. But there’s a big difference between them and us.
They’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Isn’t that what we’re doing, son? Pretending
to be alive?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>guerilla</strong>: Whole lotta trash this week.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: That’s life, brother. A whole lotta
trash.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: from the town below.</p>
<p><strong>through the binoculars</strong>: BIG DADDY replaces the
nozzle in the gas pump. Sensing something, it looks around. Up. His dead
eyes lock on Riley’s. Big Daddy grunts. Responding to him…</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: You any good with those?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Dunno. It’s my first trip. Never had to use
`em before.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Great. I’m out here with a guy who can’t
shoot. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: Jesus. You can’t shoot, neither!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tcha doin’, Riley?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Havin’ a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I have bad dreams. Hell, yes. Just look at
me, you can tell that I have terrible dreams.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: The town is full of walkers.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Every town is full of walkers.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: These aren’t just walking. They’re
like…regular folks.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: But they’re dumb, Riley. Hell, dead folks
is near as dumb as me!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: You learned how to make yourself useful.
That’s what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: They dumped the trash. Cholo’s on his
way.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>pretty boy</strong>: I kept his jacket. For good luck.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Luck?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Put some flowers in the graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>:
<code>Flowers in the graveyard'. Why do you call</code>em that, Riley? I
don’t get it. These here flowers ain’t the kind you lay down on the
ground. These here are sky flowers. Way up in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: I love ya, Charlie. Know why? Cuzz you still
believe in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>holo</strong>: You guys scope out the town?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Looks like nobody’s hit it before.</p>
<p><strong>holo</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Always ready. Just look at me ou can tell
I’m always ready.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: I look at you, all I see’s an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t think that’s all you see.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Let’s go have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Ain’t about fun, Cholo.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: We go in, do our job, and get out, all of us
alive, okay? I don’t want any fuck-ups on my last day out here.</p>
<p><strong>holo</strong>: My last day, too.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’d he do, hit the lottery or
somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Somethin’. Somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Do those things really work?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Yup. Stenches can’t take their eyes off
`em.</p>
<p><strong>through the windshield</strong>: RILEY recognizes BIG DADDY
from the gas station. He also recognizes the Thing’s anguish as…</p>
<p><strong>through the windshield</strong>: RILEY and MIKE watch the
T-BIRD ROAR down MAIN STREET. The FOUR GUERILLAS inside laugh gleefully
as they use the MACHINE GUNS to MOW DOWN HAPLESS ZOMBIES.</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: I thought it was gonna be a battle. This is a
fucking massacre.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Hey, not me, Boss. You told me not to have
any fun, I’m not having any fun at all. Come with me, kid. I’ll show you
the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: To get supplies. Essential supplies. That’s
job our job, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: How’s the food?</p>
<p><strong>guerilla #1</strong>: Lousy, but there’s lots of it.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Number Two, what’s your location?</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: rug store. Need an aspirin? I got a million of
`em.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Antibiotics. We need antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>guerilla #2</strong>: We’re set.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Number Three?</p>
<p><strong>guerilla #3</strong>: Guns and ammo, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Harry, jump on!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nothin’ in there but booze. Booze ain’t
essential.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: A jug of good Kentucky goes for fifteen
hundred back in town.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I’m not risking anybody’s ass just so you can
pick up some side money.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Not askin’ you to.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: Mike! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Nice shootin’.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Good shootin’. Ain’t no such thing as nice
shootin’.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Close one.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: I’m still here, ain’t I?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Shit! Look out, kid!</p>
<p><strong>holo</strong>: Fuckin’ rookies.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: It’s alright, son. You’re gonna be
alright.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No. I’m dead. You get bit by one f those
things and you become what they are.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: here’s a RIPPING SOUND as the Father’s NECK is
PULLED APART by the weight of its limp body. The body DROPS to the
street.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle:</strong>: With the city in the distance, Big
Daddy starts walking. NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him. Soon there
are MORE. None of them knows where they are going. Or why. All that
seems to matter is that they have a leader.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Harry?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Shit happens, Riley.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Only if you let it.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Protected on three sides by mighty
rivers, the city stands as a monument</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Luxury living in the grand old style.
Dine at one of three restaurants. Look for that perfect gift in our
fabulous shopping mall.</p>
<p><strong>guerilla</strong>: They make it sound nice.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: It is nice.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: f</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Cholo.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Two people dead. That kid, Mike. He should be
here with us right now.</p>
<p><strong>holo</strong>: I didn’t kill him. He got bit and he killed
himself. Same thing I woulda done. And you!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: The fuck are you turning into, man?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: e take money to do nasty shit. Shit that
nobody else is dumb enough to do. We go in knowing the risks. The kid
did too. His number came up, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: We take the risk to bring in things people
need. Not to make a few extra bucks selling liquor. You used to know
that.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Everybody makes their own way. verybody makes
their own ucking way!</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: y daddy…he picked fruit, penny- a-piece. He
never went for anything, so he never had anything. I’m gonna have a
place, Riley. My own place! And now I got enough money to buy my way
in.</p>
<p><strong>nnouncer</strong>: Isn’t it time? Isn’t it your time? For
Fiddler’s Green.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: You’re dreaming, Cholo. They’d never let me
in. They’ll never let you in. We’re the wrong kind.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Bask in the security of a city protected
not only by its natural boundaries, but by hand-picked members of its
own private militia.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: CORPSES hang all along the stretch, suspended on
the barbs.</p>
<p><strong>ilitary woman</strong>: Stench! Ten o-clock!</p>
<p><strong>military man</strong>: Take its fuckin’ face off.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: DeMora. Supply unit</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: What’s in them boxes?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Essential supplies. For the man upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Nope. When I said quittin’ time, I meant
quittin’</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wanna get a drink, Riley? Just ook at me,
you can tell I could use a drink.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Later. Gotta see a man about a car.</p>
<p><strong>mulligan</strong>: How long are you gonna let him push you
around? If there was enough of us…if you all would join up with us…we
could pull him down off his throne!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: You can’t fix a place like this, Mulligan.
You just have to get out</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Everyone’s stoppable.</p>
<p><strong>mulligan</strong>: You alright, son?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m fine, dad.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Antibiotics. For your boy.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Where’s the car?</p>
<p><strong>obo</strong>: What car?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: My new car. I paid for it. I was here
yesterday. There were two guys getting it ready for me.</p>
<p><strong>obo</strong>: There was nobody here this morning.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What happened, Riley. Didja get fucked?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>35 b 35</strong>: ING! An elevator door opens. CHOLO,
carrying the champagne and Cohibas, steps out, walks to “PENTHOUSE
NUMBER ONE”, and rings the bell. An instant after he pushes the button…
…the door is JERKED OPEN by TYLER KNIPP, 50-something, an African
American man in a white butler’s jacket. Frightened, he’s wielding a
SCISSORS, poised to strike.</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: Oh, Mister DeMora. Mister Kaufman ain’t home
and there’s some shit goin’ down. No lie. I heard…</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: I heard that!</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: Oh, man. Mister K. sure gonna be upset about
this.</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: I called Security. They should be here…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My Johnny, he killed himself, he killed
himself. My Johnny! My Johnny!</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Keep it together, lady.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Dad. Oh, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Se-Security. Are you Security?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: No, I…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Then, for God’s sake, who ARE YOU?!</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Shut up! I gotta hear. Where’d he go? Where’d
the other guy go?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Hey, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: No problem, no problem! But there is a
problem. There’s a dead guy</p>
<p><strong>alone here!</strong>: She fumbles with the weapon, not
knowing how to make it work.</p>
<p><strong>bitten security guard</strong>: I need help. I need help!</p>
<p><strong>surviving security guard</strong>: You…FUCK!</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: You wanna talk about this? I did what I had
to do. I only did what I had to do!</p>
<p><strong>tout</strong>: Supply run last night, uh? Bet you have some
money in your pocket. I can show you how to turn that money into more
money.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Roach. Where’s Chihuahua?</p>
<p><strong>hihuahua</strong>: Put me down! Put me down!</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: What happened to my fucking car?</p>
<p><strong>chihuahua</strong>: What? They’re fixing it up.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I went over to the garage. Your guys aren’t
there. The car’s not there. My dinero’s not there.</p>
<p><strong>chihuahua</strong>: Hey, this is not me. I did not do this to
you. I am your friend. Put me down. Come on. I find out what went
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Just get me the car, or they’ll carry you out
of here inside that fucking hat.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: EAD RED, alarmed by the color of DEAD BLACK’s
face, reaches out and gently touches the paint. Its fingers come away
with blackened tips.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What are they betting on, Riley?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Red or Black. Who’s gonna win the fight.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What fight? Stenches don’t fight.</p>
<p><strong>tout</strong>: They do when there’s food.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: What’s on the menu today? Cat or dog?</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: lack backs up, hits the wall of the cage and,
terrified, starts to circle its iron perimeter. The Dead Men flank her.
Black is the first to touch her. The crowd HOWLS.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Give us our guns.</p>
<p><strong>bruiser</strong>: You leavin’?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: In a little while.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: No guns in here!</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>chihuahua</strong>: My suit! You fucked up my new suit!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: I’m alright, I’M ALRIGHT!</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: ucker got my right arm. I’m a lefty.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Seen you around.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Seen you around.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: The hell happened here?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Somebody shot the little fat man.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yeah, I see that. You’re under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>ilhouetted man</strong>: How was Uniontown?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: ou probably want a glass, don’t you? Sure, a
high-toned man likes to drink out of a glass.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: I got something else, too.</p>
<p><strong>silhouetted man</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: No, thank you! Twenty grand. That’s what I
got comin’ for last night. I never bothered to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>ilhouetted man</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Nope. I left it in the bank. Your bank. With
all my other dough. rom all those other nights. I got enough now to buy
me a place.</p>
<p><strong>silhouetted man</strong>: You mean here? In the Green?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’m sorry, Mister DeMora, but there’s a
very long waiting list.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: This is an extremely desirable location.
Space is limited.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: You mean restricted.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, I do have a board of directors, a
membership committee that has to approve…</p>
<p><strong>holo</strong>: I guess it takes more than money to become a
“member”.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from
the bank and spend them somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Don’t do this to me. Don’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>aufman</strong>: I’m sorry, but…</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: No, no, no. Three years! Three years I been
cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I’m not
good enough? You’re the one who’s no good. You are no fucking good. And
you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on
around here. How many of your fucking “members” know what’s in that
garbage I take out for you?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Maybe we should talk about this when you’re
less excited.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I won’t be needing this man any more.</p>
<p><strong>42 t 42</strong>: HE SECURITY GUARDS lead CHOLO down the
stairs. Cholo WHIRLS like a Ninja. He SLUGS one guard, kicks another in
the groin, the third in the face, and escapes through a fire door.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Why you? In that arena. Why did the little
fat man throw you in with those things?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: It wasn’t the little man. It was the big man.
The man upstairs. He’s got his fingers in everything down here. If you
can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him.
He’s just seein’ that we get a few cheap kicks so we don’t go thinkin’
too hard about why he’s eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get
the bones.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Same question. Why you?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: They found out I was working with Mulligan
and his people. Tired of eatin’ off Cbones.</p>
<p><strong>harlie</strong>: What can you do? Every place is the
same.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Places with people. I’m gonna find me a place
where there ain’t no people. North. Canada.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Wherever you’re going, take me ith you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He won’t. Riley likes to be alone. He might
take me. Cuzz havin’ me around is pretty much the same as bein’ alone.
an shoot.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: I can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking
useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till
somebody figured I’d be a better hooker than a soldier.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I don’t need to hear your story. Everybody’s
got a story, and I’m tired of hearin’ them all!</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: What’s your story, Riley?</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: I said everybody has a story. That was wrong.
I don’t have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School.
Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me… …till everything
changed.</p>
<p><strong>lack</strong>: Everything changed for all of us. Whether we
had a story or not.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Mulligan.</p>
<p><strong>harlie</strong>: What are they gonna do? Kill him?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Not right away. First, they’ll try to get
what they can out of him. About people like me.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: We’re taking the truck out. Get he guys.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: Riley?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: No, not him. Just the regular uys. Know what
I mean?</p>
<p><strong>arrett</strong>: You win. You got him in the brain.</p>
<p><strong>depot guard</strong>: What’s up, Cholo?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Takin’ the truck out.</p>
<p><strong>depot guard</strong>: You just got back in this morning.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Nobody gets a day off these days.</p>
<p><strong>depot guard</strong>: Hey, wait a minute this is from
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Oh, I must have given you the wrong one.
Here…</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>depot guard</strong>: Relax. Just target practise.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Double or nothing?</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Quit scratching around back there. You’re
tryin’ ta fuck up my aim.</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: I’m just standin’ here. I’m not doin’
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: here’s nothing there. Nothing but BRANCHES being
slapped by erratic gusts of wind.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: What’s that? Screaming practice?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Ain’t our fight. Stenches are making it easy
for us.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: Let’s grab the truck.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: Should we send up some `sky flowers’?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: No. Those things want to get in here…let `em
in.</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: Phone call, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Thank you, Knipp. I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: aufman?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Ah. The one that got away.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: You said we should talk when I was less
excited. I’m a lot less excited now.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What do you want, Mister DeMora?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: I can’t have a place in the Green, fine. I’ll
go find another place. But you know what I’m gonna need? Money. I want
my money out of your bank. And I want the rest of the money out of your
bank. And if you don’t give it to me, I’m gonna blow you out of your
fuckin’ ivory tower. I’ve got Dead Reckoning.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That’s unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Put the money on a boat and send it across
the river to the South Side. Tenth Street Pier. One man to drive the
boat, no more. You’ve got till midnight. Four hours. I won’t be there.
Dead Reckoning won’t be there. But I’ll know if it happens. I’ll know if
it doesn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>utherland</strong>: Trouble?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: In a world where the dead are returning to
life, the word `trouble’ loses much of its meaning. He wants money.</p>
<p><strong>sutherland</strong>: Pay him.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: We don’t negotiate with terrorists. There
are other options.</p>
<p><strong>ecurity guard</strong>: Which one of you is Denbo?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Mister Denbo. Come in. Can I offer you a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Well, then…please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Nobody else is sitting. I think I’ll just
stand here, like the rest of you. While you tell me why I’m standing
here.</p>
<p><strong>aufman</strong>: We need you to repossess a vehicle that
belongs to us. The vehicle you designed, Mister Denbo. Dead Reckoning
has been stolen. By your second in command. I want him captured. Or
killed. And I want my two-million-dollar piece of equipment
returned.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: The truck.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Which has guns. Big guns. That could do a
great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Why don’t you just send out your troops?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t want to lose them. I could send
five hundred men against that thing and they’d all come back in body
bags. It’s your vehicle. Cholo was your man. You might be able to get
close enough to…do what has to be done. Do this for me and I’ll grant
you something in return. Residence in the Green.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Not me. That’s what Cholo wanted, and you
didn’t give it to him, did you? That’s why he’s out there waving a
cannon at your ass.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Give me one of those vehicles, over</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: But…there’s nothing up north.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: That’s the idea.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Alright. You’ve named your price. An easy
one to pay.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: One more thing. My friends. They go with
me.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Take them.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: an you find Dead Reckoning? Quickly?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: How quickly?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: By midnight.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I have a way.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I like the iron I already got.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: This piece fires fourteen rounds a
second.</p>
<p><strong>harlie</strong>: I don’t norm’ly need fourteen rounds.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: I’ll take that gun.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Can you handle it?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Better’n you. The safety’s off.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: You guys don’t have to come out with me if
you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: I’d feel like a dick if I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>harlie</strong>: Me too. Just look at me you can tell I’d
feel like a dick.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Some shit, ain’t it? Goin’ out to save a
place we don’t give a fuck</p>
<p><strong>aufman</strong>: Mister Denbo.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Your friends are going out with you. I want
some of my friends to go along, as well. anolete.</p>
<p><strong>manolete</strong>: That’s how I am called…Manolete. After the
bullfighter.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Teahouse.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: illsbury.</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: ILLSBURY is a woman, a Sumo-sized Samoan, six
hundred pounds and seven feet tall, swaggering, decked out in a clatter
of fighting gear.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: I come here to do sumthin’. Not stann
aroun’. Why we stann aroun’? Less go do sumthin’.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: At midnight. Give me a call. Let e know if
we’re rich or not.</p>
<p><strong>harlie</strong>: Geez. Cholo made a mess.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Cholo didn’t do all this.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Stenches have been at this place.</p>
<p><strong>manolete</strong>: When the truck pulled out, it must have
knocked the fence down. That’s how they got in.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: That fencing was pushed in from outside.</p>
<p><strong>teahouse</strong>: You know how many stenches it would take
to do that?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: There’s a thousand of them out there for
every one of us.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Good thing we’re smarter.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Look who’s talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: They’re getting smart. I saw it in</p>
<p><strong>teahouse</strong>: What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: They want the city.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: The city is us. They’re after us. We pissed
`em off one too many times.</p>
<p><strong>manolete</strong>: They’ll never get across the river.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thank Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Gotta love the guy. He still believes in
Heaven. Anyone got a radio?</p>
<p><strong>lack</strong>: Why do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Catches the light. Right now it’s
moonlight. Lets me see where I’m aimin’.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: The hell you shooting at?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That thing.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone
can react, it</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: ff-center. But I got him.</p>
<p><strong>anolete</strong>: There’s more of

<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: If they is more, we gonna need o guns.
Pull `em out n’stann up wid us, like de man you ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Riley Denbo. Calling the Green.</p>
<p><strong>63 c 63</strong>: LOSE ON: SUTHERLAND’S alarmed face.</p>
<p><strong>sutherland</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Wiped out! That’s what he said! Denbo! He
said the depot was wiped out by stenches!</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Thank you. Keep us informed.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Gotta go get the keys, Riley.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Ain’t no keys to get. Melted.</p>
<p><strong>anolete</strong>: Screw keys. Hot wire the fucker.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e feelin’ better since I hit `im.</p>
<p><strong>lack</strong>: Thanks, Charlie. That was useful.</p>
<p><strong>manolete</strong>: I can’t see!</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Even-Steven.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not! That hurt! I didn’t hurt you!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Yellow to red!</p>
<p><strong>teahouse</strong>: What the fuck does a Samoan know about
hot-wiring cars?</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Five thousand cars. Stole. Every year in
Samoa.</p>
<p><strong>manolete</strong>: Fifty thousand in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Mexico got a million cars. Samoa got five
thousand. Every one. Stolen.</p>
<p><strong>teahouse</strong>: God! Oh, GOD, WHAT’S THIS?!</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: SHOOTS it.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: How long does he have?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I had a brother. Real brother, by birth. Bit.
Hung on for six days. Before he turned. I was the one had to shoot
him.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: And you said nothin’ bad ever happened to
you.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: That happened to my brother.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: But you kept going.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: Got to, right?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: up. Dead is dead. And that ain’t you. And
that ain’t me.</p>
<p><strong>lack</strong>: orry, man. I truly am.</p>
<p><strong>aufman</strong>: I recognize that some of you are concerned.
We’ve been threatened by a disgruntled employee. I’ve sent people out to
take care of the problem. However, should something go wrong, I want to
assure you that measures have been taken. I’ve established outposts.
With food and supplies to support us on our way.</p>
<p><strong>liff</strong>: On our way? To where?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Alternate sites have been chosen. Air
transport has been arranged. For us and our families. As well as
necessary support personnel.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: What about all the others?</p>
<p><strong>aufman</strong>: All the others can be replaced. y
others.</p>
<p><strong>liff</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Cliff, let me talk to you for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>on the other side of the doors</strong>: Kaufman leans close
to Cliff, smiling, his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: You interrupted me. I was just talking
about how people can be replaced. You don’t want to be replaced, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No, and I don’t want to replace you. You
have promise. A day may come when you earn yourself some
responsibilities. Right now, the responsibilities are mine. All the
responsibilities. It was my</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No buts.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Take him out with the rest of the garbage.
I won’t be needing this man anymore.</p>
<p><strong>utherland</strong>: Pretty soon it’s going to be one of
us.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: If I don’t have this truck, I’m no different
to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: He knows it’s his ass if he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A SOLID WALL OF WOOD. BIG DADDY, NUMBER
NINE, and OTHERS OF THE DEAD push against it. The wood holds.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: from the other side of the wall as
the wood splinters to reveal BIG DADDY’S EYES staring through at… …the
FIDDLER’S GREEN HIGH-RISE, looming closer than it was before, though
it’s still across the river.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: a small, electronic unit, the size and
appearance of a “Game Boy”. AN LED SCREEN shows a BLINKING RED DOT
moving along a MAP.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Turn left up here.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: How long since you been out here?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Never been out. Lived in the city since…it
was a regular city.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: You said you were going to make yourself
useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I’m
gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I’m gonna do it, I
don’t want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning… Sorry. That’s
where I stop. I didn’t ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car.
I’ve got the guns. I’ve got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I’m
gonna have the best fucking car that’s ever been built, and I’m taking
it to Canada. If any of you don’t like that idea…</p>
<p><strong>manolete</strong>: Some choice.</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: ood choice. I like see Canada.</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: Charlie, keep these two covered.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: This is what you were thinking about all
along. You got me out here figuring I’m a boy scout, and now you’re
telling me we’re just</p>
<p><strong>iley</strong>: You have a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>harlie</strong>: I like the way he thinks, too. Just look at
me you can tell I like the way he thinks.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Take another right.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: How do you know which way you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I built a homing device into Dead Reckoning.
If Cholo’s anywhere within fifty miles, we can track him.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Mouse. Anything?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Shit. He’s going to Ross Park.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: What’s there?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Powder magazine. Where they keep the big
boomers. Rockets. For Dead Reckoning’s cannons.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: BIG DADDY. Only the river now flows
between he and his goal: FIDDLER’S GREEN HIGH-RISE, so near and yet so
far.</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: Any word from Mister Denbo, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No. Pack us up. We might have to be
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: In the helicopters?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: We’ll only need one of them.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: Looks like no one’s here.</p>
<p><strong>scar</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>sutherland</strong>: How much is Kaufman paying you and your
men?</p>
<p><strong>scar</strong>: This place is important. The men here wouldn’t
just walk out.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: Maybe they had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: There could be stenches in there. Got a
flashlight?</p>
<p><strong>scar</strong>: Brubaker! You okay? Where’s the other guys?
What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: That’s good. That’s all we need.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: To blow up the Green.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Cholo’s moving out. Looks like he’s heading
right for us.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: hit. Off this hillside…they can shell the
Green. Pull in! There!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: hey’ll be coming up this road.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Y’all stay here.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: You’re goin’ out there alone? You need our
guns.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Dead Reckoning’s got steel skin an inch
thick. You can’t shoot your way in. I’m hopin’ I can talk my way in.</p>
<p><strong>manolete</strong>: He’s gonna steal the truck and leave us
here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Riley’d never do that. Just look at him,
you can tell he’d never do that.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Keep an eye on the hatches. If I get in, I’ll
try to leave one open.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: I like dat man. You go help `im. I take
care of dis sissy.</p>
<p><strong>greasy man</strong>: I don’t know about this. I mean…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Everything’s cool back there.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Too late to send me back.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Put on your Sunday smile. Try to look
friendly.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I am friendly. Just look at me you can tell
I’m friendly.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Denbo. And his idiot. Stop. Gimme the
mike.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: How’d you get up here, Riley?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Truck’s got a little transmitter in her
belly. Sorry I never told you.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: You were always a smart guy, Riley. Much
smarter’n me.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: You went and took off without inviting us
along.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: You weren’t around to get invited. Anyway, I
figured you wouldn’t want in on this.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: We want in on anything you got goin’.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Open up.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: What’re you, nuts?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: I’d rather have you in here than out
there.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Who’s the smart one now?</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Thought you were gonna quit. Here you are
still working for the man. Kaufman sent you out here, didn’t he? To get
the truck back.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: That man pulls the trigger, he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Who else is out there?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Kaufman sent some guys with us. We took care
of `em. I know you</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Yup. Pretty Boy, set the cannons.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Don’t do it, Cholo.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Kaufman’s got it coming.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Hit the tower square, you’ll kill a lot of
innocent people. Miss and hit the city, you’ll kill a lot of our
friends. Your beef’s with Kaufman, not them.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: He’s killed a lot of our friends. Every week
we took out the garbage, you and me. Every month I took out</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: When the smoke clears, I’m gonna</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: There won’t be any fancy shit left. And money
burns.</p>

midnight.</strong>: 4…3…2…1…CHOLO reaches down and pushes the

<p><strong>what the fuck?</strong>: CHOLO’S eyes fall to the “Game Boy”
in Riley’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: You did something, didn’t you? With your
FUCKING TOY!</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Fix it!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Not a chance.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Easy boys.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Geez. We just made it.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Riley Denbo calling the Green.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I’m glad you feel that way. Because I’m
taking your fucking truck.</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: Mister Kaufman, sir. I dunno what’s
happening, sir, but it sounds bad.</p>
<p><strong>sutherland</strong>: All this time Kaufman’s been worried
about a revolution on the streets. He never thought it would</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: No. No. They can’t leave. Not without
me!</p>
<p><strong>knipp</strong>: I think they just did, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: I hate you, Riley. There’s something about
you I’ve always fucking hated.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Riley. Look out there.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: I didn’t have to blow the fucking place up.
Somebody else did for me!</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: The stenches. They got across the river. They
got across the fucking river. Get him inside.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. What are we doin’? Where we
goin’?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Back to the city.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Not this horse. You got the T-Bird?</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: You guys’d be safer coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Nah, you’d never let me have any fun.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: T-Bird’s down that driveway over there. Guns
and ammo inside.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Almost lost you there.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: I don’t get lost so easy. We gotta get across
the water.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: We could blast our way through.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Don’t want to. If the stenches got</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: We’ve gotta come in above the throat.</p>

trap them inside. We’ve gotta give them a way out.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: KAUFMAN staring out his PENTHOUSE WINDOW,
aghast. LICKS OF FIRE reflect on the glass. SOUNDS OF WAR can be heard
from far below.</p>
<p><strong>holo</strong>: I got it.</p>

<p><strong>holo</strong>: I can’t fucking believe it. Nothin’ works out.
It’s like…the world is spinning around and we’re just…caught in the
wind. Nothin’ works out. Some damn thing always comes around the corner
and gets you.</p>
<p><strong>oxy</strong>: Your choice.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: No, don’t shoot. other half lives.</p>
<p><strong>cholo</strong>: Take the car and get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>foxy</strong>: I’ll get outa here. You take the car.</p>
<p><strong>pretty boy</strong>: The old J&amp;L’ll take us over. Right
outside the throat.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Gotta get it down.</p>
<p><strong>pretty boy</strong>: The controls are in that booth up
there.</p>
<p><strong>riley</strong>: Get back in there. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: Making myself useful.</p>
<p><strong>blam!</strong>: Riley stops running. Looks back to see what’s
being shot.</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: You missed.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nope. I blew its ass off.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just didn’t hit it in the head.</p>

<p><strong>brian</strong>: We can’t get out! There’s no way out!</p>
<p><strong>slack</strong>: There will be. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Daddy! Daddy’s still locked up.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: ome of the pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF
FIRE on the street. One of the “balls” remains whole until it smacks
against the feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker is engulfed
in flames.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hey race into the street level of the three-story
ATRIUM. Chopin LILTS, caged birds SING. RESIDENTS SCREAM, running
crazily in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: They can’t get in. Downstairs. The car.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: et back here! GET BACK HERE!</p>

<p><strong>mulligan</strong>: Let’s go get our guns, boys.</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: et outa the way, Riley!</p>

turn the wheel. Too late. RILEY DISAPPEARS!</p>
