<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Forces hostile to the United States
grow strong in the late 20th Century.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: A great moral crisis grips the
nation as social revolution and a breakdown of the criminal justice
system threaten society.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: To protect and defend its citizens,
the United States Police Force is formed.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: The population of Los Angeles grows
to 40 million. The city is ravaged by crime and immorality. A
Presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy the
city in divine retribution.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the
Richter scale hits at 12:59 p.m., August 23rd, in the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: After the devastation, the
constitution is damned, and the newly elected President accepts a
lifetime term of office.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Fearing a massive terrorist
invasion from South America, the United States prepares for war. The
Great Wall is built along the southern border, cutting off the flow of
illegal aliens.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Street gangs, South American
terrorists and the criminally insane capture Los Angeles, the once-great
City of Angels.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Now an island on the border of
civilization, L.A. is a no-man’s land of chaos, anarchy and
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: The United States Police Force,
like an army, is encamped in the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: The President’s first act as
Permanent Commander-in-Chief is Directive 17: protect and defend the
United States from this island of the damned, Hell on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose</strong>: “NEW LAS VEGAS OFF THE COAST OF SEATTLE
THURSDAY 0330:HOURS G.M.T.”</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: He’s been the Force’s Most Wanted Man
for 10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I can tell you, the
excitement around here is… Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Commander Malloy. They’re bringing him out,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: So we finally got him.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: Hold one! The door is opening!</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A.</p>
<p><strong>police voice</strong>: You are now entering the Deportation
Center. You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United
States of America.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces,
Black Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts. Youngest man ever
decorated by the President.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: You’ve been convicted of 27 moral
crimes, Plissken. The murder of an Internal Revenue agent. The
kidnapping of a bank president. Gun fighting for profit. The list goes
on and on…</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: You used to respect the law. Served
your country like no man before you. Role model to a generation.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: What happened to you, war hero? You
were the best we had.</p>
<p><strong>police voice</strong>: You are sentenced to permanent
expulsion beyond the borders of the U.S. You now have the option to
repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises. If you elect
this option, notify the Cleric Sergeant in your Processing Area.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: The whole world’s watching. Every
good and decent person who works and hard and follows the rules. What
would say to them?</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: What would you say to all of us who
believed in you, who looked up to you, who thought you stood for right
over wrong, good over evil? Be my guest. What do you have to say,
Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Call me Snake.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a
database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of
the curve.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can
pull it off - not an army, not a man.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Zero emotional developments. Total lack of
compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: How you doin’ Plissken? You like the
watch?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You assholes didn’t bring me here to give
me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What’ya want?</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Get to it.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of
government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab. The
President’s daughter, Utopia, was among them.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: To the American people - it is time to rise
up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy
of lies and terror.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We
scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Today is Day One of a brand new world. The
days of the empire are finished. To the President - my father, you know
what this is.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: You know what it will do. Unless you
abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I will use it - on you.</p>
<p><strong>congressman</strong>: Utopia, please. Give us the prototype.
If something should happen -</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: It will be in my hands - and the hands of my
lover.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man
I’ve ever known. I’m on my way to his arms.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Somehow during the tour, she came into
possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Utopia became depressed after her mother’s
suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She’d
punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a
time. Somebody else was in there with her.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian
terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
then tried to erase them. She missed this fragment on the end of her
last tape. Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank -
and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to
corrupt. Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Sad story. You got a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Shut up, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What’s the little black box do?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Top secret. Only on a need to know.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: And I don’t need to know. So fuck you, I’m
goin’ to Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That’s right, big shot. Unless you do what
we want you’re not coming back.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: So what’s the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
find the President’s daughter, secure the box, and bring ’em both out -
and I’m free?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That’s the deal.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Tell the President to adopt. I think I’ll
like L.A.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: If you bring out the prototype, you’ll
receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in
the United States. Just like in ’97. Remember New York, Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: It’s the President, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I give you my word. Put the prototype
into my hands, and you’re a free man.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I can see you’re real concerned about your
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Well, I’ll think it over.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’ve been doin’ that all my life. Might as
well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10
hours to live.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Wait a minute, what are you talkin’
about?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Having second thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Maybe. But you’re not putting any shit in
me this time.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You don’t understand. It’s already in
you.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it’s
swimming in your bloodstream. It’ll start to take effect in 9 hours.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: It’s a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system
shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty
sight.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Of course there’s an anti-toxin. Neutralizes
the virus immediately upon injection. We’ll give it to you, but you have
to do us this little favor.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Didn’t think we were that stupid, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: We’re holographs.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get this crap out of me.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working
with you, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Call me Snake.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Very sweet little weapon. Core burner.
Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds. Two 9mm handguns. Oral projectile.
Mouth dart. Hold it in your mouth for ten seconds, the coating
dissolves, it becomes a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Urolite. It’ll stun the enemy for several
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted
in her arm. You can locate her with this.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo
enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades. Blows through anything.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: L.A. is in a constant state of warfare.
Gangs fighting for the right to rule.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Heavy Third World connections. They get
weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island
from the south.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Some areas have power - they’re on line to
San Onofre.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’ll need to know more about this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Only a handful of people are aware of its
existence. Let’s just say it’s the ultimate defensive weapon.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Defense against what?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: There’s a war about to be declared, or
didn’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Third World wants to live like we do - and
they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready
to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the
border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: So what does this thing do?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: All you need to know is get it back here by
5 a.m.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You’re going over by submarine. One-man
submersible. Nuclear powered.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where do I put ashore?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the
mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up
Utopia’s tracer there. Once you go inside, you’re on your own. You know
what you have to do with the girl, don’t you? We have to spare this
nation her trial - for treason.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: So you want me to take her out? Is that an
order from the President?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Let’s just say it’s what’s best for the
country.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: By the way - who gives me the
anti-toxin?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: A medical team will be standing by.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Not you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Thought you might try that. First clip is
filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Com check.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: I’m here, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Stand by for launch. Ignitor. Fuel rod
injection.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: She’s in the green.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Lock fuel rods.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Locked.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Nuclear turbine to 75% power.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: 75% power.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Hands on switches and counting. 5…4…3…2…1.
Launch.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of
obstructions down there.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken… do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: His reactor’s starting to overheat.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken, slow down the sub. You’re
overloading the power plant.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken…?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken…?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Where’s the submarine? It’s disappeared off
our screens.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: It’s history. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Too bad about your boat, man. Supposed to
be some swells out here tonight. Big ones. You like to surf?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: You look kinda familiar. You hang out
around here much?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hey, man. I know who you are. You’re Snake
Plissken. Man, I can’t believe you’re really here.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Down that way.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Be careful. Some real strange dudes
hangin’ out there these days.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hey Snake - what’re you doin’ around here,
man? I heard they busted you up real good in Cleveland…</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin’ noise!</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Take cover, fool.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Let’s take him.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hey, what’s going down, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m looking for somebody.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Who ain’t?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Say, is it true what they say about
Cleveland, man?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can
always shift down and mojo with us anytime.</p>
<p><strong>“safe sex”, “no condoms needed”, “polypropylene
orifices”,</strong>: “SATISFACTION GUARANTEED”</p>
<p><strong>blonde hooker</strong>: It’s winnin’ time, baby. How about
you and I do some celebrating?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>blonde hooker</strong>: You must be new around here. You look
familiar. Have I done you before?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>blonde hooker</strong>: Easy, man, easy. It’s Cuervo Jones’
gang. Mescalito Justice. He’s the big boss man ’round here tonight. He’s
gonna take down the police and make ’em kiss his fine ass.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Later, Snake. We finish it later.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Snake Plissken, right?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Wow! Snake Plissken!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You’re a star in your own
right, you know that? Hey, I’m Map To The Stars Eddie. How you
doin’?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where’d they go?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Man, I’d love to have your
autograph, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I’ve been hearing about you
ever since that New York deal back in the 90’s. You’re one smooth
operator. Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death’s Head, one to
Slasher Smith…?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Who? You mean Cuervo Jones?
He’s the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President’s daughter.
Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Location.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo’s got a place near
Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I’ve been there,
y’know.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Nice little gizmo you got
there. Look, Snake. I’ve got connections in this town. You need
something, I’m your man.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey - you can’t go there,
Snake. You can’t walk through Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Specimen moving west on Sunset.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Halt! Where are you going? Are you here
for the auction?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Welcome to Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Hi, Snake. It’s so great to meet you. My
name’s Taslima. I’m a fan of yours.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: A little bit. But pretty soon I’m gonna be
dead. So are you, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I can’t believe I got caught. I run with
Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang. Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up
sometimes. I forget stuff.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I left my boyfriend’s place tonight, took a
wrong turn… Oh, Snake, I’m really kind of out of it sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: They live here, used to be like us. But
after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only
way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.
Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: No screamin’ shit.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Oh no, it’s the Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: I’ve never seen more beautiful
specimens. There will be no auction tonight. These body parts will go to
those who need them the most.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: What a beautiful blue eye. It’s a shame
you only have one.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Snake, help me.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t follow me.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: You need help.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Like hell I do.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Down this way.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: This is a dead end. You took us into a
dead end!</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I just thought you wanted to get away. I
didn’t know you wanted to go someplace.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
these buildings.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
gun!</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: How do we get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Sewers. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Down there.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Snake - what is it?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: How the hell am I supposed to know? This
is your damn city.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: What’re you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Looking to get out.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Good. I want you out. This is my
sewer.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: You’re Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Yes. Isn’t he cool?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
Pendejo Bob.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Those damn patients are coming back.
You’d better climb aboard.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: I use the eye and the music to scare em
off. They’re so whacked out, man, it works great. Chased a whole bunch
of em right off the edge there a few months ago.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: How far down does it go?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Don’t know - never do hear em land.
Earthquake opened it up.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: I own this whole place. Used to work
here in the old days. I was right in this room when the big one hit.
What a mess. We were waist high in shit. Everybody else ran, but not me.
I stayed at my post. Now it’s all mine. I brought my whole family, my
amigos, down here to live with me.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Gun runners.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Hey, it’s a living, baby.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Why don’t you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
to China, take an airplane to Brazil? Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do
you stay?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I don’t know. Somehow, I just can’t
leave.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Y’know, L.A.’s not such a bad place,
Snake. We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem -
five hours.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: All the sewers are collapsed under
Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Comes out near the Santa Monica
Freeway. Just follow the signs. Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn
left.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
You’re welcome down here anytime. Anytime at all.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The freeway’s over there. But, Snake - I
don’t think it’s such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The freeways are dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Goodbye, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Sun’s coming up in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: UV’s gonna be bad today. I have a friend
who’s got a place near here. We can crash there if you want, Snake. I’d
love to take care of you. Make you feel good.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I changed my mind. I’m going with you,
wherever you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The freeway.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I know that. There are people in some of
these cars.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: It’s where they live. I guess after
everything happened, they just needed to do what they’d always done
before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their
windows and sleep.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: What are you gonna do in Venice?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Find Cuervo Jones.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: No! Stay away, Snake. He’s mucho
muerte.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Run, Snake…They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hop in, Snake!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Snake - that was great.
They almost burned your ass off!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Too many people know where
you’re going, Snake. That’s not good. Delgado and his men were back
there waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Delgado?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo Jones’ right-hand
man. One tough hombre. You don’t understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants
to unify the island. We’re on the move, man. Big time.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Stop the damn car.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I said pull over.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: All right. Anything for you,
Snake. Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones’ place.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Right over there.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Pretty neat, huh? This is
Cuervo’s car. He lets me use it sometimes. Not to worry, Snake. You were
just shot with a fun-gun. You feel it?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Pure mesh, man. 100-proof
artery choker.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Like Cuervo says, when the
hit pulls you down to one inch from death, that is living, man.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You should’ve talked to me
first, Snake. I could’ve set this whole thing up. I’m actually Cuervo’s
agent, you know.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: And I’d love to represent
you, too. We could make a bundle together. I know I could really help
your career…I mean, you’re a legend and all - but the last couple years,
man, it’s like you’ve fallen off the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Come on, Cuervo. I delivered
him, didn’t I? All I’m asking for is what you promised.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Carrot juice? Laced with tequila,
Snake. Good for you. No? Your health.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’re coming out of it, Snake. It
hurts real bad. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Dying isn’t good enough for you. You
need pain. You’ll never make it to where you want to go without a little
pain.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
typical of American idealism. The old west, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Man against the sky. The individual.
Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much in America, Snake. You remind
them of what they used to be.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Here is the real L.A., Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: The poor. The old. The lost. People
without hope.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Do you know what they want? One word.
Liberation. They want a chance to live - before it’s all gone. They’ve
been hated for too long - Now it’s their turn.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
Actress.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: You said I could hold it.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You never heard of Snake Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: He doesn’t look like his picture. I bet he’s
fake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Now go get dressed. We have things to
do.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Are we going to eat soon? I’m starved.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Ooww!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Go on now. Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: I’m going to show her what it means to
be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life. Given her
love, Snake. Everybody needs love.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You want to hook up with us? Join the
revolution? We’re all getting out of here tomorrow night. We’re gonna
rule the world. Come with us, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: No? Too bad. Well, I told you we’d
finish it later. So guess what? It’s later.</p>
<p><strong>delgado</strong>: You’re mine now, Snake. All mine.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Shot clock!</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Welcome aboard, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: The time is now. We are the strongest.
If we go together, the others will come. We go for everything, Xi-Ping.
But we go together. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Your brother died owing me, so I’m taking
it out in trade. I need a favor…</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Sure, Snake. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I need to get across the court now…
without drawing attention to myself.</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Like you ain’t gonna stick out like a sore
thumb. But we’ll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll.
Now let’s kick some butt!</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: You play much pick-up ball, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
man.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: It’s that weird guy again.</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Snake! Shot clock!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Snake, man… Great
shot!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: That man in black. He’s very
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>xi-ping</strong>: One eye?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Yes. We gotta dump him.</p>
<p><strong>xi-ping</strong>: What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: I’m betting the cops sent him in. Man,
I do not need this. I got a war to win.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where are they going?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Oh, man… You didn’t have to
hit me, Snake. I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Bankrupt City. The Happy
Kingdom. Snake, Cuervo’s hooked up with Xi-Ping. He is primetime, man -
Mister Bad News. The rest of the city’s joining up with ’em. You’re shit
outta luck, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I could’ve helped you. We
coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you’d listen…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Lemme go…!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Kill him, kill him…!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Good thinkin’, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: My… father sent you… didn’t he? He sent you
to kill me…</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I said go!</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Don’t take it back. Don’t give it to him.
Please. Let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What does this thing do?</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: So long, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: He jumped. Down there. He’s
dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You said I could be
Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Give it.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Sure, Cuervo, but look here.
I’ve done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it
all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.</p>
<p><strong>prototype voice</strong>: I am now armed and ready for use.
Use extreme caution. The location of the effected blast area can only be
determined by the orbital position of the SatStar Ring.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: This is turning out to be my lucky
day. Get this asshole outta here.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo, wait. Please…</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Cuervo…?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’re my woman, you understand? You
don’t let anybody take you away from me without a fight.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: I tried…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless
you give your life. You fight till you’re dead. Then I forgive you.
Understand? Understand?</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Look, baby. They’re all mine.</p>
<p><strong>police voice</strong>: Full stage battle alert. All personnel
to battle stations.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: A sky full of enemy choppers on radar.
Moving over the city to the southeast.</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Commander - massive vehicle and troop
movement on the ground. All major streets leading to the southeast.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What’re they doing?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Getting ready to invade.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: So where’s Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Hey, Snake. You okay? I heard gunfire
down here… Never been down this far before… Grab this.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Now hang on.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Hey, Snake…where are you?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m in another opening… Storm drain… There
may be another way up to you…</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Snake… Snake!</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great
shot. You look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Could be a big one comin’ any minute
now…</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where’s… Cuervo Jones…?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Long gone. You’ll never catch up with him
now, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The
whole town’s gonna be there. Things changin’ fast around here, Snake.
It’s not the same as the old days, man.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Take me there…</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: You ain’t doin’ so good, Snake. You need
help. You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be
partners, but they split up.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo
Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: She’s connected with the Black Cowboys,
and they don’t take shit from nobody…</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Yo’, man. It’s a big one.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Tsunami, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Surf’s up big time.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Get ready, Snake. It’s gonna be some kinda
ride.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Let the front edge pick you up. Don’t get
on your board till it peaks.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Don’t lose it, man. You slip off your
board and it’s the Big Wipeout, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hang on, Snake! YAAAAAAA!!!!</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Listen up. I need directions. Downtown.
Somebody named Hershe.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Sure, Snake. No problem. You
gonna kill me?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I couldn’t help it, Snake. I
had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Cease fire with the bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Right. Keep goin’ straight.
Two blocks down, turn right.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours.
Have the news media standing by for my coronation. I’m arriving in
style.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: He must be bouncing the signal from one of
our communications satellites.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: That means CableNet has already picked it
up. This thing’s going live all over the country.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: It’s a brand new day comin’ up this
morning, and I’m just so proud to be leading the parade. See you soon,
putos.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: The prototype appears to be armed,
Mr. President. Shall I begin evacuation?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Does he know how to activate it?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the
button.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: What about Plissken? He could still be -</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Forget him. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That may not be true, Mr. President. He’s
one tough case. Plissken’s been dead so many times I can’t count. But he
never stays down.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait
for Plissken, or surrender. It’s your decision.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Hershe. How’re you
doin’?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hershe - it’s Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Yeah, Hershe. I brought him
to see you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: What’s in it for me?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Wait a minute. I know that voice. You’re
Carjack Malone.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: You two know each other?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You owe me. You left me holdin’ everything
back there in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hershe, you were in Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O’Shay.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: I was called away on urgent business,
Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: All right, so I made another deal.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I got a new deal for you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You help me, you live.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: I wouldn’t be doin’ that, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: We have a little arrangement. Anything
happens to me, you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: I see your point. What’s the favor?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the
Kingdom. I got one hour.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Dream on, blue eye.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Say goodnight, Carjack.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two
armies. No one gets near him.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: And he’s got the prototype.
And the girl. He holds all the cards.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Exactly what is this prototype? What does it
do?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You push the button, it
sends a signal to a ring of space defense satellites. They’re orbiting
bombs. Nukes. They explode. Huge space burst. EMP. Electromagnetic
Pulse. It happens instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP shuts down
every power source below the satellites - instantly. All electrical
devices, computers, cars, airplanes, cities. It’s the dark ages
again.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: So whoever has it runs the show.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: They were gonna use it on
South America, Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Only Cuervo’s got it now.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: And that ring of satellites
will be in position over the U.S. at 5:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: How do you know all this?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I used to represent the guy
who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: So what’s the deal, gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: We get the girl and the prototype. And we
get out.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: All of us?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Me too?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we
gonna go? What’s the payoff?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: I’d like to get out but I don’t have enough
money.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: The President’s promised to give whoever
helps me 1 million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of
them.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Uh-uh. Bluebacks.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Aw, come on, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Bluebacks. I’m not bullshittin’. I swear
to God.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: I don’t know, sounds thin to me.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones
rules the world?</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: No, that sucks. How are we getting out?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin’
things up as you go along. That’s why I cut out on you in Cleveland.
You’re just a bum like the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>mojo dellasandro</strong>: Use the air.</p>
<p><strong>mojo dellasandro</strong>: They’re burning. Santa Anas. The
night wind.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: What’re you talking about, Mojo?</p>
<p><strong>mojo dellasandro</strong>: Death from above…</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I don’t know about this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t like it, don’t come.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Where’d you get these rigs, Carjack?</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you
understand, cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I got an idea, Snake. This
looks like the prototype, right?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah, kinda.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: So maybe we can pull off a
Texas switch on Cuervo.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: If he lets you get close enough.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: The wind’s up. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: See you in hell, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: If I’m late, Carjack, don’t start without
me.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: They’re simple people. They love a
party. We’re gonna throw them one hell of a party when we get to
America. Right?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Put a smile on your face.</p>
<p><strong>bivouac</strong>: Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Are you ready for the New World?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Yeah. The place kept
changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed
’em.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Snake. We need some kind of diversion.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it!
I made it! Wait for me…</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey Cuervo…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Would you please kill him for me?</p>
<p><strong>bivouac</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo, wait! I got news.
There’s about to be an attack.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You’re about to get hit,
Cuervo. It’s Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You told me he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I thought he was, but he
came back.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Oh Cuervo…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: It’s so good to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Where’s Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: He’s… near.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’re stalling, Eddie. Talk, you
little gringo!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo, look out behind
you!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’ve lied to me for the very last
time.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: She’s overloaded! We’re too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Somebody get off!</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: We’re not gonna make it over the fuckin’
mountain!</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It’s
passed into restricted space, heading this way.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Is it Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Commander, I’m getting radio contact
with the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Boost it.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get ready, shitheads. We’re comin’ in.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the
prototype?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>plisske</strong>: Now give me the real one.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I couldn’t make the switch,
Snake. I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Now we’re even, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Commander Malloy - he’s got lots of
company.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Battle stations…</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I think we’ve burned off enough fuel. We
may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Can you land?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: No. The right skid’s broken. If I try to
set it down she’ll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.
Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: My name is no longer Carjack. Will you
please get that through your fucking head?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t shoot! They can drag us down into
the sea.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Take the controls!</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Where’s Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Cuervo.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: If you get to America -
let’s do lunch.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Snake, look.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Where the hell is he going?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: It’s taking all the power we’ve got to
hover.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Jump out. Head for the treeline and
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: All right, baby. Don’t be too rough on me.
We’re gonna land.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where’s the anti-toxin…?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Give me the prototype.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real
one.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Give me the goddamn shot!</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: It was all a fake, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: You were injected with glucose. There is no
Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from
anything we gave you.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: C’mon, Snake - it’s L.A. Everything’s phony,
you know that.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and
you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You’re free, Plissken. But if you even so
much as break wind on a country road I’ll crush you like a bug.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Commander… Look what we found.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You didn’t finish the mission, Plissken.
We’ll have to do that for you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Got a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You’re gonna have to learn to respect the
law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no
drinking, do drugs, no women unless you’re married, no guns, no foul
language. It’s a brand new day for you, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: The name’s Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>duty sergeant</strong>: We’re being attacked, Commander. The
north wall.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Forces hostile to the United States
grow strong in the late 20th Century.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: A great moral crisis grips the
nation as social revolution and a breakdown of the criminal justice
system threaten society.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: To protect and defend its citizens,
the United States Police Force is formed.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: The population of Los Angeles grows
to 40 million. The city is ravaged by crime and immorality. A
Presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy the
city in divine retribution.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the
Richter scale hits at 12:59 p.m., August 23rd, in the year 2000.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: After the devastation, the
constitution is damned, and the newly elected President accepts a
lifetime term of office.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Fearing a massive terrorist
invasion from South America, the United States prepares for war. The
Great Wall is built along the southern border, cutting off the flow of
illegal aliens.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Street gangs, South American
terrorists and the criminally insane capture Los Angeles, the once-great
City of Angels.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: Now an island on the border of
civilization, L.A. is a no-man’s land of chaos, anarchy and
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: The United States Police Force,
like an army, is encamped in the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>
<p><strong>female narrator</strong>: The President’s first act as
Permanent Commander-in-Chief is Directive 17: protect and defend the
United States from this island of the damned, Hell on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: He’s been the Force’s Most Wanted Man
for 10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I can tell you, the
excitement around here is… Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Commander Malloy. They’re bringing him out,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: So we finally got him.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: Hold one! The door is opening!</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A.</p>
<p><strong>police voice</strong>: You are now entering the Deportation
Center. You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United
States of America.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces,
Black Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts. Youngest man ever
decorated by the President.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: You’ve been convicted of 27 moral
crimes, Plissken. The murder of an Internal Revenue agent. The
kidnapping of a bank president. Gun fighting for profit. The list goes
on and on…</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: You used to respect the law. Served
your country like no man before you. Role model to a generation.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: What happened to you, war hero? You
were the best we had.</p>
<p><strong>police voice</strong>: You are sentenced to permanent
expulsion beyond the borders of the U.S. You now have the option to
repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises. If you elect
this option, notify the Cleric Sergeant in your Processing Area.</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: The whole world’s watching. Every
good and decent person who works and hard and follows the rules. What
would say to them?</p>
<p><strong>police anchor</strong>: What would you say to all of us who
believed in you, who looked up to you, who thought you stood for right
over wrong, good over evil? Be my guest. What do you have to say,
Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Call me Snake.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a
database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of
the curve.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can
pull it off - not an army, not a man.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Zero emotional developments. Total lack of
compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: How you doin’ Plissken? You like the
watch?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You assholes didn’t bring me here to give
me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What’ya want?</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Get to it.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of
government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab. The
President’s daughter, Utopia, was among them.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: To the American people - it is time to rise
up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy
of lies and terror.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We
scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Today is Day One of a brand new world. The
days of the empire are finished. To the President - my father, you know
what this is.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: You know what it will do. Unless you
abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I will use it - on you.</p>
<p><strong>congressman</strong>: Utopia, please. Give us the prototype.
If something should happen -</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: It will be in my hands - and the hands of my
lover.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man
I’ve ever known. I’m on my way to his arms.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Somehow during the tour, she came into
possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Utopia became depressed after her mother’s
suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She’d
punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a
time. Somebody else was in there with her.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian
terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
then tried to erase them. She missed this fragment on the end of her
last tape. Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank -
and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to
corrupt. Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Sad story. You got a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Shut up, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What’s the little black box do?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Top secret. Only on a need to know.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: And I don’t need to know. So fuck you, I’m
goin’ to Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That’s right, big shot. Unless you do what
we want you’re not coming back.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: So what’s the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
find the President’s daughter, secure the box, and bring ’em both out -
and I’m free?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That’s the deal.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Tell the President to adopt. I think I’ll
like L.A.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: If you bring out the prototype, you’ll
receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in
the United States. Just like in ’97. Remember New York, Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: It’s the President, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I give you my word. Put the prototype
into my hands, and you’re a free man.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I can see you’re real concerned about your
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Well, I’ll think it over.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’ve been doin’ that all my life. Might as
well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Well, enjoy it, war hero, cause you got 10
hours to live.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Wait a minute, what are you talkin’
about?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Having second thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Maybe. But you’re not putting any shit in
me this time.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You don’t understand. It’s already in
you.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it’s
swimming in your bloodstream. It’ll start to take effect in 9 hours.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: It’s a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system
shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty
sight.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Of course there’s an anti-toxin. Neutralizes
the virus immediately upon injection. We’ll give it to you, but you have
to do us this little favor.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Didn’t think we were that stupid, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: We’re holographs.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get this crap out of me.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working
with you, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Call me Snake.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Very sweet little weapon. Core burner.
Magnesium ammo. 500 extra rounds. Two 9mm handguns. Oral projectile.
Mouth dart. Hold it in your mouth for ten seconds, the coating
dissolves, it becomes a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Urolite. It’ll stun the enemy for several
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted
in her arm. You can locate her with this.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo
enhancers. Like miniaturized grenades. Blows through anything.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: L.A. is in a constant state of warfare.
Gangs fighting for the right to rule.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: Heavy Third World connections. They get
weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island
from the south.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Some areas have power - they’re on line to
San Onofre.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’ll need to know more about this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Only a handful of people are aware of its
existence. Let’s just say it’s the ultimate defensive weapon.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Defense against what?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: There’s a war about to be declared, or
didn’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Third World wants to live like we do - and
they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready
to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the
border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: So what does this thing do?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: All you need to know is get it back here by
5 a.m.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You’re going over by submarine. One-man
submersible. Nuclear powered.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where do I put ashore?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the
mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up
Utopia’s tracer there. Once you go inside, you’re on your own. You know
what you have to do with the girl, don’t you? We have to spare this
nation her trial - for treason.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: So you want me to take her out? Is that an
order from the President?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Let’s just say it’s what’s best for the
country.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: By the way - who gives me the
anti-toxin?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: A medical team will be standing by.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Not you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Thought you might try that. First clip is
filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Com check.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: I’m here, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Stand by for launch. Ignitor. Fuel rod
injection.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: She’s in the green.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Lock fuel rods.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Locked.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Nuclear turbine to 75% power.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: 75% power.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Hands on switches and counting. 5…4…3…2…1.
Launch.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken, watch your speed. Lots of
obstructions down there.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken… do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: His reactor’s starting to overheat.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken, slow down the sub. You’re
overloading the power plant.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken…?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken…?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Where’s the submarine? It’s disappeared off
our screens.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: It’s history. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Too bad about your boat, man. Supposed to
be some swells out here tonight. Big ones. You like to surf?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: You look kinda familiar. You hang out
around here much?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hey, man. I know who you are. You’re Snake
Plissken. Man, I can’t believe you’re really here.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Down that way.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Be careful. Some real strange dudes
hangin’ out there these days.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hey Snake - what’re you doin’ around here,
man? I heard they busted you up real good in Cleveland…</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin’ noise!</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Take cover, fool.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Let’s take him.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hey, what’s going down, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m looking for somebody.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Who ain’t?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Say, is it true what they say about
Cleveland, man?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can
always shift down and mojo with us anytime.</p>
<p><strong>blonde hooker</strong>: It’s winnin’ time, baby. How about
you and I do some celebrating?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>blonde hooker</strong>: You must be new around here. You look
familiar. Have I done you before?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>blonde hooker</strong>: Easy, man, easy. It’s Cuervo Jones’
gang. Mescalito Justice. He’s the big boss man ’round here tonight. He’s
gonna take down the police and make ’em kiss his fine ass.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Later, Snake. We finish it later.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Snake Plissken, right?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Wow! Snake Plissken!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You’re a star in your own
right, you know that? Hey, I’m Map To The Stars Eddie. How you
doin’?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where’d they go?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Man, I’d love to have your
autograph, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I’ve been hearing about you
ever since that New York deal back in the 90’s. You’re one smooth
operator. Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death’s Head, one to
Slasher Smith…?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Who? You mean Cuervo Jones?
He’s the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President’s daughter.
Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Location.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo’s got a place near
Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I’ve been there,
y’know.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Nice little gizmo you got
there. Look, Snake. I’ve got connections in this town. You need
something, I’m your man.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey - you can’t go there,
Snake. You can’t walk through Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Specimen moving west on Sunset.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Halt! Where are you going? Are you here
for the auction?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Welcome to Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Hi, Snake. It’s so great to meet you. My
name’s Taslima. I’m a fan of yours.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: A little bit. But pretty soon I’m gonna be
dead. So are you, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I can’t believe I got caught. I run with
Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang. Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up
sometimes. I forget stuff.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I left my boyfriend’s place tonight, took a
wrong turn… Oh, Snake, I’m really kind of out of it sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: They live here, used to be like us. But
after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only
way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.
Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: No screamin’ shit.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Oh no, it’s the Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: I’ve never seen more beautiful
specimens. There will be no auction tonight. These body parts will go to
those who need them the most.</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: What a beautiful blue eye. It’s a shame
you only have one.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Snake, help me.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t follow me.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: You need help.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Like hell I do.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Down this way.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: This is a dead end. You took us into a
dead end!</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I just thought you wanted to get away. I
didn’t know you wanted to go someplace.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
these buildings.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
gun!</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: How do we get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Sewers. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Down there.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Snake - what is it?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: How the hell am I supposed to know? This
is your damn city.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: What’re you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Looking to get out.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Good. I want you out. This is my
sewer.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: You’re Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Yes. Isn’t he cool?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
Pendejo Bob.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Those damn patients are coming back.
You’d better climb aboard.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: I use the eye and the music to scare em
off. They’re so whacked out, man, it works great. Chased a whole bunch
of em right off the edge there a few months ago.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: How far down does it go?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Don’t know - never do hear em land.
Earthquake opened it up.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: I own this whole place. Used to work
here in the old days. I was right in this room when the big one hit.
What a mess. We were waist high in shit. Everybody else ran, but not me.
I stayed at my post. Now it’s all mine. I brought my whole family, my
amigos, down here to live with me.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Gun runners.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Hey, it’s a living, baby.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Why don’t you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
to China, take an airplane to Brazil? Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do
you stay?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I don’t know. Somehow, I just can’t
leave.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Y’know, L.A.’s not such a bad place,
Snake. We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem -
five hours.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: All the sewers are collapsed under
Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Comes out near the Santa Monica
Freeway. Just follow the signs. Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn
left.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
You’re welcome down here anytime. Anytime at all.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The freeway’s over there. But, Snake - I
don’t think it’s such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The freeways are dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Goodbye, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Sun’s coming up in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: UV’s gonna be bad today. I have a friend
who’s got a place near here. We can crash there if you want, Snake. I’d
love to take care of you. Make you feel good.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I changed my mind. I’m going with you,
wherever you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: The freeway.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I know that. There are people in some of
these cars.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: It’s where they live. I guess after
everything happened, they just needed to do what they’d always done
before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their
windows and sleep.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: What are you gonna do in Venice?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Find Cuervo Jones.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: No! Stay away, Snake. He’s mucho
muerte.</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: Run, Snake…They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>taslima</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hop in, Snake!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Snake - that was great.
They almost burned your ass off!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Too many people know where
you’re going, Snake. That’s not good. Delgado and his men were back
there waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Delgado?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo Jones’ right-hand
man. One tough hombre. You don’t understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants
to unify the island. We’re on the move, man. Big time.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Stop the damn car.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I said pull over.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: All right. Anything for you,
Snake. Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones’ place.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Right over there.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Pretty neat, huh? This is
Cuervo’s car. He lets me use it sometimes. Not to worry, Snake. You were
just shot with a fun-gun. You feel it?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Pure mesh, man. 100-proof
artery choker.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Like Cuervo says, when the
hit pulls you down to one inch from death, that is living, man.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You should’ve talked to me
first, Snake. I could’ve set this whole thing up. I’m actually Cuervo’s
agent, you know.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: And I’d love to represent
you, too. We could make a bundle together. I know I could really help
your career…I mean, you’re a legend and all - but the last couple years,
man, it’s like you’ve fallen off the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Come on, Cuervo. I delivered
him, didn’t I? All I’m asking for is what you promised.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Carrot juice? Laced with tequila,
Snake. Good for you. No? Your health.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’re coming out of it, Snake. It
hurts real bad. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Dying isn’t good enough for you. You
need pain. You’ll never make it to where you want to go without a little
pain.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
typical of American idealism. The old west, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Man against the sky. The individual.
Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much in America, Snake. You remind
them of what they used to be.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Here is the real L.A., Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: The poor. The old. The lost. People
without hope.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Do you know what they want? One word.
Liberation. They want a chance to live - before it’s all gone. They’ve
been hated for too long - Now it’s their turn.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
Actress.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: You said I could hold it.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You never heard of Snake Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: He doesn’t look like his picture. I bet he’s
fake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Now go get dressed. We have things to
do.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Are we going to eat soon? I’m starved.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Ooww!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Go on now. Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: I’m going to show her what it means to
be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life. Given her
love, Snake. Everybody needs love.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You want to hook up with us? Join the
revolution? We’re all getting out of here tomorrow night. We’re gonna
rule the world. Come with us, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: No? Too bad. Well, I told you we’d
finish it later. So guess what? It’s later.</p>
<p><strong>delgado</strong>: You’re mine now, Snake. All mine.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Shot clock!</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Welcome aboard, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: The time is now. We are the strongest.
If we go together, the others will come. We go for everything, Xi-Ping.
But we go together. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Your brother died owing me, so I’m taking
it out in trade. I need a favor…</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Sure, Snake. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I need to get across the court now…
without drawing attention to myself.</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Like you ain’t gonna stick out like a sore
thumb. But we’ll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll.
Now let’s kick some butt!</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: You play much pick-up ball, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
man.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: It’s that weird guy again.</p>
<p><strong>jamaal</strong>: Snake! Shot clock!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Snake, man… Great
shot!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: That man in black. He’s very
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>xi-ping</strong>: One eye?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Yes. We gotta dump him.</p>
<p><strong>xi-ping</strong>: What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: I’m betting the cops sent him in. Man,
I do not need this. I got a war to win.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where are they going?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Oh, man… You didn’t have to
hit me, Snake. I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Bankrupt City. The Happy
Kingdom. Snake, Cuervo’s hooked up with Xi-Ping. He is primetime, man -
Mister Bad News. The rest of the city’s joining up with ’em. You’re shit
outta luck, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I could’ve helped you. We
coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you’d listen…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Lemme go…!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Kill him, kill him…!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Good thinkin’, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: My… father sent you… didn’t he? He sent you
to kill me…</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I said go!</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Don’t take it back. Don’t give it to him.
Please. Let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: What does this thing do?</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: So long, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: He jumped. Down there. He’s
dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You said I could be
Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Give it.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Sure, Cuervo, but look here.
I’ve done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it
all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.</p>
<p><strong>prototype voice</strong>: I am now armed and ready for use.
Use extreme caution. The location of the effected blast area can only be
determined by the orbital position of the SatStar Ring.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: This is turning out to be my lucky
day. Get this asshole outta here.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo, wait. Please…</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Cuervo…?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’re my woman, you understand? You
don’t let anybody take you away from me without a fight.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: I tried…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless
you give your life. You fight till you’re dead. Then I forgive you.
Understand? Understand?</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Look, baby. They’re all mine.</p>
<p><strong>police voice</strong>: Full stage battle alert. All personnel
to battle stations.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: A sky full of enemy choppers on radar.
Moving over the city to the southeast.</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Commander - massive vehicle and troop
movement on the ground. All major streets leading to the southeast.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What’re they doing?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Getting ready to invade.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: So where’s Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Hey, Snake. You okay? I heard gunfire
down here… Never been down this far before… Grab this.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Now hang on.</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Hey, Snake…where are you?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m in another opening… Storm drain… There
may be another way up to you…</p>
<p><strong>pendejo bob</strong>: Snake… Snake!</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great
shot. You look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Could be a big one comin’ any minute
now…</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where’s… Cuervo Jones…?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Long gone. You’ll never catch up with him
now, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The
whole town’s gonna be there. Things changin’ fast around here, Snake.
It’s not the same as the old days, man.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Take me there…</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: You ain’t doin’ so good, Snake. You need
help. You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be
partners, but they split up.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo
Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: She’s connected with the Black Cowboys,
and they don’t take shit from nobody…</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Yo’, man. It’s a big one.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Tsunami, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Surf’s up big time.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Get ready, Snake. It’s gonna be some kinda
ride.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Let the front edge pick you up. Don’t get
on your board till it peaks.</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Don’t lose it, man. You slip off your
board and it’s the Big Wipeout, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Hang on, Snake!</p>
<p><strong>pipeline</strong>: Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Listen up. I need directions. Downtown.
Somebody named Hershe.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Sure, Snake. No problem. You
gonna kill me?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I couldn’t help it, Snake. I
had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Cease fire with the bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Right. Keep goin’ straight.
Two blocks down, turn right.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours.
Have the news media standing by for my coronation. I’m arriving in
style.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: He must be bouncing the signal from one of
our communications satellites.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: That means CableNet has already picked it
up. This thing’s going live all over the country.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: It’s a brand new day comin’ up this
morning, and I’m just so proud to be leading the parade. See you soon,
putos.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: The prototype appears to be armed,
Mr. President. Shall I begin evacuation?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Does he know how to activate it?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the
button.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: What about Plissken? He could still be -</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Forget him. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That may not be true, Mr. President. He’s
one tough case. Plissken’s been dead so many times I can’t count. But he
never stays down.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait
for Plissken, or surrender. It’s your decision.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Hershe. How’re you
doin’?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hershe - it’s Snake Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Yeah, Hershe. I brought him
to see you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: What’s in it for me?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Wait a minute. I know that voice. You’re
Carjack Malone.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: You two know each other?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You owe me. You left me holdin’ everything
back there in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Hershe, you were in Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O’Shay.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: I was called away on urgent business,
Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: All right, so I made another deal.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I got a new deal for you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You help me, you live.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: I wouldn’t be doin’ that, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: We have a little arrangement. Anything
happens to me, you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: I see your point. What’s the favor?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the
Kingdom. I got one hour.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Dream on, blue eye.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Say goodnight, Carjack.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two
armies. No one gets near him.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: And he’s got the prototype.
And the girl. He holds all the cards.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Exactly what is this prototype? What does it
do?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You push the button, it
sends a signal to a ring of space defense satellites. They’re orbiting
bombs. Nukes. They explode. Huge space burst. EMP. Electromagnetic
Pulse. It happens instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP shuts down
every power source below the satellites - instantly. All electrical
devices, computers, cars, airplanes, cities. It’s the dark ages
again.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: So whoever has it runs the show.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: They were gonna use it on
South America, Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Only Cuervo’s got it now.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: And that ring of satellites
will be in position over the U.S. at 5:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: How do you know all this?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I used to represent the guy
who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: So what’s the deal, gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: We get the girl and the prototype. And we
get out.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: All of us?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Me too?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we
gonna go? What’s the payoff?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: I’d like to get out but I don’t have enough
money.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: The President’s promised to give whoever
helps me 1 million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of
them.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Uh-uh. Bluebacks.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Aw, come on, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Bluebacks. I’m not bullshittin’. I swear
to God.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: I don’t know, sounds thin to me.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones
rules the world?</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: No, that sucks. How are we getting out?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin’
things up as you go along. That’s why I cut out on you in Cleveland.
You’re just a bum like the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>mojo dellasandro</strong>: Use the air.</p>
<p><strong>mojo dellasandro</strong>: They’re burning. Santa Anas. The
night wind.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: What’re you talking about, Mojo?</p>
<p><strong>mojo dellasandro</strong>: Death from above…</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I don’t know about this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t like it, don’t come.</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Where’d you get these rigs, Carjack?</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you
understand, cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I got an idea, Snake. This
looks like the prototype, right?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah, kinda.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: So maybe we can pull off a
Texas switch on Cuervo.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: If he lets you get close enough.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: The wind’s up. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: See you in hell, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: If I’m late, Carjack, don’t start without
me.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: They’re simple people. They love a
party. We’re gonna throw them one hell of a party when we get to
America. Right?</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Put a smile on your face.</p>
<p><strong>bivouac</strong>: Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Are you ready for the New World?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Yeah. The place kept
changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed
’em.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Snake. We need some kind of diversion.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it!
I made it! Wait for me…</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey Cuervo…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Would you please kill him for me?</p>
<p><strong>bivouac</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo, wait! I got news.
There’s about to be an attack.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: You’re about to get hit,
Cuervo. It’s Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You told me he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I thought he was, but he
came back.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Oh Cuervo…</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: It’s so good to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: Where’s Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: He’s… near.</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’re stalling, Eddie. Talk, you
little gringo!</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Cuervo, look out behind
you!</p>
<p><strong>cuervo jones</strong>: You’ve lied to me for the very last
time.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: She’s overloaded! We’re too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Somebody get off!</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: We’re not gonna make it over the fuckin’
mountain!</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It’s
passed into restricted space, heading this way.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Is it Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Commander, I’m getting radio contact
with the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Boost it.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Get ready, shitheads. We’re comin’ in.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the
prototype?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>plisske</strong>: Now give me the real one.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: I couldn’t make the switch,
Snake. I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Now we’re even, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: Commander Malloy - he’s got lots of
company.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Battle stations…</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: I think we’ve burned off enough fuel. We
may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: Can you land?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: No. The right skid’s broken. If I try to
set it down she’ll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.
Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.</p>
<p><strong>hershe</strong>: My name is no longer Carjack. Will you
please get that through your fucking head?</p>
<p><strong>spinal</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Don’t shoot! They can drag us down into
the sea.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Take the controls!</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Where’s Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: Hey, Cuervo.</p>
<p><strong>map to the stars eddie</strong>: If you get to America -
let’s do lunch.</p>
<p><strong>utopia</strong>: Snake, look.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Where the hell is he going?</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: It’s taking all the power we’ve got to
hover.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Jump out. Head for the treeline and
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: All right, baby. Don’t be too rough on me.
We’re gonna land.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Where’s the anti-toxin…?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Give me the prototype.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real
one.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Give me the goddamn shot!</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: It was all a fake, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>brazen</strong>: You were injected with glucose. There is no
Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from
anything we gave you.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: C’mon, Snake - it’s L.A. Everything’s phony,
you know that.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and
you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You’re free, Plissken. But if you even so
much as break wind on a country road I’ll crush you like a bug.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Commander… Look what we found.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You didn’t finish the mission, Plissken.
We’ll have to do that for you.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: Got a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You’re gonna have to learn to respect the
law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no
drinking, do drugs, no women unless you’re married, no guns, no foul
language. It’s a brand new day for you, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>plissken</strong>: The name’s Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>duty sergeant</strong>: We’re being attacked, Commander. The
north wall.</p>
