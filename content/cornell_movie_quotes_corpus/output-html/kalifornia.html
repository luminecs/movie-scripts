<h1 id="kalifornia">kalifornia</h1>
<p><strong>pretty teenage girl</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Her father worked the night shift here. Most
nights he’d bring her with him. She was eleven years old.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: This is it. This is the where he’d take her
whenever he had the urge to molest her.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Of course! Nobody would have heard her cries
over the noise of the machines.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Damn! This defroster never works…</p>
<p><strong>pretty teenage girl</strong>: …Mmm… feels good.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Have a problem with your car?</p>
<p><strong>pretty teenage girl</strong>: No. My problem’s with men.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: This is where she murdered her first victim.
They found his body over in the corner, shot through the head.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: They found her second victim over there.</p>
<p><strong>pretty teenage girl</strong>: Okay if I smoke?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: …sure.</p>
<p><strong>pretty teenage girl</strong>: My matches are all wet. You got
a lighter?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Yeah. It’s here somewhere. It’s my wife’s
car. Ah… there it is.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: She lured them here with the promise of sex.
Imagine the anger and hatred she must have felt returning to this place.
Did she use that to help her pull the trigger?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Shhhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>pretty teenage girl</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: …nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Are you dead or alive?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Brian?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Obviously!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Man or woman?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Man.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Real or fictional.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Real.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Ted Bundy.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What a guess!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Doesn’t count, she’s disqualified.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Because you’ve been living with him, and his
thesis for the last year and a half. He’s probably been researching Ted
Bundy all week.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Carl, you are the world’s worst loser!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Any word from that gallery?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Apprehensive. Let’s not forget these are
the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California’s loaded
with galleries.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You mean ‘Ted Bundy’s’ finally agreed to
leave?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Soon as he finishes his thesis.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Listen, Eric’s been “finishing” his for over
three years now.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah, well Brian’s got ’til the end of the
summer, then I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I’m sorry, but I just can’t see you veggin’
out in LA-LA LAND.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Oh, I don’t know… I think that once I dye my
hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan… I could be
veggin’ out with the best of ’em… Like fer shurr!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m talking about the mind and culpability of
a serial killer. Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right
and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Oh, here we go again. Let’s just lay it all at
the altar of misfiring synapses, amok biochemicals and horrendous
childhoods.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look, it’s a fact, most of these people
suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance. That enough Tequila?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Probably not…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: The answer is research and treatment under
hospital supervised conditions, not the electric chair!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, until it’s your mother’s head they find
in the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Executing the killer wouldn’t bring my mother
back.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Thank god!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah, but it’d sure make you feel better,
wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, it wouldn’t make me feel better.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: …Looking for this?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: If I have to listen to one more “tweed” talk
about his dissertation, I’m going to throw up.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Label it anyway you want, the bottom line is
these people are evil, plain and simple.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Okay, now you want to talk about good versus
evil? Well then let’s start with Adam and Eve and the snake.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Who do I have to blow to get out of
here?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: A… I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: …Be right there.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: The Antichrist’ll be a woman, in a man’s
body. Seven heads and seven tails.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Make that to go.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …Size 6.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: That’s right ain’t it, size 6?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Happy birthday Adele.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early, you are so sweet.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you
know when she gets the red shoes.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well Dorothy, why don’t you hand me that
chili there.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Tonight turned out to be pretty
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: The party?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: The warehouse. I’m not that drunk.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It was definitely the high point of the
evening.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Just being there where it really happened. It
was different… more visceral.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Mmm… I love it when you talk like that.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You thirsty Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Bet that feels good, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Now if that ain’t Momma’s little angel.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …two more victims last night, when a
twenty pound rock smashed through the windshield of their car…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: This was the third such attack in the
past month and while an extensive police operation is underway… no
arrests have yet been made.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Oh… I forgot to tell you, Mr. Diebold was by
again yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: He said, if he ain’t got the rest of his
money by the end of the month, he’s gonna “kick us the… F-U-C-K outta
here.”</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: He said that, huh? Cursed in front of
you?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You gonna talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: If he comes back, don’t answer the door.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Suppose he hears me inside?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I picked up some Chinese. Did you hear from
the gallery?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You got your slides back.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic… not
suitable for mass consumption… one of those… I forget. Who cares.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Christ Brian I’m dying here… you are too,
you just don’t know it yet. You’re too busy working on that damned
thesis… And, thing is… when you finally do finish it, it’s just gonna
get filed away on some shelf at the University Library… then what?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I thought you wanted to be a writer.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …I do.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Then you can write anywhere. Let’s get out
of here, while we still can.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Carrie, come on… we can leave anytime we…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No we can’t. We can never leave once you
start talking about tenure… and vacation pay… and parking privileges
and… oh shit! let’s just go to California now, right now, before it’s
too late.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …just like that?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Just like that. Load up the Lincoln… point
it West… stop when we hit the fucking ocean.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: That’s half the kick anyway. Doing something
you’ve never done before. Experiencing something… different. Something…
unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …These are great.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Adele, who’s car’s that out…</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What are you doin’ here? I ain’t supposed to
be at the Parole Office ’til tomorrow, two o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Social call.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: You’re supposed to call me when you
lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left
quite a mess behind there.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Wasn’t my fault…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …It was dangerous there and they treated me
like shit.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Yeah… Well you never have been
‘treated right’… Have you? Your father was pickin’ on you when he threw
you out of the house for stealing the tires off his truck. The Marines
misunderstood you when they gave you that dishonorable discharge.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: …The police were way out of line
when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no
doubt God’ll be pickin’ on you on Judgement Day…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I ain’t got nothing against God. It’s the
people he let come into the world… lot of them should have been stopped
at the door. What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: That girlfriend of yours ain’t much
for housekeeping, is she.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I’m thinking about moving…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Maybe down to Texas… Probably get some work
on them offshore oil rigs. Hear the pay’s good… hell, the weather’s got
to be better’n here.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: What are you talking about? You know
you can’t leave the state. What you can do is get a job.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: You be at this personnel office,
Friday, three o’clock sharp.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: …Janitor’s job.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Oh man… come on, I don’t want no janitor
job.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Hey, I don’t give two shits about
what you want or don’t want… I’m telling you to be there Friday, three
o’clock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner. You
understand?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You oughta think about putting a bag over
your head… Might cure them hiccups.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey. I didn’t have the heart to wake you.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Thanks. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, I sat down with my tapes and your
photographs, which are great by the way… and I started writing.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: So how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …I think it’s the best stuff I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …and I think I know why.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Because I was there. And for a moment that
night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: This mean your finally going to finish your
thesis?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look, fuck the thesis. I think there’s a book
here. Your photographs and my research, together.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: A book on the warehouse murders?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: A book on some of the most infamous murderers
in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I
want you to photograph it.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What I’m thinking is, we can drop down
through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it’s a
straight shot into California. “We don’t stop… until we hit the fucking
ocean.”</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It’s about fucking time, Kessler! I’d just
about given up on you.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: We don’t have enough money, but we’ll figure
something out.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …It’s either the best idea I’ve had in a long
time… or there’s way too much MSG in this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>diebold</strong>: Hold on a minute there boy!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>diebold</strong>: Goddamit, you’re gonna settle up that rent
here and now.</p>
<p><strong>diebold</strong>: I’ve had it with your bullshit boy. I want
my money.</p>
<p><strong>diebold</strong>: You sonofabitch! Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>diebold</strong>: That’s it! You tell him… I want you both
the fuck out of here by Sunday or I’m gonna call the Police.</p>
<p><strong>diebold</strong>: …You won’t be laughing come Sunday little
girl.</p>
<p><strong>diebold</strong>: Elvis! Get the fuck off him!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You know, they say one of these days…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …the whole thing’s going to slide into the
ocean… Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: “Looking for someone to take turns at the
wheel and share expenses… on a week long cross country blue- highways
tour of historic murder sites…” You gotta be kidding. Who in their right
mind would want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …I would.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Like I said…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Where’s the personnel office at?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: First door on the left.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early? You down there?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What’s up Adele? Dinner ready?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Tell me more about California.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well… for one thing… They think faster out
there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes
people stupid, that’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I guess that’d explain why there’s so many
stupid people around here.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Yeah, and in California you never have to buy
fruit ’cause it’s all on the trees everywhere you turn… …and, ’course
there ain’t no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal… And I
heard your first month’s rent is free; state law. I figure ’til we get
settled we can just move around month to month…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What’ll we do out there?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well… the very first thing we’re gonna do… is
get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa’ that
famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You know… I read once… Ain’t nothin’ on that
big old moon ’cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Bull. That ain’t right… Government sends
people there all the time, just don’t want us to know about it.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Don’t be long now, dinner’s ’bout ready.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What did he sound like on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Real polite. Kept calling me ‘sir.’</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I like that.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I still think we should have met them
first.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Beggars can’t be choosers. They were the only
ones who answered the ride share note, remember?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Please God, we’re gonna be stuck with these
people for a week, don’t let them be as boring as Brian’s friends.
Anything… but that.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh, yeah… He had a real thick accent right
outta “Deliverance.” “Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass
up in them woods!”</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Funny, very funny.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: “Aintry? This river don’t go to Aintry.”</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: We shouldn’t be doin’ this, Early. You
leavin’ the state, ridin’ around with strangers… besides, what kinda
people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What if they’re dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: They ain’t dangerous Adele. They’re
writers.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early Grayce!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Yeah I left him with the car… We’re all
squared up now.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What kind of a person would carry a cactus in
her purse!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding me, they look like
Okies!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Jesus… They’ve probably got five bucks
between them. Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Lighten up…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Geez, they look kinda weird.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You just smile, let me do all the
talking.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: How many times you gonna tell me that?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: As many times as it takes.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hi I’m Brian… Early, and you must be
Adele.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hi, I’m Adele.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Carrie.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I like your hair.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …I said, I like your hair.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Tight fit.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Best kind.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele
haven’t had time for breakfast, Early.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well, it’s like this, Mr. Kessler.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Brian.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well, it’s like this, Bri’. I don’t eat much
in the mornin’, never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager’s
my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: It’s because of what he read in a book once…
That folks needin’ breakfast is a myth, or whatever, put out by those
cereal people.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: So what do you do Early?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Oh… I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror
factory, or I used to…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: One night we figured out how much bad luck he
must have comin’ from all them mirrors he broke… Four hundred and ninety
four years to work it all off… After he dies, he’ll have to keep coming
back to earth over and over and over…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Karma.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Karma… You know, if you do something bad to
somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: That French ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: So Adele, did Early happen to mention the
places we’ll be stopping at?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Yeah Bri’ I did.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Are you takin’ the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Is it hard to learn?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You gonna talk to the people who did those
murders?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s a good idea. Unfortunately most of
them have been executed.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: His Parole Officer.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Right, I talked to you on the phone.
They say it’s a torch job, that sound like your boy?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Where would we find him?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch
said he was thinking of moving to Texas.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Without his car?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: What about the owner of the house…
…this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: No, but I can tell you he’s not
gonna be too happy about this.</p>
<p><strong>laborer</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: …Diebold?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: …That’d be my guess.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: Looks like somebody cut off his ring
finger.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Well now I’d say that’s the least of
Mr. Diebold’s problems.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: All right, who gets the… …water.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Here you go Bri’. Got a couple a bags of
chips and some jerky, just holler if you want some.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Can’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: How much do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Guess I don’t know the first thing about
cameras.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Well, the first thing… is you need film.
Preferably black and white.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You wouldn’t have any color film, would
ya?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I like things in color, pink, purple, and
red. I dunno, black and white is kinda… boring.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You just aim and press the button.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Look, Pigeon Forge!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I’ve heard of that! It’s where Dolly Parton
has her park. “Dollywood”. I just think that’s so clever. Hollywood.
Dollywood. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Shush, Adele.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early, can we stop there… just for a little
while.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …I’ve always wanted to go there… It could be
such fun.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: The Novaks are all gone but the fence that
Michael Zaruba was hired to put up is still here.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: The Novaks embraced the young drifter as one
of their own.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hey you two.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Give me a smile now.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Neighbors said he was a quiet young man, who
was often seen pushing the children on the swing set.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Everything was fine until the day the family
ran out of work for Michael, and had to ask him to leave.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Sorry, Early… Could you step out the way, for
a second?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: The first one to die was the nine year old
daughter…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …My name’s Brian, what’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …Could I speak to your parents?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Pa! There’s more of them.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m a writer, I’m working on a book about
famous murderers.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …I’m sure you’re aware that this is the Novak
house…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …I mean, this was the Novak house… With your
permission I’d like to come in and photograph…</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Goddamned ghouls…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: We could have been in and out of there in
less than ten minutes…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Hey, I got some great stuff… it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It’s okay… okay?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …That house is part of American history now,
whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Forget about it Bri’. I wouldn’t be surprised
if that Karma thing don’t come back and get him.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well we’ve come three hundred miles so far.
Not a bad day’s haul.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You got any family or friends in California,
Early?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Nope… You?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Me neither. How ’bout you Carrie?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …Well, least we got each other. That’s
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Thanks Bri’, I’ll get the next one. Think
it’s time we hit the sack.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Sweet dreams.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You mean because I object to having somebody
take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I’m eating I’m
prejudiced?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: He can’t help the way he was raised. I kinda
feel sorry for him.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn’t get
a whiff of that sock?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Bitch, bitch, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Up yours.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …heard that too.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Can you believe thirty bucks for this room…
for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early, sing me a song.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Which one.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hey can we go to that Chinese restaurant when
we get to Los Angeles? You know, to see all them famous footprints?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Only if they let me put mine down too.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look Carrie, we’re gonna be stuck with these
people for a week…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …And all I’m saying is I think we ought to
try and get along with them. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You try, I’m gonna pretend they’re with
somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Carrie.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Pretty smooth how he stiffed us on
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: He didn’t stiff us. He paid for the gas
remember.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m telling you he’s nearly broke and we’re
going to end up paying for those two.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You finished?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Um, maybe… maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Um… Funky fucking sock.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …and what’s with that hair? Is that grease
or motor oil or what?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …you believe that tattoo? Looks like he had
another girls name there and carved it out.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …and that body odor.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Morning…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Bri’.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Where’s Adele?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: She wasn’t feeling so good.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Nah… Don’t eat breakfast. Never have.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Ah sir… sir.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: We ah… don’t have a liquor license here.
So I’m afraid…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well don’t be, I got plenty more where this
one came from.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You cut your hair.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early cut it. …Once he gets an idea in his
head there’s no holding him back.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Nice job Early.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …Need a hand with those bags?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No, thanks, I can manage.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: All set?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: This the book your writing?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: It’s just a work in progress, kinda
rough.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: This guy killed a mess of people.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Henry Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted
of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Wonder what all them people done made him so
mad?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Here Bri’ let me do that.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: How did he get away with it for so long
anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: He almost always killed strangers. Spent
years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to
track him down.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You dropped this.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early Grayce if this ain’t your lucky
day.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I guess it’s your turn to pay Early.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I used to smoke before I met Early. But he
broke me of that.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Broke you?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early don’t think women should smoke or curse
or drink liquor.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: So you don’t do any of those things.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Better not, or Early’d whip me.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He whips you?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Only when I deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Hey Bri’… ah… You don’t want to go in there.
It’s a real mess, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That bad?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …Then some.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Comes to twenty eight dollars.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Call it an even thirty.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I’ll drive Bri’.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Adele, get in the back.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …Hey you’re good. Thought you said you never
played before?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I haven’t… I’m a fast learner.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …They never caught that Black Dolya Killer,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Dahlia, no.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Now why is that?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Some people think it’s because he never
killed again. He just disappeared back into society.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You don’t sound too convinced ’bout that?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I always thought it was the work of a serial
killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human
being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And
again. Until someone stopped him.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: That your… “theory”, ain’t that what they
call it?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You wanna hear mine?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Ain’t you goin’ to record it?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Early Grayce, June twenty third.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well I’ll just bet he’s still alive. Old,
livin’ in some trailer park or somethin’ somewhere, but still alive.
Thinkin’ every night ‘bout what he done. Goin’ over and over it in his
mind. How smart he was for getting away with it.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You lose!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I suppose anything’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You ever play any pool Bri’?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I can hold my own…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Hey Minnesota Fats!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Don’t forget your key.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Why’d I open my big mouth?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Why didn’t you go with them?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I told you how Early feels ’bout a woman
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: How’d you meet Early?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I was hitchhiking’ one day and he picked me
up. At first I wasn’t gonna get in on account of his car was in such
sorry shape. I said, “I ain’t never seen a white man drivin’ a car like
this.”</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: An’ he said right back, “You shouldn’t judge
by appearances little lady… this vehicle might just be a flying saucer
disguised as a car, for all you know.”</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Well, I got in and we got to talkin’, and the
next thing I know, I’d moved in with him in this old trailer. Hey!
Wouldn’t it be something if we all ended up sharing a house together in
California?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You know I can fix that haircut for you, if
you want?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You can?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I wonder if there’s any “doors” out here?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You know… “openings” to other dimensions. I
read there are a lot of them out West, mostly in the desert. They say if
you know what you’re doing, you can travel anywhere in the Universe in a
matter of seconds. Wouldn’t that come in handy?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: By the way, I’m not much of a pool
player.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Shit, it ain’t hard to play pool. I can teach
you everything ya need ta know.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Hell yeah! I’ll even spot ya a few points
first game.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re gonna hustle me?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Nah… how much money have you got?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: How do you get your cigarette to stay there
like that.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Could I try that?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It’s a portfolio of my work.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Your pictures. Can I see ’em?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You took this picture?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Took ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: No it is not!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Sorry. Boy I’ll tell ya, if Early found a
picture of me like that I’d be black and blue for a week.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You shouldn’t let him do that to you…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Adele… are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You think Early’s bad to me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Well… You’re wrong. I ain’t saying Early
ain’t never hit me… but he never hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …When I was fourteen years old three boys
raped me in the back of a truck, and beat me so bad I was in bed for
almost four months… …I feel safe with Early, most the time he treats me
pretty good. And I know he wouldn’t let nothin’ like that ever happen to
me again…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Hey, that ain’t so bad now.</p>
<p><strong>large young cracker</strong>: When you gonna give me so o’
that!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Maybe when you grow up a little sonny.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: These aren’t Lucky Lager, I ordered Lucky
Lager.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sorry honey, ’ain’t nothin Lucky around
here.</p>
<p><strong>young cracker</strong>: What did you say to her city boy!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Nothing, I jus…</p>
<p><strong>young cracker</strong>: What’s a jism gargling cum drunk
fairy like you looking at a pretty girl like that for anyway?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You’d better hit him first Bri’, ‘cos it’s
comin’.</p>
<p><strong>young cracker</strong>: This yur’ boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Hit him.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Bri’ this shit ain’t Lucky Lager!</p>
<p><strong>young cracker</strong>: Hey Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: They don’t stock it here Early.</p>
<p><strong>young cracker</strong>: Why you fuckin’…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sorry about that, he’s always causing
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: These are on the house.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: My momma’s a beautician. Guess that’s where I
get it from. She wouldn’t hear of my moving in with Early… on account of
his just getting out of jail and all. Ain’t seen her in nearly a year
now. I wish she’d call me, just once.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What’s Early been in jail for?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Carryin’ a gun.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: An’ resistin’ arrest… At least that’s what
the Police said.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Jeez… Adele!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I’d better be goin’. It’s late.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Got to see a man about a mule.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Gotta take a piss.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Any reebs left in the back seat?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Aaahhhhh… That’s what we used to call a beer
when we was kids… Beer spelled backwards.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Last one.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …Well I probably drunk more than my share,
anyway… you go on an’ have it.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, it’s all yours. It’s on me… for saving my
ass back there.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Hey, that’s what buddies are for, right…?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You know those doors I was talking about?
Found two of them back in Kentucky. Shit, I wasn’t even looking for one
the first time. Me and the boys are just swingin’ our sickles by the
side of the road, and I turned around and there it was… this door with
this bright blinding white light all around it… course I’m thinkin’ I
must be sunstroked or somethin’… so I close my eyes figurin’ I’ll count
ten and it’ll be gone right… so I’m countin’… …1-2-3-4-5… an’ I’m ‘bout
ta piss myself right… -6-7-8-9… 10. An’ I open my eyes slow, spectin’ it
won’t be there right…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …and it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What were you “swinging a sickle” for?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: For… ’bout three years.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Gotta see a man about a mule… What’s
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: The same thing that’s been “wrong” the whole
trip. Your good buddy Early.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Who said he’s my good buddy?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You sure been acting like you were… …Out
whoopin’ it up, a drankin’ and ever’ thang.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey come on, you two were drinking too… so
what’s the big deal.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah, and you should’ve seen how terrified
she was that he’d find out. He beats her.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: She told me… …but only when she “deserves”
it. Did you know he was in jail?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …He told her it was for carrying a gun, but
the truth could be murder for all we know.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was
murder he’d still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn’t
be allowed to leave the state.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Maybe he wasn’t allowed to leave! Geezus
Brian!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Of course! The accent, the clothes, and those
table manners!… He’s got to be a mass murderer! What else could he
be?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You know, it wouldn’t even surprise me if he
turned out to be… a Republican!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Goddamnit!… my fucking toe!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Try not to lose consciousness ’til I get
back.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Ain’t you done enough drinking for
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Brian hurt his foot.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Sometimes… Don’t know why it is… I get so hot
I can’t stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like
that?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I can feel it start to run down my neck… …and
down my back… right into my pants.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …and everything starts stickin’ together…
keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin’ for my
boots, see who gets there first.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You never get that hot, huh?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I gotta get back before this ice melts.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …never?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No, never. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You like Skynard?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: My daddy always took sauerkraut juice and
tobasco sauce for a hangover, mixed in one egg not two, and some tomato
juice…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What! What!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Look again!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Only thing my old man ever gave me is that
goddamn .45.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Bri’, you’re jerkin’ it when you pull the
trigger, hold it real steady.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Boys’ll be boys.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You know any tricks?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You wanna learn some?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Steady… Breath in… now let half of it out,
and… fire.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Bri, I want you to keep this gun… consider it
a present. Never know, California could turn out to be a dangerous
place.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Tell ya Bri., I’m still a little sleepy,…
think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Siesta.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: A copy of a tape they found. He recorded
everything.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: hand held tape</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: When she was pissed at him, she’d beat the
shit out of him and lock him in here overnight…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …Eventually the boy wakes up one morning,
picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: There’s more…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look… I know you’re pissed off about the gun,
and I don’t blame you…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Brian, I’m not pissed off. God damm it, turn
that thing off.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m scared. A week ago you would never have
even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you’re out there
wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ’s sake! What’s
with you?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I
admit it, alright? But let’s not blow this. Not now… Let’s just get the
photos.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I can’t believe I agreed to do this.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh come on, don’t give me that shit… you
wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took
to get you up off your ass and on the way to California… There’s a big
difference.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Brian I want him out of our car!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Why, what did he do?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Brian get him out of the car. Next gas
station either he leaves or I do!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Twenty dollars in the tank and a carton of
cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>newsman</strong>: …the ex-mental patient with a history of
arrests is still at large…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Here’s your cigarettes…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: …And change. Better be careful, looks
like a bad one coming. Where you headin’?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Hear it never rains there. Must be
nice.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …we would like to repeat…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …there is a nationwide manhunt for…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …is believed responsible for the murders
of his landlord John Diebold…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …of the fatal stabbing and robbery of
Mr. Joseph Davies Robbins…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: If you see this man…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I ain’t ridin’ in no bus… bitch.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …call your local police or FBI…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You just sit there and keep your mouth
shut.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I knew that boy’d have a hogleg here
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Get over here.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Sit your ass down in that corner.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early, what’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I
don’t want him in here… Do it Adele… Now!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What’s your name, boy?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Walter Livesy.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Think. I might just have to kill you Walter.
How do you feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Not so good. You sure you have to?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I don’t know. Wish I did.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Early, just think…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Shut your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Adele, what are you doing back here?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …Lost my purse… Could you help me look for
it? It’s probably under the seat.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Where you from Walter?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Vernon, Florida.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Never heard of it, any huntin’?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Turkey mostly.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Turkey’s are real smart. Smarter than most
people think…</p>

You make sure you stay put for a while after we leave… Okay?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: …Mind if I hold that Bible?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What do you need a Bible for?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You think I’m goin’ to kill you. Well that’d
make me a liar then wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I wonder if Adele would like one of these?
Nah…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What the fuck!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Carrie, what’s wrong? Early, we went through
this already, you have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: ‘Fraid not Bri’… Drive Adele.</p>

<p><strong>adele</strong>: He did not, you liar. Take that back.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He’s a killer, Brian… He’s fucking
insane.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Everybody just shut up!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You two just cooperate and do what I say, and
we’ll all arrive safe and sound in California, as planned… unless, of
course, Adele don’t kill us first with her driving.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What the hell is this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: It’s Chinese food. It was the only place
open. You said you was starving, you’d eat anyth…</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Yeah but, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: I don’t know, they didn’t speak too good
English.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: And just what exactly are the Chinese doing
here in the middle of the American desert anyway?… Didja get the
beer?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …“Chink” beer!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Oh hell, I’m sorry Bri. Adele, honey, untie
Brian, he’s starving over there. Carrie, you want some?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Where’s the damn forks and spoons at!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …Is it just me, or has this whole trip been

<p><strong>early</strong>: No way. I guarantee you he was breathing when
I walked outta there.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Hey… Ain’t we getting near the next murder
site… Bri?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Forget about it, doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Hell it don’t… …Hand me Brian’s map there

<p><strong>early</strong>: Let’s have a look. You girls coming?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Can I just wait here?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Don’t worry Bri’, I’ll take the pictures.
…you stay here with Carrie. You run off… Bri’ pays the price. Karma,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: This is called walk the dog.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: So tell me… what happened here?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up
until a few years back.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: …and?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: They picked up hitchhikers… young men… and
brought them back here.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Where’d they do it?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Bri.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: This ain’t going to give me nightmares, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: This is one of my favorites… rock the
cradle.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …They asked them just before they were
executed why they did it. They said “to be famous.” Why do you do
it?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Do what Bri?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: We both know you didn’t have to kill that gas
station attendant.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You wanted to. Why?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: It make you feel good? Powerful? Superior,
what? Come on Early, tell me something. Were you angry?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Who are you angry with Early… your mother,
your father?</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: You want to know about my daddy, I’ll tell
you about my daddy, Bri…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Adele, listen to me… Early’s sick; he should
be in a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: The police are after him, he’s a
murderer!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: That’s not true!</p>
<p><strong>male officer</strong>: Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>female officer</strong>: I’ll call in the plate.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …I wouldn’t lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him
kill that man.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early didn’t kill nobody, he wouldn’t do
that. I don’t know why you’re saying those things. You ain’t my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Please don’t say anything Carrie.</p>
<p><strong>female officer</strong>: We got a match, I’ll call for back

<p><strong>male officer</strong>: All right ladies, I want both of you

<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, no, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: It’s the answer to all them questions of
yers.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Now you’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …Don’t do it. Early, look at him, look at his
face. That’s not your father.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I know that. That there is a policeman in a
world of pain. And this is what you call a mercy killin’.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I’m still waiting.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Not so much as a simple “thank you.”</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …thank you.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Thank you for what? What are you thanking me
for Adele?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Well Adele… it was for… …saving your fucking
life back there!</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: fingertips a fraction</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He wasn’t going to shoot her, you murdering
son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Carrie… stop it.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If
you’ll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes… you’ll see that he
is a homicidal fucking killer. He is… for real!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Shut up Carrie, please… just shut up!</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …I luv’ cactuses ’cos they’re so strong.
Don’t need much care really.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …You can forget about ‘em forever and then
look at ’em and they’re doin’ even better than before.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Adele… we gotta do something before Early
kills someone else.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: …There ain’t nothin’ can kill ’em. They can
live for two even three hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Adele for god sake please lis…</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: There ain’t nothing we could do. Once Early
sets his mind on somethin’, well thats the end of that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. musgrave</strong>: It’s just like in that dream I had.
If only I had seen their faces.</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: You’ve got beautiful cactuses here, I just
love ’em. My momma used to keep a garden.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Hey Bri… You ever stop to think that if you
switched the two letters in your name… …it would spell Brain.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: What’s wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: She had a dream that somethin’ like this was
gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: I’ll bet she did.</p>
<p><strong>early</strong>: Where’s your husband?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. musgrave</strong>: …I’m a widow.</p>

<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I tried talking to her at the mine. It
didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Then try again,</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early?</p>
<p><strong>adele</strong>: Early, Mrs. Musgrave has the most beautiful
little guest house out back and… well, no one’s stayin’ in it… it’s just
empty. And she said if me and you wanted to, well maybe we…</p>
