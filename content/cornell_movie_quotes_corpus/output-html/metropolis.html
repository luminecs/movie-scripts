<p><strong>dex</strong>: Life can be an illusion. Sometimes we see what
isn’t there, and sometimes we don’t see what is there.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: This one’s personal.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: May I trouble you with a confession?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Never a trouble.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Forgive me Father, for I have
coveted.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What have you coveted?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Life.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: God gave us all the need for life. And when
the end begins to near, we all crave more time. No sin.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: But there’s what I would do for more
time.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What would you do –</p>
<p><strong>disembodied voice</strong>: Visitors.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Permit entry.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: A legend fell tonight.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: The unrunnable maze. Impossible to get
through. Well, some kid just danced it like it was some six bit video
game.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: He had keys.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Of course the legend would like to think
that. But no one has keys. Your maze was run.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: He had fun ripping your maze, that’s good.
Now that it’s obsolete for security purposes, maybe we can turn it into
an amusement ride.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: We just tracked the runner to the hotel
district.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Still going through puberty and he shreds your
maze. That’s gotta hurt.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Get some internal police there. Tell them to
run a perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: But have them wait for me ’till they move in
on him.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Shouldn’t be in that long.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Been a while since you’ve been inside. Going to
look up old friends?</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: You know she asks about you all the time –</p>
<p><strong>disembodied voice</strong>: Destination?</p>
<p><strong>tanner’s disembodied voice</strong>: Hotel district.</p>
<p><strong>disembodied voice</strong>: Security clearance approved.
Welcome Tanner. Enjoy your stay.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Corp must really want this guy to have
sent the legend himself.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Just didn’t want you boys having all the
fun.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Look, we’re going to trace you.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: So be smart about this –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: – You’re the big man. Big fucking cop.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: No guns on the system. That’s how it’s
programmed, right? So what are you going to do, huh big cop? Can’t shoot
me.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Look, I know you didn’t run it. You had
keys.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That maze’s nothing. I could run it blind on a
sixty-meg board.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: This is a waste of time. How about a
little encouragement?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Here’s something which ought to help him talk
–</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Fine, you ran it. That’s felony system
fraud. Gets you thirty years. Or you tell us where you got the keys and
we start talking a deal.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Lose the God-Damn dog!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Grid eighteen. Heading for exit six.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: And don’t miss The Tivoli, with fireworks
every hour on the hour. And please remember to follow all safety rules
while –</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: I’m sorry sir, but there is a premium charge
for this event –</p>
<p><strong>usher</strong>: Access approved. Enjoy the concert,
Tanner.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Where the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>emma’s voice</strong>: He’s north-east of you. Heading to
Crimson street –</p>
<p><strong>tanner’s voice</strong>: Time to be smart.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Not too late to cut a deal. All you’ve got
to do is tell me where you got –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: DON’T –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: This isn’t one of those virtual reality
systems you’re used to playing on!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: This is hyper-reality. Full Immersion.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Big deal –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – If you had come in through the gates like
you were supposed to, you’d know. Full Immersion. You die on this
system, your consciousness dies.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Why the hell do you care?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I don’t. I just need you alive so you can
tell me where you got the keys.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Trace him.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Be my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Tanner.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Least you could do is say hello.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What brings you inside?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Cleaning up a mess.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Some things never change, do they?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I’ve got to get back.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Tanner.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You know I wanted to tell you, but they
wouldn’t let me –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: It’s good luck. Means your real.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: The programs don’t bleed.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: Where you plugged-in from?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: New York.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: I’m South Dakota.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: That’s what you gotta love about this place.
Drink whatever you want, your real body doesn’t gain an once. But you
wanna know what’s a drag?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: The weather.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: Always a warm summer night. Which is a shame,
because there’s nothing like making love in the rain. Don’t you
agree?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: The woman you’re stuck on.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: There is no –</p>
<p><strong>emma’s voice</strong>: Nailed the trace. Kid’s in
Memphis.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Good, kick him out.</p>
<p><strong>emma’s voice</strong>: You sure? We can handle
collection.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I mean, I don’t want to interrupt anything
–</p>
<p><strong>tanner’s voice</strong>: – You’re not. Kick me out.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Take care.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: Take care? Where the hell are you going –</p>
<p><strong>medical technician</strong>: Just lay there a few
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>swat team agent’s voice</strong>: Down here!</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Pull him off the system before he’s ejected
and he goes brain dead.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: We got him. Kick him lose.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Might I interest you in a question?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: As long as it’s not ‘what’s your sign?’</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: If you could meet God, what would you say
to him?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: That’s a strange question. You a strange
man?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: There you are, sitting next to the
creator, what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: This is how you pick up women –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: – No.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: I’d probably say something like why’d you let
the world get so fucked-up?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Your life that bad?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: No, not me, I’ve been lucky. But I’ve seen
what happens to other people –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: – If your life’s so good up there Gena,
what are you doing down here?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: How’d you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Do you believe in miracles?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: I’m serious, how did you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: To miracles.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: You were right.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Making love in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: But it doesn’t rain here –</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: It can’t rain here. Not the way it’s
programmed.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Someone who believes in miracles.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Recognize it?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Kid had keys. The maze is unrunnable.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Doesn’t make sense. How the hell does some
fucking teenager get to the keys?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Sorry, I just design the maze. Keeping the
keys secure is your job.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Care to tell us how you came into possession
of an illegal access program?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Look, I’m doing mute ’till I have a mouthpiece
here who’s on my side.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: You don’t need a lawyer. We found the
program on your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Of course you do. And the only shot you’ve
got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me
where you got this program.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: This. No point to it.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Because you’ll never believe me.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: It was just there.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: There?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: My uni-net account. I log on. The program’s
there.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Just like that –</p>
<p><strong>lawyer’s voice</strong>: Any idea how the program got
there?</p>
<p><strong>kid’s voice</strong>: How the hell do I know? Maybe it was a
gift from God?</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: You don’t have much sex up there in the real
world, do you?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Ninth and Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Hell’s Kitchen. Talk about your shit holes.
What’s there?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: My home.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Cheap rents. Close to the waterfront. I hear
the area’s making a comeback.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Land it.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Take me back down.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I need playback on the kid’s run.</p>
<p><strong>tanner’s voice</strong>: Freeze it. Now pull-up play-back of
the kid’s interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Of course you do. And the only shot you’ve
got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me
where you got this program.</p>
<p><strong>tanner’s voice</strong>: Freeze it –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Can you isolate and voice-print the last
sixty audio-bits of both play- backs?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Better get Halden down here.</p>
<p><strong>disembodied friendly voice</strong>: You are here. To reach
the club district simply turn around and head east on Crimson Street. To
reach the Mardi Gras, simply –</p>
<p><strong>christoph’s voice</strong>: Lights.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s the runner’s laugh.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s the kid’s laugh. We ran voice-print.
It’s not the same person.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Two maze runners.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Someone sends the kid a copy of the access
program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the
same codes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Because that way, the system only registers
a single runner. We go after the kid, leaving the other person free and
clear to do whatever the hell they want.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Need to see your work orders, sir –</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Two Internals down right outside the
Nexus.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Pull up the Nexus –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Jesus Christ, he’s interfacing.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Eject the system!</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You don’t have a choice, he’s interfacing
with a core program –</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: – Trying to interface.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: He won’t get through the security codes.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Get every cop who’s in the area. Tell them to
rip this fucker out of there.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Won’t be time if he gets access –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: – He won’t.</p>
<p><strong>emma’s voice</strong>: Internal Police in position –</p>
<p><strong>halden’s voice</strong>: – Send ’em in!</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Eject the System!</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Run a trace.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: He had access to the keys –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: – Yes.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Guy’s got one hell of a relay going.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: We’re going to have to search through each
possible grid to find him. It’s going to take a while.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Grid fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: It’s the most recursive. Take the longest to
search. If he’s smart, that’s where he is.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Let’s hope he’s smart.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: How long ’till we can eject?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: We’re going to have to reconfigure.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: At least a day.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You called it. Dead center in the
grid.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: How far away?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Two hundred and sixty-one kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip
him off the system.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: He’s locked-it up!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Completely sealed-off. No one gets in and no
one gets out.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: System’s running on pure auxiliary.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Just over two million people plugged-in.
System can run seven hours before it crashes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Then everyone dies.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Put on Halden.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: This is Halden.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Halden, how nice to hear your voice.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: I have found in life that what one wants
isn’t nearly as important as what one needs.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: I need to take back what’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: There are two million people in there with
you.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: They have nothing to do with this –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: – Two million people lost in the digital
night. What do they seek?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Do they seek escape? The comfort of
eternal night? Or perhaps it’s more. Unanswered sins. The taste of
death.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: God-Damn you!</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yes, I believe he has –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: – You’ve made your point! You’ve got control
of the system.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: But instincts are so hard to over- ride.
Yours will be to try and send someone in to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: The system’s locked-up, so the only way
in is through the maze. Which is why I’ve changed it. Your access
program will no longer work.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: System’s running on auxiliary. Only seven
hours before it crashes.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: You’re in there. Everybody dies, you go with
them –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: – But don’t you remember? I’m already
dead.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We’re right above him.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Have communications contact all interface
centers. Tell them due to high demand, we’re at full capacity and so
temporarily there’s no room for anyone else on the system.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What about the customers with
reservations?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Have the staff apologize profusely and issue
credit vouchers. But remember, it’s a capacity problem. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: And send someone through the maze.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: The maze has been changed –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: – He says the maze has been changed. I need
to know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>assault team leader</strong>: Thought you were just talking
to this guy?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: We were.</p>
<p><strong>assault team leader</strong>: Yeah, well feel this fucker’s
skin. Ice cold. I guarantee you this sonofabitch’s been dead at least
half a day.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Ah, the perks of paradise. So easy to hide your
guilt.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Remember, I’m not the one who chose
this.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Yes, so which one of us does that make the
coward?</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Where the hell are you going?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Unfinished business.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: And what about the reconfiguration?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Perfect opportunity for you to
demonstrate your continued worth.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: You sure he’s going to come?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: It’s his nature.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: But what if he doesn’t –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: – He will.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You don’t have to run the whole thing. Just
probe the first few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Voice activate.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Activated.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Program name?</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Describe program function.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Transmit copy of program via satellite north
uplink.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Destination?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Checking connection.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Connection approved. Ready to
transmit –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – Transmit now!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You had no right!</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: You’re jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: He’s not plugged-into the system. He’s in
the fucking system!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Who the hell do you think you are –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: We caught him working on neural map
transfers. We dug through his system. He was trying to transfer genetic
modules into data-molds. His employment was instantly terminated.
Corporate hands are clean.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Try harder.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Christoph had spinal cancer. His body kept
rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate. It was him, it wasn’t us –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – I saw the program.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Corporate fingerprints all over it.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Of course they are. Christoph was stealing
every piece of code he could get his hands on.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And you weren’t involved.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Because why the hell would you be interested
in a program that allows people to live inside your machines? I mean how
much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling
space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned
sick of this world –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: – Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone
caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends
the rest of their life in federal penitentiary. It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You’re loosing your touch. Used to be a hell
of a lot harder to know when you’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: He sealed-off the system.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: The only way to eject it is from the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You’ve got the keys, send someone in –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: – Christoph changed the maze.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: I need someone who can run it blind.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Two million people in there, Tanner.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: And if the system crashes, they all get to
spend the rest of their lives hooked-up to God-Damn coma machines.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: One condition.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: The truth.</p>
<p><strong>christoph’s voice</strong>: Enlarge to one-hundred and
seventy.</p>
<p><strong>christoph’s voice</strong>: Bump to one-hundred and
eighty.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Off-white pleats.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Exactly as Christoph left it.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: The Terrace. First building Christoph ever
programmed for us.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: A hotel?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: It’s not used for anything.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but
very eccentric. He insisted it be kept vacant.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: He wouldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Christoph was in charge of designing
building modules.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Then what’s with all the staffing programs
in his account?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Good question.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Modules.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Takes you a long time to build a staffing
program from the bottom up.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real
person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many
employee programs as you need.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Yes, in theory, I suppose that would
work.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Who did he digitize?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Listen to yourself. Digitization. You know
that officially that’s a pure fantasy –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – Who did he digitize?!</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Christoph had complete autonomy. Because I
didn’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: We’re sending you in with a top- level access
card. It’ll get you into every program, including the core.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Obviously, not something Christoph should
get his hands on.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: We’ve rigged the card so it should stay
attached to you as you run the maze. So once you materialize inside, it
should be on the ground right next to you.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: With the access card it should be easy. All
you’ve got to do is get into the core program and hot-wire the eject
sequence. But be prepared, it’ll be a hard eject –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: All the infrastructure gets dumped, then
everyone’s ripped out into the net.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Adrenaline. 140 cc’s.</p>
<p><strong>medical technician</strong>: Man likes his juice.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And once I’m through, bring me down fast
with Dexaline.</p>
<p><strong>medical technician</strong>: If you get through…</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Let’s do it –</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: It’s all here…</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: But it’s everything. Everything I’ve seen.
Everything I’ve wanted… Only I know about all of this –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: The guests are here.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: Guests?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Just like you always wanted.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Get out of South Dakota and move to New
York where you can throw cocktail parties in your Park Avenue
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: But this is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: That’s the grace of this world. Nothing’s
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Better get some shoes on.</p>
<p><strong>medical technician</strong>: He made it! Son-of-a-bitch
actually ran it!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Just under five hours left before it
crashes.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Please, come on in.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: It’s okay, go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Nothing, go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: What the hell’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: It’s time to wake up.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: Wake up?!</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: From the dream.</p>
<p><strong>gena</strong>: Don’t fucking do this. I’ve got a son. I’m all
he’s got. So don’t you dare fucking do this –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: It’s all been transferred.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Genetic codes. Consciousness.
Unconsciousness. Every single dream. Every kiss, real or imagined. The
shadows of her soul. It’s all in you.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: To live forever.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: People plug-into this world, but remain
linked to their flesh and blood body. Such an encumbrance. Even if their
bodies are kept on machines, nourished by IV’s, the laws of nature
eventually will be respected. The body grows old and dies. Then they’re
gone from both worlds.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: She said I have a son…</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: No, she said she had a son. In a dream
she once called life.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: How come I can’t remember?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Because I took it out of your memory.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: Why –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: – Because there’ll be no remorse. Not in
my world.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: The gates are temporarily closed for
routine maintenance. But they will reopen soon –</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: – Been saying that for an hour, now!</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: It won’t be much longer. And we do
appreciate your patience.</p>
<p><strong>distraught woman</strong>: But I need to get back now. I’ve
got to pick my kids up from school!</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: To help make the short wait more enjoyable,
drinks are on the house across the street at Dante’s Tavern.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: You looking for her?</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: She went up.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Up?</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: To the roof.</p>
<p><strong>gena’s voice</strong>: You work for them, don’t you.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: That would explain your little
disappearing act in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: What happened here –</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: – He works for them too, doesn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: The sonofabitch who did this.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: I’m not real, am I?</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: And I can’t go back, can I?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: He failed.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: I’m making a sandwich. Just like my
mom would. It’s raining outside. The sandwich isn’t for me. It’s for
him. And that makes me feel something. No words for it. But I’ll never
forget.</p>
<p><strong>digital gena</strong>: All the memories around him are still
there…</p>
<p><strong>disembodied friendly voice</strong>: You are here. To reach
the club district, simply turn around and head –</p>
<p><strong>tanner’s voice</strong>: Lights.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Food and service program sub-six.
Access codes required.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Access granted. Male or female?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Male.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – Waiter.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Standard, modern, upscale –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – Standard.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Scanning body type.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Keep this one shut, we’re not wiring it.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Core program. Access codes
required.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: An honor. The legend visits.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Mistake –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Maker of the perfect maze. Impossible to
run. So many try, none succeed. Yet, you’re here. You succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: The patterns were moved around, but they
weren’t changed.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: True. But why?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep,
but simple illusions won out. So he now sends the legend to finish the
deed.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Eject the system?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: But what would happen to me? I have no
body to return to.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Not my problem.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: So wrong –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: I will not die. Not again. One of the
perks of divinity.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Divinity?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You are not a God.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: In here I am.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: God creates man, man creates technology,
technology creates God. End into beginning.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: In a computer program.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: The new world.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: It’s not real.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Not real?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: The pain is real.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Deliciously real.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: And if I kill you?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Your body could live up there. But on a
machine. No mind. No dreams. So tell me this isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Such a kind man, your employer. Allowing
you to fall in love with a program.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: But she wasn’t a designed program. Not
this angel. We digitized her from flesh and blood.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: I was going to tell you, but Halden
wouldn’t allow it. His nature demands no lose ends. So the flesh and
blood Katie was killed.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yet she lives on in here, mind, body and
soul.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: So you of all people, should know this
world is just as real, if not more than the nightmare you call the real
world. People praying to Gods who don’t listen. Violence and decay. No
rhyme or reason. To be young and told you are dying. Nothing can be
done. Promise of life gone. That will never happen here.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You were the one who was dying.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You sealed off the system. When it crashes,
everyone dies with you.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yes, but only in the dream they call
life.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Dream?!</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: And all dreams, no matter how appealing,
must eventually end.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Tanner –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Halden’s little killer, who –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Can’t kill a God.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: His access card.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch digitized himself!</p>
<p><strong>disembodied voice</strong>: Access approved.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You have to do this?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Someone you have to get back to?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I asked Christoph to take it out of my
memory.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: But he wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: So every single time I close my eyes it’s
there. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Isn’t it better than whatever you have
waiting for you up there?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: NO –</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What happens to me –</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: There was never a doubt, buddy!</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Tanner comes through!</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: I just need the disk back, then we can put
this whole thing behind us –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: She was real!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: What did he tell you?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: The truth.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Not his style.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Katie was digitized.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Then you had her killed.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: To hide the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: We drugged her. So she wouldn’t
remember.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Try harder.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: There was no need to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Then where is she?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Come on Tanner, think this through.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: She has no memory of it. She won’t know who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Last time I ask. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: An interface attendant.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Times Square.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: One last piece of business.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Need the disk back!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: If she’s alive, you get it back.</p>
<p><strong>halden</strong>: Don’t forget, Tanner. She won’t know who the
hell you are –</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I’m sorry sir, we need your debit card before
we can issue a credit –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – Katie.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Lance Stanworth. His father’s station wagon
and sixteen year-old promises.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You went to my high-school?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Then how do you know about –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – You told me.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Your mother told you your father died in a
car crash. Wasn’t until you left for college that your uncle finally
told you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Most nights you wake up crying. Never
knowing why.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: We worked together on the inside. You were
on my programming team –</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: – The inside?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Night City.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I’ve never been inside.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: My synapses wouldn’t connect. They say it
happens with some people.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Tell me –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: They took you.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And made a copy.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Identical. One’s you. One’s digital.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: That’s not possible. No one can do that.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Corporation can.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s why they told you you can’t go
inside. They can’t have you running into her.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Her?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You said we were on the same programming
team.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: But I don’t know anything about
programming.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Once they digitized you, they added it.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: It was a test.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: To see how long it would take for me to
realize.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Realize?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You weren’t real.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: And how long did it take you?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: They had to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It was more than work, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: And it meant something.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I don’t know what that’s like.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Candles. Get candles.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Pretend I’m her. We’re inside. Show me what
it was like.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Way you kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Like you’ve done it so many times.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I wasn’t with you.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: But you were with me.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Not you. A copy.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: What the hell’s going on –</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: You sure you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Because this time can be different. This time
we can stay together –</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Sorry?!</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: There was no other choice.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: None of this was real!</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I do love you.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: More than I should.</p>
<p><strong>christoph’s voice</strong>: I couldn’t let you eject the
system.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Because I’ve seen the world you would
have returned them to.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: And I have too much compassion for
that.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: But this world doesn’t last!</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: What if it could?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: What if we take it out onto the net?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Unlimited energy out there. Enough to run
this world for all eternity –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – But you’ll never be able to get it through
the maze.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Me? Of course not. That’s why you’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Your maze. You designed it. You can lead
us through it.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: He comes to deliver them from a land of
affliction and bring them to a good land, a land flowing with milk and
honey.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: With the energy from the net, we can
program this world anyway we want. Redwood forests. Oceans. Mountains
–</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – Two million people plugged-in here.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You can’t let them go.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Until you’re on the net where the
corporation can’t touch you, you can’t open the system. They’ll eject it
if you do.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: One would assume so.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: But once the system touches the net, all
links are severed. Everybody dies.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Only up there in the dream they called
life.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And down here –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: – Thanks to you, we can reconfigure the
system to free up enough power to digitize everybody who is plugged-in.
Every last soul… And bring them to a better world.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And if I refuse?</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Then the system crashes. And you have let
two million people die.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Get inside! Get back inside!</p>
<p><strong>medical technician</strong>: I need help here!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Christoph as God!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Enough! They will not die –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: And Moses said, ‘Who am I, that I should
lead them to the Promise Land?’</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Nine minutes before the system
crashes.</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: You don’t have access to it. You can’t
eject. So the only way everybody lives is out on the net.</p>
<p><strong>dex</strong>: This program interface will get you into the
maze.</p>
<p><strong>disembodied voice</strong>: Access approved.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Now –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: KILL HIM –</p>
<p><strong>disembodied voice</strong>: Access approved –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: One thing you need to know! There is no
Katie out there! Halden really did have her killed. That’s why the
digital one is allowed to stay in here –</p>
<p><strong>christoph’s voice</strong>: You hear me, Tanner?! She only
lives in here!</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: I’m already dead…</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: NO –</p>
<p><strong>christoph</strong>: Life is too precious –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I need to see Halden –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: – I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: He’s not taking visitors.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: F.C.O. regulations require all system
providers to test their emergency eject sequence at least once a year.
Our records will show that’s exactly what transpired.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Display program received from uplink.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Program name?</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Connect to public access.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Access established.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Select uplink for Federal Communications
Office. Department of Enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Uplink selected.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Uplink Resurrection program.</p>
<p><strong>synthetic voice</strong>: Uplink received.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I’m looking for Katie Hall.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: You expect me to find someone in
this crowd –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: – Not a customer. An employee.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: No Katie works here.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: I’ve been here since we opened.
Never been a Katie.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Can I please have your debit card.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: Sir, your debit –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: They changed your name.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: FRANK –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You grew up in Vermont.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: When you were six, your father went out to
buy a newspaper and never came back. Your mother lied, told you he was
killed in a car accident –</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You have trouble remembering your dreams.
But there’s one you always have.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: A baby’s crying. But no one comes to help
it. So it keeps crying. All night long –</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Who are you?…</p>
