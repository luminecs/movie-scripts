<p><strong>2 int. back of russian car – night</strong>: On the back seat
is FRANKY FOUR -FINGERS, who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase
which is handcuffed to his wrist. He is flanked by TWO RUSSIAN HOODS.
This next section will be subtitled.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: How much further do we have to
go?</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: Pass him the money.</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: Franky you know you have no choice. So
please can we get on with it?</p>
<p><strong>2 continued:</strong>: Franky opens the package and he
reveals a stone the size of a fist. He shines a torch onto it and puts a
stone inspectin monocle to his eye. He’s satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: If you need a man in London then call this
number.</p>
<p><strong>. franky four fingers</strong>: Boris?</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: Boris, Boris can get you anything you
need.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s a bit heavy isn’t it Boris?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable. If it
doesn’t work you can hit him with it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes Gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous george</strong>: Sorry Tommy, I hope that I am not
interrupting.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh of course you’re not interrupting
Gorgeous, I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted you
to join us.</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous george</strong>: What are you doing Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I am baking a cake Gorgeous, not that i t ’ s
any of your business. Put the takings down, and be a good chap.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Is there anything else Gorgeous, a cup of tea
perhaps? No? Well in that could you kindly fuck off and shut the door
behind you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Not too bright but he hits like a train. OK I
’ l l take it. You’re a gambling man Boris, so I’ll toss you for it.
Heads it’s mine, tails I’ll give you twice the price.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: I ’ l l toss the coin.</p>
<p><strong>cut to :cu of spinning coin</strong>: Meet HANDS. On the
phone. Cool young street wise NY diamond dealer. He catches a coin.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Twenty carats?</p>
<p><strong>5 int. heathrow airport – day</strong>: Franky’s on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: Best stone I’ve seen in
years.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Good man Franky, you done a good job. What
time you back?</p>
<p><strong>frank y four fingers</strong>: I gotta move the smaller
stones here; it shouldn’t take me long. I ’ l l be a couple of days.</p>

<p><strong>boris</strong>: I’ l l see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: He can’t know that it’s you Boris. We do
too much business together. You’re gonna have to get someone else to hit
him and there is no way it can relate to us. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Yes I understand.</p>
<p><strong>russian</strong>: One more thing, he loves to gamble.</p>
<p><strong>7 ex.t. back alley makeshift boxing ring – day</strong>:
BRICK TOP is a heavy looking fella. He is observing a giant of a man,

<p><strong>gary</strong>: That’s what you deserve Mr Mclean.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Pull your tongue out of my arsehoie Gary.
Dogs do that, and you’re not a dog, are you Gary?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Err no, I am not.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: However, you do have all of the
characteristics of a dog Gary, all except loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: And people like dogs Gary, for the
principal reason that they’re loyal. So I don’t quite know where that
leaves you my old son, other than refuckinpugnant. . .</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Which one was it that kept the four grand
from the Clapham job?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Don’t let me ask again. I would like
answers, but I am not in the mood for asking questions, get busy lads,
or it’s feeding time, oink, oink, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: You know what to do with that don’t you

<p><strong>8 ext. another back alley makeshift boxing ring - -
day</strong>: …And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring.
Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy’s partner. Turkish is older and wiser than
Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through his paces. Gorgeous
George is head butting a heavy punch bag. The sound that emanates is
disturbing, and Tommy is distracted.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Is he allowed to do that?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: It’s an unlicensed boxing match Tommy, not
a tickling competition. These lads are out to hurt each other.</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous george</strong>: Oi Turkish, can I have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: What do I look like to you George, a fuckin
water boy?</p>

<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I want a new one Tommy and you ’re going to
buy it for me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s wrong with this one?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Oh nothing Tommy, it’s tip top, it’s just I
am not sure about the colour.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Here it’s all arranged. You just gotta pick
it up. Here’s an address.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I t ’ s that campsite.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: That’s right, you’re buying a caravan,
caravans live in campsites.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: They aren’t pikey are they?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I don’t know what they are, all I know is
they have a caravan, and we want a Caravan.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I hope they’re not pikies. I hate fucking
pikies.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You’re a sensitive boy, ain’t you Tommy?
You got ten grand and I want to see change.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Fuck me, hold tight, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s my Gucci belt, Turkish.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: No Tommy, there’s a gun in your trousers.
What is a gun doing in your trousers?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s for protection.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Protection from what, the Germans? The war
ended fifty years ago. Err what’s to stop it blowing your balls off
every time you sit down? Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Boris the Blade.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You mean Boris the sneaky fucking
Russian.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I t ’ s a bit heavy isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: The weight is a sign of reliability. I always
go for reliability.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: I ’ l l take it. How much do
you want for -it?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: Ok, so what do you want for
it?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: I want you to do something for me .</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: There is a fight in a couple of days:</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: What kind of a fight?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Unlicensed boxing.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: There is a bookies I know that will take
bets. If you place one down for me we will call it quits.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: Why don’t you put it down
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Well there isn’t too many bookies that take
those kind of bets, and I already have an outstanding debt with the
house. I know something most don’t. Why don’t you put a few pounds down
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: What do you mean? �</p>
<p><strong>10 int. new york office –day</strong>: On the phone.</p>

<p><strong>kid 2</strong>: He’s a big man that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Would you look at the size of his muscles?
And then look at the size of his fists. Hey Mum, come and look at the

<p><strong>micky</strong>: Would you look at the strength of the man? I

<p><strong>15 int. tyrone’s car</strong>: We open on Vinny’s dog, now
sitting in a car, it’s breathing heavily and doesn’t look well, and Sol
doesn’t see the funny side of the dog sitting next to him. The man
driving is called TYRONE: he’s a white guy who thinks he’s black. Vin is
also in the car.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: I don’t want him dribbling on my , seats
man.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Give him another of those biscuits. They shut
him up.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: They give him wind.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Hey watch the road! Fuck me, you want this
man to drive us Sol? Can you drive mate?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: No Vin, he can’t tell the difference between a
steering wheel and a man</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Don’t you worry about me, jus worry about
the dog on my seats man!</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Sol why’s he talking like a black man?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I don’t know Vin. Oi Tyrone, Vin wants to know
why you talk like a black man?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Roots and ting, seen?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Roots and what?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I don’t know. You get that gun from Boris?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Got it. It wasn’t exactly what I was
expecting, mind. Mean looking bastard though, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: It’s a shotgun Sol.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I t ’ s a fuckin anti-aircraft gun Vin. What
are you planning on shooting, the angels out of the clouds? That’s gonna
raise more than pulses.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: It will raise hell my old son.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I don’t think I really want to see gun?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: The are psychological advantages to a gun
that looks like it can perforate the moon.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Can you get this fuckin dog to stop dribbling
on me?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk about
overkill. One look at a crack desperate brother and you could wave a
knife and fork around, and I am sure they would lick the salt of your
scrotum.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: I never do a job unless I have a clean car,
I like to make my wheels look crisp.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Are you serious,? You’ re a getaway driver,
you’re not here to show your fuckin car off. ��.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: He’s a good dog. He’ll get a little homesick
for a while but he’11 get over it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t know what all your fuss was about.
They aren’t bad fellas.</p>
<p><strong>. gorgeous george</strong>: I don’t think it’s supposed to
have done that.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: The deal was you bought it how you saw
it.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Look, I have helped ya as much as I am gonna
help ya. You still got a car and I suggest you use it before you’re not
welcome anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous george</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: It was only a question of time before you got
some attention. Nobody brings a fella the size of you unless they are
trying to say something without talking.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Just give us my money and you can keep your
caravan.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Why the fuck do I want a caravan that’s got
no fuckin wheels? I am not going to do that.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Where the fuck do you think you’re going? You
want to settle this with a fight?</p>
<p><strong>mum</strong>: You’ll do no such thing Michael. You’ll…</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Alright Mum, we shan’t, we’ll settle it some
other way, now don’t get upset.</p>
<p><strong>mum</strong>: I won’t have you fighting, Micky.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Okay mum okay. You need to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Darren look after Mum. Get her sitting
down.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: I ’ l l fight you for it.</p>
<p><strong>20 int. horse box, pikey camp – day</strong>: The two
fighters start pacing. It looks a bit ridiculous, Micky is dwarfed by
comparison. Gorgeous George takes a swipe: it was an .impressive punch,
but Micky is a quick littl bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to
retaliate; his hands are still by his,side.</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous george</strong>: You want to stay down my friend, I
promise you, you want to stay down.</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous george</strong>: Now you fucking stay down boy or
you won’t be coming up next time.</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous george</strong>: This is sick. I am outta here.</p>
<p><strong>micky -</strong>: You’re not going anywhere my friend. You
stay until the job is done.</p>
<p><strong>cut to black</strong>: FADE IN: We see Gorgeous George lying
on the floor with a head the size of a water melon. There is blood
streaming out of every orifice in his head - he’s in.big trouble. We are
in slow motion;- there’s a lot of activity going on around the body on
the floor, their mouths are open but we can’t hear what they are saying,
all we can hear is the voice over given by Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This isn’t good, if George doesn’t wake up in
the next few minutes I</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: have a problem. I am scared, really fuckin
scared. There is something coldblooded and practical about what these
people are thinking. They will pop me like a hot sausage if George
doesn’t wake up. Why do they want to go to the trouble of explaining why
a man died in a campsite? These people don’t exist in society, you can’t
find them, they live under their own laws and ignore everybody else’s. I
am scared, I am really fuckin scared.</p>
<p><strong>21 int. amusement arcade 1 – day</strong>: We see Turkish
with a somewhat serious expression on his face he has his customary pint
of milk on one side, he takes a sip and “ohhhs” and “arrrs” for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>.turkish</strong>: So you’re telling me he would have run you
through if Gorgeous hadn’t woken up?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, his Mum stopped it. If his Mum hadn’t
turned up, well, I ’ d be pikey fuckin sausages.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: What were you thinking of? Why the fuck did
you put Gorgeous George into a bare knuckle boxing match two days before
he had to fight the Bomber?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He was half his size.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I didn’t expect him to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You put the man into a bare knuckle boxing
match.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: What the fuck did you expect? A grease down
and a shiatsu?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who took the jam out of your donut?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You took the fuckin jam out of my donut
Tommy, you did.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You said get a good deal so…</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Tell me the correlation between a
hospitalized boxer and a good deal?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: How are we going to explain to Brick Top
that his fight isn’t going to . happen?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We replace the fighter.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Oh what, and hope he doesn’t notice? And
who the fuck are we going to replace him with?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: John “The Gun?” Or “Mad Fist” Willy?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You’re not exactly Mr Current Affairs, are
you Tommy? Mad Fist went mad, and the “Gun” shot himself.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What about Clam Hand Tony?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Got his fingers caught in the till. He’s no
good to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: A bare .knuckle boxer isn’t a lot of good
without any fuckin knuckles, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Let’s use the fuckin pikey.</p>
<p><strong>22 int. doug’s office – day</strong>: Doug the Head and
Franky Four Fingers are doing a deal. Doug has a case open and is
admiring a couple of stones.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: From Russia with love. You
interested? .</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I told you I was interested.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: I got stones to sell, fat to
chew and many different men to see about many different dogs, so if I am
not rushing you, could you spit shine the top of your smoothie and move
a little faster?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hold tight Franky, when in Rome.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: I am not in Rome Doug, I am in
a rush.</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: I gotta make the bookies.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Bookies? What you betting on?</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: Some guy called Bomber
Harris.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The unlicensed boxer? You know something I
don’t?</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You get busy Franky. Put a couple of hundred
down for me.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: How much you going to pay us?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ten k.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: I lose more than that running for the bus. I
’ l l do it for a caravan.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: No a caravan.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>m icky</strong>: You are sitting in one if that makes things
easier. I want a top caravan.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It was us that wanted a caravan.- Anyway
what’s wrong with this one?</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: It’s not for me, it ’ s for me Mum.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. doug’s office – morning</strong>: Doug is on the
phone to Hands.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I overpaid Hands, I want you to recognize
charity when i t ’ s offered.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Do shut up, where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I don’t know Hands, I ’ m not his mother. But
I am seeing him later.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: He wants cash so he’s coming back after he has
been to a fight.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: What do you mean a fight, you mean a boxing
match? Is there gambling involved?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I t ’ s a boxing match Hands.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Did he have a case with him?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: And he’s gone gambling? That’s Franky “I have
a problem with gambling” fuckin Four Fingers, you are talking about
Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What am I, telepathic?</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Franky is good at buying stones Doug but he’s
a fuckin liability when it comes to gambling. That has cost me. So in
turn rit’ s cost him. He gets distracted and chopping off a digit seems
to focus his attention.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How much can he lose?</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: I ’ l l not forgive you Doug, I am coming
over, get me that car.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: We are here to see Brick Top.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: I am very busy at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>turkish �</strong>: I am not asking you to break sweat,</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Brick Top.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>. … : turkish :</strong>: Well make a call and see if someone
else has. Say it’s Turkish.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You know what he’s done to people on that
pool table?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What, potted more balls than any other
player? What else can you do to people on a pool table?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Quite a fuckin lot if you nail ’em to
it.</p>
<p><strong>heavy fella</strong>: You Turkish?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Yup. -</p>
<p><strong>heavy fella</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: They can charm the paint off walls these
fellas.</p>
<p><strong>27 int. back of pub - dog fight – night</strong>: A circle of
blunt faces are exchanging money with one another A few faces turn round
to examine Tommy and Turkish, they frown slightly but carry on about
their business once they see they are accompanied by the muscle. The
heavy walks over to Brick Top. The heavy taps him on the shoulder and
whispers. He acknowledges, and gives his drink to the heavy. He walks
over. There is a cage next to Brick Top which has a pit bull in, and
Brick Top who is carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors. The
dog snarls back.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Look mean now you hairy fucker won’t
ya?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Shits itself when you put it in the ring,
but poke .it with a stick and watch his bollocks grow. You like a dog
fight, Turkish?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I like my dog to growl at the post man.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Gorgeous ready for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: We don’c have a Gorgeous anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: You’re going to have to repeat that.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: We have lost Gorgeous George.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: I said keep the noise down.. . .</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Well, where did you lose him? He isn’t a
set of fuckin car keys is he? And it’s not as though he is
inconfuckinspicuous is it?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I am not backing out.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: You can bet your bollocks to a barn dance
you’re not backing out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We are changing the fighter.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Oh fuck me your lady friend has got a
voice. And who might you be changing him to, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You won’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Are you taking the piss?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: No, there was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: I’ll show you a fuckin accident.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You’ve still got your fight.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: No, I lose all bets at the bookies. You
can’t change fighters at the last minute, so no, I don’t have my fight
do I, you fuckin prat!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You could take bets at the fight.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Put a lead on her Turkish, Before she
gets bitten.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Make sure your man goes down in the
fourth. You’re on thin fuckin ice my pedigree chums and I’ll be there if
it breaks.</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. bookies</strong>: The black guys pull up in’Tyrone’s
car outside the bookies Vin is playing with the dog in the back.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I am not happy about that dog Vin, you can’t
bring a dog on a job.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: You can’t leave him on his own, not to begin
with, he gets homesick.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Homesick, for fucks sake.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: He does. If he gets the chance he runs back
to the gypsies’ campsite.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Ohh shut up, how can he find it?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I don’t know Sol, I am not a dog. Ask him.
It’ s like he’s got a fuckin homing beacon. Give him the chance and he’s
off.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You’re going soft Vin? Here pass me a
sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Jessssus, he didn’t even chew it.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: What have you stopped here for? What’s wrong
with that space?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: It’s too tight.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: What are you talking about, tight? You could
land a jumbo fuckin jet in there.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Leave him alone, he’s a natural.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: A natural fuckin idiot. Tyrone, what have you
done?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Look, you hassle me, see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Well don’t move it now, otherwise people will
see the damage. What did you do that for? ^</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: I didn’t see it there.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Eh? It’s a four ton truck. It’ s not as
though i t ’ s a ferret fuckin a flea is it?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: It was at a funny angle.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Funny angle? It was behind you Tyrone,
whenever you reverse things come from behind you. I am not happy
Sol.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Give him something to shut him up.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: He can’t swallow a whole ball.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: He swallowed it.</p>
<p><strong>29 ext. airport. –</strong>: Doug and Alex are waiting to
pick- up Hands.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Did you get Hands that car?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I got him one like it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What do you mean one like it?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I got him the Volante.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What did I say? What exactly did I say?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You said get him the Vantage.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s right, I clearly said get him the
Vantage. So why did you get the Volante? ;</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Because they look the same.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The Septuagint scholars mistranslated the
Hebrew word for “young woman” in to the Greek word for “virgin”, because
they thought they looked the same, coming up with the prophecy “behold a
virgin shall conceive and bear a son”. But there is a world of
difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a
Volante and a fuckin Vantage.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Are you saying that the fact that your cousin
Hands is driving a Valiant instead of a Vantage is a profound a mistake
as a whole religion?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes I fuckin am!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Cars are his religion. He can drive a Valiant
in the States but I can’t drive a Vantage because they won’t tolerate
the emissions. Well, it’s too late now, that’s Concorde.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How about a hug for your old cousin Doug?</p>
<p><strong>� hands</strong>: Fuck off you fat bald bastard - and where’s
my car?</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. bookies</strong>: The black guys are sitting in the
car still. The occasional squeak comes from the dog.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: How am I going to get it out?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: He’ll probably cough it up.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Do you think he’ll be alright?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Hope not.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What are we waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: We are waiting for a man carrying a case.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Because the deal is that we give the Russian
the case and we keep the money.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What’s in the case?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Fuckin ’ell Tyrone you ask a lot of questions.
You concentrate on the driving okay?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Shit, was that him?</p>
<p><strong>.’ vinny</strong>: Don’t ask me, you’re the one supposed to
keep an eye on it. How many fingers did he have?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Are you serious? I am sorry but I couldn’t get
the binoculars out in time.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Well let’s not stand on ceremony, let’s start
the show.</p>
<p><strong>32 int. bookies – day</strong>: Inside is the MAN with the
case, busy filling in a slip, and TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter.
Vinny doesn’t mince around and goes straight to the counter, where the
HEAD CLERK PAULINE, comes up to help.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Yes sir, how can I help?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: You can start by giving me all your
money.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Does Sir know who this bookies belongs
to?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: It. belongs to me now.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: If you know what’s good for…</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Vi nce ? Vince??</p>
<p><strong>sol .</strong>: What are you doing Vince? And what the fuck
are you doing up there?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I have got your man out here. If you don’t put
down the screen I’ll blow his fucking head off! You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I don’t care, you can do what you like he’s
not related to me.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You think you can try me?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Drop the screen now! You just seen what it did
to this wall so think what it could do to you.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: . Do it. . . . I said do it.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: How you doing Vince?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: How do I look like I am doing you fucking
idiot? I would be doing a lot better if you would stop using my
name.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Now fill this bag. . . ’ . - . -</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: All bets are off.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I am not here to make a fuckin bet.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: All bets are off.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Are you fuckin stupid? I don’t care if the
fuckin bets are off. I want…</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: If all bets are off then there can’t be any
money, can there?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I ain’t buying that.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I ain’t fuckin selling it, it’s a fact! .
’’.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Well, what have you got?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Nothing, I mean we got a few coins but no
notes.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Can we just get out of here please. I am not
feeling too funny.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Well I am not feeling too fucking funny myself,
let me tell you!</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Let me see your hands.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Copper coins? What do you mean copper fuckin
coins?</p>
<p><strong>vinny .</strong>: Get me out of here now Sol.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: We’re going Vin.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: No security, eh?</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: What the fuck are you two doing?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Tyrone get us outta here.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I said, get us outta here Tyrone!</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: …-.! gotta say it’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Caesar’s Palace?</p>
<p><strong>36 int. caesars palace streatham</strong>: Doug approaches
the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Private night tonight chaps.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Jesus are we ever going to get in there?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You gotta understand that this isn’t exactly
Vegas and it’s not exactly legal.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: I am not looking for Vegas, Doug, I am
looking for Franky Four Fingers.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well he said he was going to be here.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: If there’s gambling involved, he’ll be
here.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Hello, who’s your man?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Horrible bastard, it’s his fight, made all his
money in.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Original.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So he doesn’t need to do this, but he’s got
dark taste for fights and blood, he wants to impress London’s criminal
royalty..</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: ..with a tip on when who hits the floor. Any
man with veins in his brains knows Brick Top knows the answer.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Those boys make Brick top look like a skirt
clinging thumb sucker. And i f y o u p l a y wi t h f i r e . . . �</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: So Michael, you got it clear? It’s the
fourth round. I’ll tap you anyway to let you know when to go down.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Just make sure the man doesn’t kill me before
the fuckin fourth.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: As long as we keep them happy.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Make sure they are kept sweet. The last
thing I want is them fuckin moaning.</p>
<p><strong>ref .’�</strong>: In the blue corner I have the young and
only unchallenged cutthroat of calamity, meaner than Beelzebub’s
conscience cleaner. Give it up for the bone crunching one punch machine
gun – Micky.</p>
<p><strong>r ef</strong>: And in the other corner a man that needs no
introduction to destruction, the solo warrior of Walthamstow, sometimes
known as Buckshot Peter, or sometimes known as the dictator . to the
devastator, he put the ’ e ’ in eradicate, the ’ o ’ in obliterate and
the ’ a 1 in annihilate, you know this monster of a monster, the
sinister prime minister.. . . “Bomber the”mad man” Harris”!</p>
<p><strong>r ef</strong>: Now I want a good dirty fight lads, So now
it’s that time again.. . . Let’s. . . . Get ready to
rrrrrrummmmmble.</p>
<p><strong>37 continued:</strong>: It hits Bomber Harris square on the
jaw this has the effect of forcing blood out of his ears the man is
positively out cold. We crashtrack into various characters’ reactions:
Brick Top, Turkish and Tommy etc. All are in shock. The ref tries to
resuscitate Harris/ but it’s not happening, he catches a look of
desperation from one of the villains and is eventually left with little
choice but to hold Micky’s hand up. We cut to the nasty looking
characters that we saw before they have approached with their heavies,
and they are obviously not satisfied. .</p>
<p><strong>salt peter</strong>: Tha-nks for the tip, Brick top.</p>
<p><strong>jack the all seeing eye</strong>: I have just said goodbye to
forty large because of you, what’s the crack?</p>
<p>****: the first half of this scene happens about midway scene We cut
back to Frankie Four Fingers getting out of his van. He takes a quick
look around and enters the back of his van. There he raises the spare
tire and picks up his gun, he examines it and places it in his trouser
front. He then turns to exit. At which point there is a loud smash and
Franky is knocked backwards .</p>
<p><strong>we fade up</strong>: Frankie wakes up. He has a trickle of
blood dripping down the back of his neck, he looks at his watch and
panics. He kicks the doors a couple of times - nothing happens, but on
the third kick the doors spring open. Franky brushes himself off and
makes his way to the bookies.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. pawn brokers – day</strong>: We cut to the black guys
trying to open the case. They have Franky’s hand up on a desk and are
fiddling with the handcuff, whatever they are trying to break in with
snaps off. Vinny is frustrated and illustrates his dissatisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Where ’ s the Russian?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: He should be here in a minute. Well get him
to open it.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Oi, you, Four Fingers, how are we going to
get into your case?</p>
<p><strong>franky three fingers</strong>: If you take the tape off my
eyes � I Ml tell you.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What do you need the tape off your eyes for?
You talk out of them?</p>
<p><strong>� vinny</strong>: Just tell us the combination.</p>
<p><strong>franky three fingers</strong>: I can’t remember the
combination I can only do it if I see it .</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: You look at us and it’s good night.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: And here’s the money.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I don’t believe this. Why are you carrying
round a case with this little in it? . .</p>
<p><strong>franky four fingers</strong>: Now be a bunch of good fellas
and lie down on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Hello what have we got here?</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. pawn brokers</strong>: Boris is admiring the outside
of the shop. He walks in.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. pawn brokers</strong>: Franky is tied up on a stool,
in front of him is the case and it’s open. Boris waves the black guys to
come into the corridor so they can talk without being heard.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: What are you doing with him?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: The case was attached to his body.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: So why didn’t you chop it off?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Err, because we didn’t. Now Boris we have or
rather you have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>. sol</strong>: There wasn’t any money there. v</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: There’s ten grand.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Keep it. We want this, or at least half of
this.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: What was in the case was mine, what was in
the bookies was yours, ok there wasn’t much but, here’s ten large to
help the situation.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I am afraid it’s too late for that Boris.
-</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: We want half and that’s because we are being
generous. We could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: You fuckin idiots. He couldn’t know who I am.
Now open the case and give me.the stone.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Who’s next? You have the ten grand now give
me the stone.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: The only man that knows the combination you
just shot.</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: He’s your problem now. You can keep the” ten
grand along with the body, but if I see you again…well look at him.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I ain’t going in the front.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t think it’s a good idea you going in
at all.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Unless you are going to transcendentally

<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Go down-boy, go down.</p>
<p><strong>47 continued:</strong>: Tony keeps going for him. Charlie
raises the gun and points it at Tony’s face and fires the last shot. The
bullet goes straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it
exits his cheek. Tony is standing there with six. bullet holes in him
and bleeding all over the carpet. As he talks blood courses its way down
his front and a strong lisp is frustrating the words.</p>

man that can.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tony. Bullet Tooth Tony. He’ll find Franky for
you.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>susi</strong>: �What is he?’ Would be a more appropriate
question.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: He’s the best chance you have of finding
Franky.</p>
<p><strong>susi</strong>: He has upset every bad boy in town, at some
point, or another but nobody’s got the nuts to knock him off because
they aren’t sure whether you can kill the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: You really think he can find him?</p>
<p><strong>susi</strong>: He’ll find you Moses and the burning bush if
you pay him to.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Ok so let’s get hold of him.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Firstly you gotta understand he’s a little
strange. .</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: .He could swing from trees wearing rubber
dresses as far as I am concerned, all as I care about is whether he can
find Franky.</p>

<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Why didn’t you “bus a cap in his ass” then
Tommy? Mind you, you would do more damage if you threw it at him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You saying I can’t shoot?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Oh no Tommy I wasn’t saying you can’t
shoot, I know you can’t shoot. What I was saying is that six pound piece
of shit stuck in your trousers there would do more damage if you fed it

<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Are you saying it doesn’t work?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You tried it?</p>

<p><strong>sol</strong>: Sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>bad boy lincoln</strong>: The only way to sort it out is to
bring him back to life and I am not a fuckin witch doctor am I?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Villains are supposed to know how to get rid of
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>bad boy lincoln</strong>: Err, yes, but I have never actually
got rid of one. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: He’s a man with a hole in his face Lincoln. Who
cares who he is?</p>
<p><strong>bad boy lincoln</strong>: Err well, let’s wrap him up.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What do you want to do that for? , He’s not a
fuckin Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. car</strong>: Brick Top is on the phone and Errol and
John sit opposite.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Like I said I wasn’t giving you a choice.
I am telling you that fuckin gypsy has got to fight.</p>
<p><strong>70 int. amusement arcade</strong>: Turkish is on the other
end of the phone to Brick Top. Tommy is trying to listen in to what is
being said.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I am sorry, but he’s a stubborn bastard, he
says he’s had enough, he says he’s got to look after his old mum.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: His what? �.-� . ..</p>
<p><strong>turkish ’</strong>: His mum.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Are’ you taking the piss again?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: That’s what he said, she’s a nice old girl
his mum.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: You’re on thin ice Turkish, and I am

pikey being difficult. Hello, we here?</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. pawn brokers</strong>: We see Errol outside with a
glass cutter. He puts it around the door and creates a circle with the
sharp side, pulls it out and puts his hand through to kill the alarm.
He’s in.</p>
<p><strong>- errol</strong>: You coming John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is a trout’s head water proof Errol? I
wouldn’t miss it for the world.</p>
<p><strong>errol</strong>: Get the governor John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It looks like we are in gov.</p>

<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>bad boy lincoln</strong>: Yeah I know.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Good. That will save me some time
then.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Well I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: What you gonna do with your man there?
You’re always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece.
Apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and
pile it all together.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Would someone mind telling me who you are?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: After you got six pieces you gotta get
rid of ’em, of course you can’t just leave it in the deep freeze for
your mum to discover, can ya?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Lincoln, who is this man?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: And then I hear the best thing to do is
feed ’em to pigs. You gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the
sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk. You gotta shave
the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that
after of course, but you don’t want to go sieving pig shit do you? Ever
seen the size of one of their molars? �</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: They go through bone like i t ’ s butter.
You gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go
through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes
that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh
every minute,. . .</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Hence the expression greedy as a pig.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Well thank you, that’s a large weight off my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: But would you mind very much telling me who
the’ fuck you are? Other than a man that feeds people to pigs of
course.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Would you look at the size of this?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Golly that is big isn’t it Errol?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Do you know what Nemesis means?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: A righteous infliction of retribution
�by. an appropriate agent, personified in this case by a horrible cunt.

<p><strong>brick top</strong>: What do you think Errol?</p>
<p><strong>errol.</strong>: I think we should drip dry em governor,

<p><strong>74 continued:</strong>: Brick Top again frowns at Errol.</p>

me.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: He set the dogs on me. Look.</p>

want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: First things first, one of us, Tyrone, you get
round to-the Russian’s. The second you see him call us.</p>

substantial, don’t turn up with a frown and a wagging finger.</p>

<p><strong>btt</strong>: Someone whom you might shortly meet.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You threatening me?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Only with wings and a halo.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Clean the breakfast7off your top lip/ and make

<p><strong>� mullet</strong>: I don’t know anything about that</p>

<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s not in synch with evolution.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>t ommy</strong>: Cows have only been domesticated in the last
eight thousand years, before that they were running around mad as
lorries. The human digestive system ‘“’ hasn’t got used to any dairy
products yet, it takes a lot longer than that.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Well fuck me Tommy, what have you been

<p><strong>btt</strong>: You want to kill him or not?</p>

<p><strong>btt</strong>: You, you want a knife?</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: I wouldn’t know what to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: It’s not a fuckin rocket launcher. It’s a knife

<p><strong>vinny</strong>: You idiot what have you done?</p>

Let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: What about Rose Bud?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Well you can bring him with you if you want but
which bit do you want to bring?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: They are getting out.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Well get down, the last thing we want him to
see is three brothers wearing ski masks.</p>
<p><strong>1.01 int. cafe</strong>: BTT and Hands, covered in blood,
walk off the street into a cafe.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: I gotta clean up.</p>
<p><strong>102 ext. street</strong>: The black guys pile out of the car
and follow BTT and Hands at a safe distance.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. cafe</strong>: BTT is on the phone</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Doug, we are in the shit, come and pick us
up.</p>
<p><strong>104 ext. boris1 house</strong>: Tommy and Turkish pull up
outside Boris’ house.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: He’s left the door open.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I shouldn’t think that’s a good idea. Shall
we have a look?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I don’t want to go in there, he’s a
dangerous bastard, taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of Russian
disputations, he’s got as many of these nuts as those nuts.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t care if he’s got fuckin hazel nuts, I
want a gun that works.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Well come on then before the Germans get
here.</p>
<p><strong>105 ext. cafe . .</strong>: The black guys have followed BTT
and Hands and are waiting outside, readying themselves for action. .</p>
<p><strong>sol ’ .</strong>: . Now Tyrone you go… Tyrone, oi</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I’11 never forgive you Sol.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: When we get in you wait by the door I am number
one, Vin number two and you are number three.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. cafe</strong>: The black guys enter. BTT has just
finished his phone call and sat down. . -.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I don’t want a fuss and I don’t want to put a
bullet in your face, but unless you give me exactly what I want there
will be murders.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Number three pull the blind down.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: lo number three, he said pull the blind
down.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I’ll sort it. .</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Stand up!</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Excuse me, but who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You hear what .1 said? Stand up, unless you’re
crippled.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Do I look crippled? ,</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You’ll look fucking dead, unless you stand
up.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: You got ballsl</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You want to test em?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: There are two types of balls, there are big
brave balls and there are little mincy faggot balls.</p>
<p><strong>btt .</strong>: So you’re obviously the big dick, and they on
either side of you, must be your balls.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Let go of the gun.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: I am talking for your benefit. Now dicks have
drive, and clarity of vision.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: But they’re not clever, they smell pussy, and
they want a piece of the action, and the dimmer the dick, the less he
cares about the consequences, and you thought you smelt gooood ol pussy,
and have brought your little mincy faggot balls along for a gooood ol
time, but you have got your parties muddled up, there is no pussy here,
just a dose to make you wish you were born a woman.. . .</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: And just like a prick, you are having second
thoughts; you’re shrinking, and your little balls are shrinking with
you.</p>
<p><strong>107 int. corridor – continuous</strong>: …and just as they
turn the corner they bump into Hands still drying his hands, they can
see that he’s carrying a case that they recognize. The brothers adapt to
their new scenario:</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Pass it me.</p>
<p><strong>.-.’-.. vinny</strong>: I won’t ask again</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Quite a lump. Alright you can go ’ now .
’</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Any chance of taking Lincoln with us?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: That’s where Errol’s taking ya.</p>
<p><strong>errol</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You alright Lincoln?</p>
<p><strong>errol</strong>: Do you know why the governor is the
governor?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Err. .</p>
<p><strong>errol</strong>: I t ’s because people are scared of him. You
know why they are scared of him?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Err .</p>
<p><strong>errol</strong>: It’s because of stories. I am sure you’ve
heard one or two of those stories. For example, did you hear about the
three black fellas that did a very bad thing, however they made some
effort to redeem that very bad thing, so the governor saw fit not to
kill em. He thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them
kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale. That way
everybody wins, well, all except the two that died of course.</p>
<p><strong>bad boy lincoln ,</strong>: Grab it.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: The gun you prick.</p>
<p><strong>113 int. doug’s office ’</strong>: All three black guys are
sitting in front of BTT and Hands and Doug. There is silence as the
white guys have just been told something disturbing. BTT eventually
breaks the silence</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Well you gotta admire their balls.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: _ I don’t want to admire balls that I want to
chop off.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What choice did we have?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I know sorry doesn’t mean fuck all, but we
are game on, what do you want us to do?</p>
<p><strong>�hands</strong>: Get us that stone back.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: So Brick Top has now got the stone?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: He’s got it.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: You wouldn’t be lying to us would you
now?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Why should we? Could just have disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You got some front coming round here ain’t
ya Tony?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Never mind what I got , I am looking for Brick
Top?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You mean Mr Mclean.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: You know who I mean you fucking fringe now find
him.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Chop chop.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: What was it you did exactly Tony?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: I had a little run in with a few of the
chaps.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: How ’ s that ?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: They’re all brainless, they got white powdered
angels sitting on their shoulders telling them what was what, all too
busy. . .</p>
<p><strong>114 continued: -</strong>: He sticks his finger by the side
of his nose and inhales.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: If they weren’t sniffing the dust they where
flicking the ash. And never trust who puts anything other than a finger
up his nose.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Did you know that it was my cousin Lorrie you
stabbed?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Yes I know I stabbed a man called Lorrie, but
no I didn’t know he was related to a tub a shit.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Shut that door Sean.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Lock that fuckin door Sean.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: You’re a big man, but I don’t care if you’re
ten foot fuckin tall, you still got eight pints of blood and you’ll
bleed like any bastard. And drop ya, I’ll open you up like a packet of
crisps.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: You’re a bully Ken, but remember, I am a bigger
bully.</p>
<p><strong>heavy fella</strong>: Ha, Ken what’ s going on? Bring em
through. The governor wants to see em.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: I gotta say you have got some front
coming round here Tone, you know the lads are picking straws. . .</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: You gotta diamond and it doesn’t belong to you,
it belongs to my colleague here.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: That’s what I love about you Tone, no
small talk.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: I said we should come round and raise fuckin
hell, you know shoot a few of the boys and that, but he said he thinks
we would have more success if we paid for it. So I am going to have a
drink and let you two discuss what you have to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Alright big man, I hope you aren’t bitter about
your cousin Lorrie.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: You know you’re alright when they’re are
talking business, I ’ d like to see you gob off outta here.</p>
<p><strong>btt �</strong>: Ohh do me a favour Ken, you’ve always been

fuckin whack but you’ll never get that anyway. You got it?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: I can’t sell you something I haven’t got

<p><strong>ken</strong>: You’re a dead fuckin man. You listen to me Tony
you’re a dead fuckin…</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: What did you do to upset Ken, Tony?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: He’s pissed in my fuckin pocket, look!</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Do shut up Ken. That was a bit naughty
Tony.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Well come on, let’s have a look.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: What are you playing at? -</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: It’s a zirconia.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I changed the stone.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I changed it. I know Brick Top knows nothing
about stones.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Yes but Doug the fuckin head does!</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Yeah well I didn’t expect them to lock us up
in here did I?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Ohh your one clever bastard Vin, you really
are. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: It’s at Lincoln’s.</p>
<p><strong>bad boy lincoln</strong>: What the fuck’s it doing at my
place?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Waiting for us to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What happen if they find that it’s a fake stone

<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Well we are going to get fucked Sol what do
you think is going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Ohh yes you are going to get fucked Vince.
-</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Oi Micky. Oi Micky.</p>
<p><strong>117 ’ int. van – night</strong>: We fade out of black to
Micky’s pov. Thisis shot in slow motion. Micky opens his eyes, in the
backof.a large van, there is only one faint light that
moodilyilluminates his tired eyes.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: You feeling alright Micky?</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: I’ve felt better.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: We are nearly there. They are a horrible
bunch this lot Micky so pay attention to what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Put up some kind of a show, he’s a hard
bastard this “good night” Anderson so don’t get too clever, he used to
be a pro. Just keep moving round the ring, and let the odd one go when
push has come to shove.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Let’s get on with it, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>118 int. warehouse - ’</strong>: A temporary ring has been
erected, four scaffolding posts with welded on hoops make the arena, the
ropes that are threaded through the hoops are industrial nylon and free
of padding. Around the ropes it’s starting to fill. Brick Top approaches
Salt Pete and Jack ‘the all seeing eye’.</p>
<p><strong>salt, peter</strong>: I hope we gonna get a better show this
time.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: This will make up for it. Micky’s going
down in the fourth. Terry over there is in charge of the bets. Now
you’ll have to forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Have we got the lads at the- camp
site?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Yeah they are there.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Where’s that fuckin pikey?</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: What’s wrong with you? You stoned? Is he
fuckin stoned?</p>
<p><strong>turkish . -</strong>: He’s like that before a fight.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Now you know when you’re going down?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Of course he knows when he’s going
down.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Hey fuck face, who’s speaking to you? He asked
him didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Fuck face? I like that, I ’ l l have to use
that one next time -I want to impress your mum Ken.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: The fourth… or was it the fifth..</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: There’s a campsite full of pikies that
might not think you’re so fuckin funny when they ’are putting the flames
out on their children’s backs.</p>
<p><strong>120 int. warehouse</strong>: Micky appears from a small door
at the back of the warehouse. He approaches the ring accompanied with
shouts of encouragement and counter shouts. He’s wearing a pair of semi
cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks down the front.
Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks bored. He climbs into the
ring. Then from the same door as the one through Micky came out walks a
larger character with a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds
with a frying pan: HORACE ’GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON.</p>
<p><strong>the reff</strong>: Alright lads no eye gouging no biting. Do
your worst. Back to your corners.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I don’t like the look of this Tommy, bring
the van up to the back door.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: They are on ya. You got to hurt him Micky.
Otherwise we are rumbled…. you hear me Micky? Do -something, it looks
like it’ s rigged.</p>
<p><strong>120 continued: -</strong>: BANG: he hits the ground again and
this time when he hits the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor,
like i t ’ s made out of water. He falls through the water like he’s
sinking; his eyes are open and he can’t breathe, he continues to fall,
but he’s unpanicked . When Micky 1 looks up he can see himself in the
corner of the ring takin kidney punches from Good Night, he’s winded and
only semi- conscious . Micky 1 makes the effort to swim up and tries to
penetrate the floor but he’s stuck he can’t get through. Micky 2 takes
more punishment in the ring, as Micky 1 ’ s hand continues to try to
break the underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces
Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how much trouble
Micky 2 ’ s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking now, he’s running out of
oxygen and Micky 2’s being beaten, Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now
flames tickle the bottom of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being
smashed to hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through
the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages to rise from
the depths and his punch manages to perforate the surface. The punch
continues its trajectory and has the power to fell a red blooded rhino….
it catches “Good Night” on the jaw and it’s good night for “Good Night”
it’s unlikely that he’ll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody
is in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: Tommy get the van.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I have it, it’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: We are off Micky, hold tight, and move
quickly. ,</p>
<p><strong>121 ext. caravan, pikey campsite</strong>: Darren picks up
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>daren .</strong>: If you would you like to speak to your
friends, you’ll have to speak a little -louder.</p>
<p><strong>121 continued:</strong>: We pull back to see four slumped
heads in the car and blood staining the windscreen. Brick Top calmly
puts the phone down.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Right lets get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>brick top</strong>: Where’s the car Ken?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: I t ’ s coming now.</p>

<p><strong>vinny</strong>: It was over there.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: We left it in a box over there…

<p><strong>vinny</strong>: I t ’ s empty.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Tony.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Dear oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: He’s not fuckin about, we left it there. It

<p><strong>hands</strong>: I mean open him up.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: That’s a bit strong isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: You wouldn’t have a problem if it was a
person.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: But it’s not, it’s a dog and I have never done
a dog.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: My heart bleeds.</p>
<p><strong>,btt</strong>: What dp I do?</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Let me take a wild and reckless guess. Stick
a knife in his guts and see if it’s got a diamond in there? I’ll hold it
still and’you open it up.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: Fuckin hell, alright then.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: You can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Well do it to you as well if it makes you
feel any better.</p>
<p><strong>btt</strong>: I t ’ s squeaking.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: What, you’ve never heard a dog squeak
before?… Hold him still.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: Stop! I can see it. I can see the stone.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Well let’s see it.</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. caravan camp site ;</strong>: The pikies have moved

<p><strong>sol</strong>: Well this is where they were.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Well they aren’t fuckin here now are they?

<p><strong>vinny</strong>: They can’t be far.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. car</strong>: Hands, BTT and the black guys are back
on the road.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: You gonna have to come up with something.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: There they are.</p>
<p><strong>126 int. new caravan camp site</strong>: All the caravans are
fastened to the back of cars. Vinny, Sol, BTT and Hands are standing in
front of Micky.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Well he’s didn’t come back to us.</p>
<p><strong>vinny</strong>: But he always came back.</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: Well you might have noticed that we have
moved, you should have fed him more, a dog will never leave you if you
feed it properly. It was a good dog, he had a little flatulence problem
but was a good dog.</p>
<p><strong>hands</strong>: Are you sure he’s not here?</p>
<p><strong>micky</strong>: I think I would have noticed if a fuckin dog
was sitting in my caravan don’t you? Tommy, Turkish, have you seen a dog
sitting in me caravan?</p>
<p><strong>turkish</strong>: I can’t say I have Micky.</p>
