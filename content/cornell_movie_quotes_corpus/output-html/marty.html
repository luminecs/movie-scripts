<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Marty, your mother wants you onna
phone.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Come on over about half past seven, we’ll
think of something. Hello, Ma, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Hello, Marty, when you coming home?
Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they’re
here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m coming home right now, Ma. I’ll be home
in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about
something.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Okay, you come on home, okay.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: He coming home right now.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the
milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa,
and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head
over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money
and how I can’t cook, and how I’m raising my baby all wrong, so she got
me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: She was here, you know, Wednesday,
and I said, “Catherine, my sister…”</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: So she say, “You’re spilling the milk.” So
she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got
me so mad, so I said, “Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?”
So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn’t throw it
at her. That’s just something she made up. She goes around telling
everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn’t throw it anywheres
near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the
house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, I don’t know what you want me
to do, Virginia. If you want me, I’ll go talk to her tonight.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you, Aunt Theresa…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Lemme tell it, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: We want you to do a very big favor for us,
Aunt Theresa.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here.
I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought
maybe Tommy’s mother could come here and live with you and Marty.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Because I called up Tommy’s brother Joe,
and I said, “Joe, she’s driving me crazy. Why don’t you take her for a
couple of years?” And he said, “Oh no!” I know I sound like a terrible
woman…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: No, Virginia, I know how you
feel.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I just can’t stand it any more! Every
minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don’t have ten minutes privacy
with my husband! We can’t even have a fight! We don’t have no privacy!
Everybody’s miserable in our house!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: All right, Ginnie, don’t get so excited.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: She’s right. She’s right. Young
husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister
Catherine, she’s my sister, but I gotta admit, she’s an old goat. And
plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her
myself. And I tell you now, as far as I’m concerned, if Catherine wantsa
come live here with me and Marty, it’s all right with me.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: himself, lowers his</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: We gotta ask Marty, of course.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You just sit here, I gotta turn the
fire on under the cooking.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: That’s very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: How’s Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Oh, he’s fine. You know a nice girl
he can marry?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Oh, he’ll get married, don’t worry, Aunt
Theresa.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, I don’t know. He sits arounna
house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a
bride?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Well, there’s the Stardust Ballroom. That’s
a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it’s just loaded with
girls. It’s a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to
be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go
in and you ask some girl to dance. That’s how I met Virginia. Nice,
respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell
him, “Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It’s loaded with tomatoes.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: The Stardust Ballroom. It’s loaded
with tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: This is very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa,
what you’re doing for us, and don’t think we don’t appreciate…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hello, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here.
They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would
it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right
with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she’s a lonely old lady. Nobody
wants her. Everybody’s throwing her outta their house…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure, Ma, it’s okay with me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You gotta good heart.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: He says okay, it’s all right
Catherine comes here.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a
load offa my mind.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, we got plenny-a room here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Sure! Sure! It’s gonna be nice! It’s
gonna be nice! I’ll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with
Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I just wanna thank you people again, because
the situation was just becoming impossible.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Siddown, Thomas, siddown.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I’m sorry we gotta rush like this…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: That’s all right, that’s all
right…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: On accounta…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I’m gonna see you tonight…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Marty, I don’t know how to tell you how much
I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing
was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some
milk for the baby. So my mother comes in…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Tommy, I promised the babysitter six
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a
little advice.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Sure, what?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You’re the accountant inna family, and I
figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop
to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live
alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives,
so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down,
although I think I can knock him downa four…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’ll see you at mass tomorrow. We’ll sit
down and we’ll discuss the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: All right, I’ll see you, Thomas, because he
wants an answer by Monday.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We’ll
work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: No, listen, that’s my mother, I’m gonna pay
for her…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Goodby, Marty!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Goodby, Virginia! See you soon!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hello, is this Mary Feeney?… Could I speak to
Miss Mary Feeney?… Just tell her an old friend…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …Oh, hello there, is this Mary Feeney? Hello
there, this is Marty Pilletti. I wonder if you recall me… Well, I’m kind
of a stocky guy. The last time we met was in a movie, the RKO Chester.
You was with another girl, and I was with a friend of mine named Angie.
This was about a month ago…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The RKO Chester in Westchester Square. You
was sitting in front of us, and we was annoying you, and you got mad,
and… I’m the fellow who works in a butcher shop… Come on, you know who I
am!… That’s right, we went to Howard Johnson’s and we had hamburgers.
You hadda milkshake… Yeah, that’s right. I’m the stocky one, the
heavy-set feller… Well, I’m glad you recall me, because I hadda swell
time that night, and I was just wondering how everything was with you.
How’s everything?… That’s swell… Yeah, well, I’ll tell you why I
called…I was figuring on taking in a movie tonight, and I was wondering
if you and your friend would care to see a movie tonight with me and my
friend… Yeah, tonight. I know it’s pretty late to call for a date, but I
didn’t know myself, till… Yeah, I know, well how about… Yeah, I know,
well maybe next Saturday night. You free next Saturday night?… Well, how
about the Saturday after that?… Yeah, I know… Yeah… Yeah… Oh, I
understand, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: So what are you gonna do tonight,
Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t know, Ma. I’m all knocked out. I may
just hang arounna house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Why don’t you go to the Stardust
Ballroom?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I say, why don’t you go to the
Stardust Ballroom? It’s loaded with tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s loaded with what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ha! Who told you about the Stardust
Ballroom?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Thomas. He told me it was a very nice
place.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, Thomas. Ma, it’s just a big dance hall,
and that’s all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with
tomatoes. Boy, you’re funny, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Marty, I don’t want you hang arounna
house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta
bachelor on your hands. I ain’t never gonna get married.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You gonna get married.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sooner or later, there comes a point in a
man’s life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is
that whatever it is that women like, I ain’t got it. I chased enough
girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don’t
wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real
brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that
hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn’t even wanna call up. She gave me the
brush. I don’t wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever
happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got
feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ma, I’m gonna stay home and watch Jackie
Gleason.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You gonna die without a son.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So I’ll die without a son.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Put on your blue suit…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Blue suit, gray suit, I’m still a fat man. A
fat ugly man.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You not ugly.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m ugly… I’m ugly! I’m UGLY!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ma! Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ma, waddaya want from me?! Waddaya want from
me?! I’m miserable enough as it is! Leave me alone! I’ll go to the
Stardust Ballroom! I’ll put onna blue suit and I’ll go! And you know
what I’m gonna get for my trouble? Heartache! A big night of
heartache!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Loaded with tomatoes…boy, that’s rich.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I told you she wasn’t especially attractive,
but that she had a good deal of charm, and she’s really a real nice
girl…</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: She’s all right, Andy. It’s just that I
get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting
something better, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I told you she wasn’t attractive…</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: You told me that she was a little tall,
but that she wasn’t bad looking at all.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Millie’s been after me to fix her up with a
date, so I…</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: All right, I’m having a fair time. It’s
just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to
wind up with something tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: I came up to dance, wadda you think? You
here with somebody?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m just here with another girl.</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: Where you going now?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them
in my coat.</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: That’s a girl used to know.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Boy, it’s packed in here.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Some of these kids are awful young. Aren’t
you afraid you’ll bump into one of your students?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I wouldn’t think so. I teach out in
Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You been up here before, Clara?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah, twice.</p>
<p><strong>millie</strong>: Shall we try to get a table and get
something to drink or shall we just go in and start dancing?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, Herbie…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, Herbie…</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You wanna have a drink before we start
dancing?</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: Listen. You people go grab a table. I’ll
be back inna minute. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So what do you say, Clara? Wanna see if we can
get a table?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: There was one nice-looking one there inna
black dress and beads, but she’s dancing now.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: There’s a nice-looking little short one for
you right now.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Down there. That little one there.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, she looks all right from here.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I’ll
take the one inna green dress.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I think this number is a little fast. Wait a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s all right, I think. They still
there?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Waddaya say, you wanna dance?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Excuse me, would you care for this dance?</p>
<p><strong>short girl</strong>: I don’t feel like dancing just yet.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>marty’s p.o.v.</strong>: The Short Girl is approached by a
dapper young BOY who asks her to dance. She smiles, excuses herself to
her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: You here stag or with a girl?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You say something?</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: Yeah. I was just asking you if you was
here stag or with a girl.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m stag.</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you. I got stuck on a
blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I
was wondering how I’m gonna get rid of the girl I’m with. Somebody to
take her home, you know what I mean? I’d be glad to pay you five bucks
if you take her home for me.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: I’ll take you over, and I’ll introduce
you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I’ll cut out. Because I got
this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I’ll pay you
five bucks.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: No, I’m not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You can’t just walk off onna girl like
that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. keegan</strong>: …in that case, as long as she’s going
home alone, give me the five bucks back…</p>
<p><strong>stag</strong>: Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks. I was
willing. It’s my five bucks…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Excuse me, Miss, would you care to dance?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: she pulls off her</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: We didn’t tell her anything yet. We
thought that we’d leave it to you. We thought you’d put it like how you
were lonely, and why don’t she come to live with you. Because that way
it looks like she’s doing you a favor, insteada we’re throwing her out,
and it won’t be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here
with you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I think it be a better idea if you
and Thomas go out, because otherwise she’s gonna start a fight with you,
and everybody’s gonna be yelling.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hello, Aunt Theresa.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Hello, Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I just this minute got the baby to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask
her is you say that you’re very lonely, see? And wouldn’t she come and
keep you company, because that way, you see…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m gonna take care-a
the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>catherine’s voice</strong>: Who’s there?! Who’s there?!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: It’s me, Catherine! How you feel?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hey! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I came to see you. How you feel?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg
throbs like a drum.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I been getting a pain in my
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have
a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can’t sleep. It’s a
curse to be old. How you feel?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I feel fine.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, how’s everything with you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: My son Marty’s fine. Everybody’s
fine…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: We gotta postcard from my son Nickie
and his bride. They’re inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon.
Everything is very nice.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: That’s nice. I gotta letter from my
husband’s cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned
the tavern in Abruzzi?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I don’t think I remember him.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Well, he died. You know who else
died?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You know the old man upstairs in this
house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital
two weeks. He died yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, I always like to visit you,
Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna
fish?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Hey, why don’t you go to the movie?
Your mother and me, we’re gonna be baby-sitter.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Listen, let’s go downa Kaplans’ apartment.
They told us to come down.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Sure, sure.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: All right, Ma, we’re going downstairs to the
Kaplans, if you want us for anything.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I wake up this morning, I hear the baby
crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her
hand atta baby. I said, “You brute! Don’t you strike that baby! That’s
my son’s baby!”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: It’s her baby too, you know.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: That’s my son Thomas’s baby.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, it ain’t your baby.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a
milk at me?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You told me.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: She’s a witch, that one. I tell you what
happen yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: What happen?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: She gave me the evil eye.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Ufa!</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I keep one eye open when I sleep, because
she’s gonna come in, stab me in my bed.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Catherine, I want you come live in my
house with Marty and me.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Ah?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You son Thomas and Virginia, they
come to my house this afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Your son Thomas and his wife
Virginia…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: When was this?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: This afternoon, about four, five
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What they say?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You know what they say. They say
things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave
him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don’t want no old
lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come
live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your
own room. You don’t have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here.
We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear
to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: My son Thomas came to see you this
afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his
house?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Catherine, don’t make an opera outta
this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an
old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you
drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good,
an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same
kitchen, anna house burns down.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: So I am an old garbage bag, put inna
street.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Oh, Catherine, please! Don’t make a
tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It pains that they should do this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I know it pains.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: These are the worst years, I tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Catherine, you are very dear to me.
We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have
gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house,
because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: These are the worst years. I tell you.
It’s gonna happen to you. I’m afraida look inna mirror. I’m afraid I’m
gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park,
little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I’m fifty- six
years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I
wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an
old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the
terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Catherine, my sister…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It’s gonna happen to you! It’s gonna
happen to you! What will you do if Marty gets married?! What will you
cook? What happen to alla children playing in alla rooms? Where is the
noise?! It is a curse to be a widow! A curse. What will you do if Marty
gets married?! What will you do?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I will put my clothes inna bag, and I
will come to you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You come up here often?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I was up here twice before. Once with a
friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time… do you see that
girl in the gray dress sitting over there?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Well, the last time I was up here, that’s
where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a
muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then
change his mind. I’ll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a
half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up
and go home.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I cry a lot too. I’m a big cryer.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: This is something recent with me, this
bursting into tears at the least thing.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My
brothers, my brother-in- laws, they’re always telling me what a
goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don’t get goodhearted by accident. You
get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I
know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I’m having a very
good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you’re
not such a dog as you think you are.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m having a very good time, too.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So there you are. So I guess I’m not such a
dog as I think I am.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You’re a very nice guy, and I don’t know why
some girl hasn’t grabbed you off long ago.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t know either. I think I’m a very nice
guy. I also think I’m a pretty smart guy in my own way.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Now I figure, two people get married, and
they gonna live together forty, fifty years. So it’s just gotta be more
than whether they’re good looking or not. You tell me you think you’re
not very good-looking. My father was a really ugly man, but my mother
adored him. She told me that she used to get so miserable sometimes,
like everybody, you know? And she says my father always tried to
understand. I used to see them sometimes when I was a kid, sitting in
the living room, talking and talking, and I used to adore my old man,
because he was so kind. That’s one of the most beautiful things I have
in my life, the way my father and mother were. And my father was a real
ugly man. So it doesn’t matter if you look like a gorilla. So you see,
dogs like us, we ain’t such dogs as we think we are.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m twenty-nine years old. How old are
you?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m thirty-four.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …you teach chemistry? That’s funny. Where?
What school?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Benjamin Franklin High School.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Benjamin Franklin, where’s that? Brooklyn? I
went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It’s right
arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who’s a teacher. He
teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but
he gave it up after his first vows.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I was pretty good in high school. I sound
like a jerk now, but I was pretty good. I graduated with an eighty-two
average. That ain’t bad. I was accepted at City College. I filled out
the application and everything, but my old man died, so I hadda go to
work. My best class was German. That was my first language. Der, die,
das – des, der, des. There you are, I still remember…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You know what I was good at in high school? I
was good in Math. You know how long ago I graduated high school? June,
nineteen-thirty-seven. Holy cow! June, nineteen-thirty-seven! What is
that? Fifteen, seventeen years ago! Holy cow! Seventeen years ago! Is
that right? Seventeen, that’s right. Where did it all go? I’m getting
old. I’m gonna be thirty- five November eighth. Thirty-five. Wow. Time
goes on, boy.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Nineteen-thirty-seven… that’s right. My old
man died December, nineteen- thirty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Two o’clock in the morning he died. The
doorbell rings, and I knew something was wrong right away. Because my
room is onna ground floor inna front, you see, and I got outta bed, and
I answered the door…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: There was Mr. Stern. He had a house down
about a block from us. He moved out though. My old man, he used to play
cards with him and some other old guys. He’s a Jewish feller. So he
said, “Is your mother home?” So I knew right away there was something
wrong. I was only eighteen, exactly eighteen years old, just the month
before. So I said, “Is something wrong, Mr. Stern?” I was in my pajamas,
you know? So he said, “Marty, your father died.” My father died right
inna middle of playing cards, right at the table. He had a heart attack.
He had low blood pressure, my old man. He used to faint a lot.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Boy, am I talking, I never talked so much in
my life. Usually, everybody comes to me and tells me all their troubles.
Well, I’m gonna shut up now, and I’m gonna let you get a word in…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Seventeen years ago. What I been doing with
myself all that time?… Well, I’m talking again. I must be driving you
crazy. Mosta the time I’m with a girl, I can’t find a word to say. Well,
I’m gonna shut up now. Because I’m not like this usually. Usually, I…
well, here I go again.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I can’t shut my mouth… I’m on a jag, for
Pete’s sake. You’d think I was loaded…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I can’t stop talking! Isn’t this stupid?!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You gotta real nice face, you know? It’s
really a nice face.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …so I’m inna kneeling position, and if you
ever try shooting a BAR inna kneeling position, you know what I mean. I
can’t holda steady position. I’m wavering back and forth…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …so the guy next to me, he’s shooting from
the prone position, and he’s cross-eyed like I told you…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So just then… …so just then I hear five shots
go off from the guy next to me…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So my target goes down, and a minute later,
the flag comes up. I got five bulls-eyes. This cross-eyed guy next to
me, he shot five bulls-eyes into my target…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …so I said to the sergeant who was checking
my score, “Pretty good, eh, Sarge? Five bulls-eyes? So this sergeant, he
don’t know what happened, he says,”Say, that’s all right, Pilletti”…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, man. So that’s what happened. That’s how
I got the reputation-a being the best shot inna whole battalion… oh,
man…</p>
<p><strong>bucko</strong>: Anything good in there, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: A buncha dogs.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty, you in here?!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …When I got outta the army, Clara, I was
lost. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old,
what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I
thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know?
But I wouldn’t graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old,
even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get
married, and I had three unmarried sisters – in an Italian home, that’s
a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he’s a one got married last
week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three,
four o’clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My
uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack
onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for
what I’m gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I
used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I’m going
to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m a Catholic, you know, and even to think
about suicide is a terrible sin.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So then Mr. Gazzara – he was a frienda my
father – he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody
pleaded with me to take it. So that’s what happened. I didn’t wanna be a
butcher.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with being a
butcher.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t call it an elegant
profession. It’s in a lower social scale. People look down on
butchers.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell
his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move
out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter.
Because she’s always writing them to come out there. So it’s a nice
little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five
percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a
hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you
gotta worry about the supermarkets. There’s two inna neighborhood now,
and there’s an A&amp;P coming in, at least that’s the rumor. Of course,
mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they
get married, and they don’t stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I
mean, you gotta take that into account too.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It’s my feeling that you really want to buy
this shop, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s true. I do. But I’m gonna have to take
outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That’s a big note to carry,
because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh
is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Marty, I know you for three hours, but I know
you’re a good butcher. You’re an intelligent, sensitive, decent man. I
have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one
reason or another. And some of these kids, Marty, in my classes, they
have so much warmth in them, so much capacity. And that’s the feeling I
get about you.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: If you were one of my students, I would say,
“Go ahead and buy the butcher shop. You’re a good butcher.”</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: the timbre of his</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Wadda you think?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I think anything you want to do, you’ll do
well.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m Catholic. Are you Catholic?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I only got about three bucks on me now, but I
just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster
Avenue. Why don’t we walk back to my house? I’ll run in, pick up some
dough, and let’s step out somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I really should get home…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s only a quarter of twelve. The clock’s
right over there.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I really should get home, I told my father…
Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there’s any place
around here I could put some makeup on…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, Mac!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You gotta Ladies’ Room around here?</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Inna back.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Inna back.</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: …so she told me that the doctor
told her that if she had any more babies, she would do so at the risk of
her life…</p>
<p><strong>second irish woman</strong>: She was always a bit thin in the
hips…</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: Well, at the time she told me
this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was
either…</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Hey, Lou!</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: …going to the hospital or coming
from it. She was hatching them out like eggs.</p>
<p><strong>second irish woman</strong>: And that husband of hers is a
skinny bit of a fellow, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: Well, I bumped into her on the
street, and she was as big as a barrel.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Hey, Lou!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: opening a batch of</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: …so I said to her, “Mary…</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Marty been in here the last coupla hours or
so?</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: “…Mary, for heaven’s sakes,
didn’t you tell me that another one’ll kill you?”</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I ain’t seen Marty all night…</p>
<p><strong>second irish woman</strong>: And her husband is a little bit
of a man, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Bartender, but even</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: Well, last week Tuesday, she gave
birth to the baby in Saint Elizabeth’s hospital… a big healthy boy of
nine pounds…</p>
<p><strong>second irish woman</strong>: Oh, that’s nice. So the doctor
was wrong, wasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: Oh, no! She died right in the
hospital…</p>
<p><strong>second irish woman</strong>: Oh, that’s a sad story. And her
husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.</p>
<p><strong>first irish woman</strong>: That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>second irish woman</strong>: Oh, that’s a sad story.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: …It’s really a fine opportunity for me. But
I’m not sure I want to be a department head. It’s mostly executive and
administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he
depends on me a great deal, and…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Why don’t you just move out to
Portchester?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Well, that’s what I was saying. My father is
getting old. And we’re very close. He’s a wonderful man, really…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I think you’re kidding yourself, Clara. I
used to think about moving out, you know? And that’s what I used to say.
“My mother needs me.” But when you really get down to it, that ain’t it
at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You’re
living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go
on like that – being a little girl all your life.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m afraid of being lonely.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, you won’t be so lonely. You’ll make
friends right away.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Actually, I don’t make friends easily.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’re you talking about? You’re a real
likeable person. You’ll make friends out there in Portchester one, two,
three. You’ll have people visiting you alla time. I’ll come visit you.
I’ll borrow my brother Freddie’s car, or you can call me up when you
feel blue, or I’ll call you up. And it’s gonna be nice. Don’t be so
afraid.</p>

<p><strong>ralph</strong>: toward the rear of the car and raising</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hiya.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What are we going to do, just sit around
here all night?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: bowed head in a quick</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m with a girl, Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I can’t do that, Ralph, because somebody
already brushed her off once tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: This is a good deal here, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I can’t do it, Ralph. Thanks anyway. Very
nice to have met you all.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Come on, let’s get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Hey, Ralph, we might as well get going.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’ll see you, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: I’ll see you, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Wait a minute. Lemme find the light.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I guess my mother ain’t home yet. I figure my
cousin Thomas and Virginia musta gone to the movies, so they won’t get
back till one o’clock at least.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: This is the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Come on inna dining room.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Siddown, take off your coat. You want
something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: on the edge of a</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie
got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this
statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I
never saw anything so grand in my life. And watta meal. I’m a butcher,
so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet,
right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you
wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it
comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it’s trimmed. Listen,
Clara, make yourself comfortable. You’re all tense.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You want me to take you home, I’ll take you
home.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Maybe that would be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No, Marty, please…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I like you. I like you. I been telling you
all night, I like you…</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I just wanna kiss, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: All right! I’ll take you home! All right!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: All I wanted was a lousy kiss! What do you
think, I was gonna try something serious with my mother coming home any
minute!? What am I, a leper or something?!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I just didn’t feel like it, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m old enough to know better. Comes New
Year’s Eve, everybody starts arranging parties, I’m the guy they gotta
dig up a date for. Let me getta packa cigarettes, and I’ll take you
home.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’d like to see you again. Very much. The
reason I didn’t let you kiss me was because I just didn’t know how to
handle the situation. You’re the kindest man I ever met. The reason I
tell you this is because I want to see you again very much. I know that
when you take me home, I’m going to just lie on my bed and think about
you. I want very much to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Waddaya doing tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’ll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe,
we’ll go see a movie.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’d like that very much.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The reason I can’t be definite about it now
is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to
help out.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’ll wait for your call.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We better get started to your house, because
the buses only run about one an hour now.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’ll just get a packa cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Waddaya doing New Year’s Eve?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti’s voice</strong>: Hallo! Hallo! Marty?!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Hello, Marty, when you come home?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We just got here about fifteen minutes ago.
Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She’s graduate of New York
University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Siddown, siddown. You want some
chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home.
Thank you very much anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, siddown a minute. I just come
inna house. I’ll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How’d you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a
ride?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Oh, it’s a sad business. My sister,
Catherine, she don’t get along with her daughter-in-law, so she’s gonna
come live with us.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, she’s coming, eh, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Oh, sure. Siddown, siddown. Marty,
tell her siddown.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Did you offer the young lady some
fruit?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I offered her, Ma, she don’t want
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: It’s a very sad business, I tell you.
A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now
she’s just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law’s couch. It’s a
curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is
left for you to do? What is a mother’s life but her children? It is a
very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Couldn’t she find some sort of hobby to fill
out her time?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and
she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to
cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible
years.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You mustn’t feel too harshly against her
daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to
cook for.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You don’t think my sister Catherine
should live in her daughter-in-law’s house?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Well, I don’t know the people, of course, but
as a rule, I don’t think a mother-in-law should live with a young
couple.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Where do you think a mother-in-law
should go?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I don’t think a mother should depend so much
upon her children for her rewards in life.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, maybe that’s what they teach
you in New York University. In real life, it don’t work out that way.
You wait till you are a mother.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It’s silly of me to argue about it. I don’t
know the people involved.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ma, I’m gonna take her home now. It’s getting
late, and the buses only run about one an hour.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti.
I hope I’ll see you again.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: All right, Ma. I’ll be back in about an hour,
an hour anna half.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Hey!!</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Hey, Marty! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>angie’s voice</strong>: Hey, Marty! Marty!</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been
looking all over for you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out,
but I couldn’t find you.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: I been looking all over for you!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What happened, Angie, was that we thought we
were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna
come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to
meet Clara… Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about
him.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Waddaya gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m gonna take Clara home. It’s close to
one.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: You want me to ride down with you?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: It’s early.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It must be one o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: It’s Saturday night! There’s still plenty-a
action around!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it’s
gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it’s gonna be two
o’clock. I gotta get up for ten o’clock mass tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: All right, I’ll see you!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow after mass!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You got an elevator in this house?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: We just live one flight up.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So I’ll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Call me about two-thirty, because I won’t be
home from my aunt’s till about then.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Okay, so I’ll see you tomorrow night
then.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>series of intercuts</strong>: Marty strides, walks, stops
short, goes to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves
back. The traffic moves by him. He stands in the wide street, then with
a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises his arm and calls
out.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Taxi! Taxi! Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Taxi!… Taxi!…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Don’t you think I feel lousy about this
too?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: All right, Ginnie. I don’t wanna talk
anymore about it. I don’t think I got one hour’s sleep the whole night.
Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you
know that?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Tommy…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I know what you’re gonna say. A man’s gotta
stop being his mother’s baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna
say it? She’s my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about
her, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Why do you always put me inna position of
being the louse?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Virginia, I don’t wanna hear no more about
it!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Tommy, I love you, and I know you feel
lousy right now, but we’re never gonna be happy unless we have a chance
to work out our own lives. We can’t keep talking in whispers like this
the resta our lives. We gotta have some privacy. We…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Can’t you wait five minutes? I’ll drive you
over inna car. I just gotta put my shirt on, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: All right, get dressed, because we’re gonna
drive my mother over. Why couldn’t you get along with her?! Why couldn’t
you make just a little effort?! She’s a little hard to get along with!
All right! All I asked you was try a little.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Tommy…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I don’t wanna hear anymore about it, you
hear me?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hello, Aunt Theresa.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda
beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be
the big martyr.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Hey, will you go to mass, please. This
one, he woke up this morning with salt in his nose. Do this! Do that!
Will you leave me in peace, ah?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hello, Aunt Catherine! How are you? Hello,
Thomas. You going to mass with us?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I was at mass two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, make yourself at home. The refrigerator
is loaded with food. Go upstairs, take any room you want. Thomas, you
going to mass with us?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yeah, yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: You wanna cuppa coffee?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Sure, great if you ain’t married.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hi, Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, little boy, you sure getting fat. You
weigh more than a side-a beef now. Hey, Thomas, so I was telling you
yesterday you was over my house – Mr. Gazzara, my boss, so he wantsa
sell his shop, go out to California because his kids are all married,
and he…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Wadda you so sore about?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So Thomas, he does about twelve, thirteen
hundred gross. Rent’s a hundred and two. The problem, of course, is the
supermarkets. That’s what I wanna ask you. If I get together with a
coupla other merchants, make our own supermarket…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What about the time she wanted to make an
old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn’t let
her!?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Waddaya talking about?!!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Once a month you couldn’t let her use the
kitchen!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I told her she could use the kitchen any
time she wanted…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: …You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla
time!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: She don’t wanna use my pots and pans!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So Tommy…</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Waddaya want me to do, go out and buy a
whole new setta pots and pans?!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I
promised Mr. Gazzara I’d let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know,
Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it
operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I’m the
butcher and Aldo Capelli, he’s the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I
mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Waddaya talking about, do you know what
you’re talking about?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No, I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking
you.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Take the baby, will you?!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you
tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no
responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself
down with a shop? What’s he want? Five thousand down? You’re gonna have
to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note
from the bank. For Pete’s sake, you’re a single man with no
responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big
problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy’s shop, that’s a specialized
trade. The supermarkets don’t carry Italian meat.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my
wife buys Italian meat? She goes to the A&amp;P, picks up some lamb
chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that’s dinner,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Sure, all you wanna eat is that greasy
stuff your mother makes.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, I understand the problem about the
supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made
the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Marty, see that my mother is nice and
comfortable, eh?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure. This girl said…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What girl, what does she know? Why don’t you
let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa
take the kid for a day, that’s fine!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Your mother handles the kid like he was a
yoyo!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Hey, I come home from your house last
night, Marty was here with a girl.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Marty.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Your son Marty?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Well, what Marty you think is gonna
be here in this house with a girl?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Were the lights on?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Oh sure. This girl is a college
graduate.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: They’re the worst. College girls are one
step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph,
his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the
streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: That’s the first time Marty ever
brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has
a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that
all morning.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Well, that’s all. You will see. Today,
tomorrow, inna week, he’s gonna say to you, “Hey, Ma, it’s no good being
a single man. I’m tired-a running around.” Then he’s gonna say, “Hey,
Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don’t we sell this old house, move
into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I don’t sell this house, I tell you
that. This is my husband’s house. I had six children in this house.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You will see. A coupla months, you gonna
be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law’s house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Catherine, you are a blanket of
gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and
we gonna declare a holiday.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it’s getting a little
late.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Boy, this place is really coming to pieces.
You know, Ma, I think we oughta sell this place. The whole joint’s going
to pieces. The plumbing is rusty. Everything. I’m gonna have to
replaster the whole ceiling now. You know what we oughta do? We oughta
get one of those new apartments they’re building down on Southern
Boulevard. A nicer parta town, you know?…You all set, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I’m all set.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: That was a nice girl last night,
Marty. She wasn’t a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice
girl. I said, she wasn’t a very good-looking girl… not very pretty…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I heard you, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: She looks a little old for you. About
thirty-five, forty years old?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: She’s twenty-nine, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: She’s more than twenty-nine years
old, Marty. That’s what she tells you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: She looks thirty-five, forty. She
didn’t look Italian to me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I said, is she Italian girl?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: She don’t look Italian to me. What
kinda family she come from? There was something about her I didn’t like.
It seems funny, the first time you meet her, she comes to your empty
house alone. These college girls, they all one step fromma streets.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What are you talking about? She’s a nice
girl.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: She didn’t look Italian to me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I don’t like her.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You don’t like her. You only met her for two
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: Don’t bring her to the house no
more.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What didn’t you like about her?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pilletti</strong>: I don’t know! She don’t look like
Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, let’s not get inna fight about it,
Ma.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What are you getting so worked up about? I
just met the girl last night. I’m probably not gonna see her again.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: He was here last night till about two
o’clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Angie. He says she was a real scrawny-
looking thing.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: She wasn’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hello, Ralph. How’d you make out with those
nurses last night, Ralph?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night,
Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How’d you make out?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, I hadda nice time…I didn’t try nothing.
She’s a nice girl. I just met her last night, you know. I just talked
with her. I didn’t even try nothing…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Listen, you see Angie, tell him I went home,
I’ll meet him after lunch.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: …so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he’s
inna room there with this doll. So he says, “You rat, you are the
murderer.” So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she
loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she’s laying
there, gasping for breath, and she says, “How could you do that?” And he
says, “It was easy.”</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can
write.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you
a plate-a your own.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Oh, I couldn’t eat nothing. My mother just
stuffed me right up to the jaws.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows
how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with
a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful
twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful
society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and…</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can
write.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Listen, somebody turn onna ballgame. It must
be after one o’clock by now.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Who you gonna call?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I was gonna call that girl from last night.
Take her to a movie tonight.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were
very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned
and walked off. Now, why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: You got me mad, that’s why. Hey, Joe, show
Marty that picture.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Put that away, for Pete’s sake. My mother’s
right out onna porch.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I wonder where they find those girls that pose
for them pictures.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Those are Hollywood starlets.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Put it away, Joe. My mother’ll come walking
in.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Marty, let’s go downna Seventy-Second Street
area tonight.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t feel like going, Angie. I thought I’d
take this girl to a movie.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Boy, you really musta made out good last
night.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We just talked.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta

<p><strong>joe</strong>: I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who’s
twenny years younger than he is so that when he’s forty, his wife is a
