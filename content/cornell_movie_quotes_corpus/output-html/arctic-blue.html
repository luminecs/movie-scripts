<p><strong>arctic blue</strong>: by Ross LaManna</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What a beauty. Hand me the transmitter.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He’s coming around fine.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Be right back. I left my camcorder in
the car.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Anne Marie! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Goddamn trappers!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Takes nerve, laying traplines on restricted
land.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He still might be around. I saw fresh tire
tracks coming in.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Man and a jeep, about a mile and a half
down.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Where the fuck did you drop Corbett
off?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: He’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Be careful – there’re two of them.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: If I unzip my parka, stick this out the
window.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: No shooting. Let’s see who’s so interested
in us.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Ain’t worth it, Ben…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You got two counts against you – trapping out
of season and poaching on restricted land.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Can’t be much of a crime, if all they got
minding the area is a cocky kid.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you
feel like spending a few months in jail.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Ben? Sure you don’t want me to drop the
fucker?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You leave and don’t come back, that’s the end
of it.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Great idea – pointing a lousy dart gun
at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Bastards took off, though, didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: All this fuckin’ land, and we’re locked
out. Makes me puke.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Jawing about it won’t change it.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Three hundred seventy-five million acres in
this state. I’m real tired of runnin’ into people.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Then don’t look to your left.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Leave it here.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Let’s keep going. We’re only an hour from
Devil’s Cauldron.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Relax. I just want to ask them how the
hunting is.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Looks like you’ve had some luck. Where’s
your guide?</p>
<p><strong>sportsman #1</strong>: We’re on our own, if it’s any of your
damn business.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You did real good.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: No swinging shit. They’re over their
goddamned limit.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: My friend is right. Supposed to have a
licensed guide when you’re on this land, too.</p>
<p><strong>sportsman #1</strong>: Hey, we paid our fuckin’ permit
fees.</p>
<p><strong>sportsman #2</strong>: I were you, I’d drive right on outta
here again. Now.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: This was my roaming land, ’til the
government took it over. Only Innuit can hunt here now, and tourists,
like you.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: According to tribal law, hunters passing
through the land of another tribe can only take game to survive. They
can eat the meat, but have to surrender the hides.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Want the meat?</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: I say shoot ’em, bury ’em with their shiny
new car.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: If you’re gonna take something, take it
and let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Put him in your truck. Smell of blood will
attract the bears. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It was self defense. Leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: You think those fucks will tell it that
way?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: We’ll get a head start before they go
crying to the law.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You can pack out of here – two, three days’
hike along this river at most. Weather should hold this early in the
season.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Think I’m pretty? You better forget how we
look, ’cause next time they won’t keep me from killing you. This land
ain’t quite civilized, you know…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: At least he scalped the dead one.</p>
<p><strong>leo meyerling</strong>: for State Legislature</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Hullo, Sam. Slow day?</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Ben…boys. Yeah, real slow, and I’d like to
keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Needs patching.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Twenty-five dollar.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Sure have learned to worship the white
man’s god.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: I hope I can count on you gentlemen to
vote for The People’s Friend this November.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Share some of that oil company money in
your pocket and you can.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: One flier comes loose and I shoot you for
littering.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Have your fun… just remember The People’s
Friend come election day.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Oil Company candidate running on that slogan
makes about as much sense as a rat fucking a grapefruit.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Hard to work up an interest in politics,
way we live. You’re the first people we’ve seen in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: How about a quart of Jack Daniel’s?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: How about it is right. Back in the primary
this town was voted dry.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Aw, shit. Let’s go. Leave a note for Viking
Bob, tell him to meet us in Cache.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Relax. One more day without drink won’t
kill you. Right, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I’m living proof of that sad fact.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: No, I better stay at my post.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: So much for the walking weather you
predicted.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Had no choice… …Given the situation.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I know. Least you didn’t shoot all of
them.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Fuck you, Mitchell. Woulda been my ass if
Ben didn’t waste that prick.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Mitchell, look, it don’t take three of us
to wait for Viking Bob.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Go ahead. Take the jeep. I’ll come to Cache
with Bob when he gets here.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Okay by me. You’re the one likes these hot
springs so much.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Leave my traps. We’ll tag up, couple
days.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide
open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: I bet you haven’t had lunch.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Bet you’re right. But I didn’t come by to
wangle a meal –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – We appreciate the company. Anne Marie’s
getting cabin fever already.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: What’d you say they call these
spaceships?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Mobile Arctic Dwelling – MAD.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: I call it ‘the Turtle,’ as in carrying
your home on your back.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around
to find us.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: The little creep hates it that Eric
actually does what the company hired him to do.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Watch it with Meyerling. Man’s as mean and
corrupt as they get. Cut his mother’s throat if it’d get him a couple
votes.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Hey, Sam, look over there. Black and white
smoke.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Damn. Likely that’s an SOS. Have to pass on
that lunch.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Stupid goddamn greenhorns! Froze to
death.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: It’s not even winter!</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: They got wet in the rain. Core body
temperature dropped, got drowsy, probably didn’t even know what was
happening.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Question is why they sat here when the storm
moved in. Check their stuff while I sniff around.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: They had Emergency Locater Transmitters, but
didn’t use them. Maybe because they didn’t bring batteries.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I’m too old for this shit.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Any idea who could’ve done it?</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Even for Ben Corbett, this is nasty. Man’s
got balls. He was sitting in Devil’s Cauldron when I left, calm as can
be.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Thank God. You can arrest him.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Not necessarily. Corbett’s awful hardbitten
these days.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: His old roaming area’s all private reserve
now. Normally, long as he stays civil in my jurisdiction, I let him be.
Won’t be able to take him by my lonesome, though. Nobody in town’ll lift
a finger on this.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’ll go into town with you.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Eric, leave it alone. It’s not your
business.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No way can he get away with this. I’ll be back
by tonight.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ben Corbett?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Yep. Afraid you have me at a
disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Kenai at the general store asked me to bring
these. Didn’t expect we’d already met.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: No big deal. We just got off on the wrong
foot. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Desmond.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: New to the country, kid?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Six months. Ecological study for Northland
Oil.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Ecology. Folks use that term for everything
but what it means: who’s eating who.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Now, why don’t you get around to saying
what you want.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You wouldn’t shoot anyone…</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: But I would.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: All this for laying traps on private
land?</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: You left a footprint at the Sportsmen’s
camp. Only pretty sight there, Ben, ’cause the two men you didn’t shoot
and mutilate died of exposure.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Christ if I shouldn’t know better than to
step in soft earth. I’ve seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years
old.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I got it from here. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my
kit, will you?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Before white men came, my people lived in sod
houses underground and laid our dead on the tundra. Now we live above
ground and bury our dead, and we haven’t been warm since.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Nice bluff the other day with the
tranquilizer gun out your jeep window. See you again, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah. Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I need to call Fairbanks.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Neff! Dial it up. State police.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Fairbanks Alascom? Patch me through to the
State Police.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil’s
Cauldron. Had some killings here. I got a suspect; be real nice if
someone came and took him off my hands.</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: On a good day I couldn’t spare a
crosswalk guard. But now, no way. Folks’re batshit with the weather
turning sour. Bring him in yourself.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Next plane’s not coming ’til next
Monday.</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: Sit your suspect out in the cold.
He’ll keep.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: This man’s friends ain’t gonna look
favorably on his incarceration.</p>
<p><strong>state policeman</strong>: So shoot him. Won’t have to feed
him that way –</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Sam, listen – I shot to defend my man.
Other guy drew first.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: If that was all, fine. But carving him up,
stranding the others, that’s too fucking much. Is everything that walks,
crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’ll get loose before that plane comes.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Don’t try me. I’ll kill you if it comes to
it.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Mr. Desmond! Arthur Neff. Area rep for the
Federal Assistance Plan. Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies
coming.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Snowplow, generator, TV dish… hell, we get the
goddamn Playboy Channel! Here, this is for you.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Did you catch Corbett?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Sure did. He was one of the trappers we
rousted from the Haul Road.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Was there any trouble?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Going after killers isn’t the same as
chasing poachers, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Can’t help myself. Corbett’s type always
pisses me off. Oh, I found this at the post office. Had your name on
it.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Oh, sweetheart. It’s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You were looking at it in the catalog. Don’t
know where you can wear it…</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: I’ll wear it for you. And I can wear it
when we go home. We won’t be here forever.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You make it sound like a prison sentence.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: That’s not what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’s exactly what you meant.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Look, why get into this again. As long
as it’s working, let’s leave it alone. It’s been nice so far. We’re
together –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – Permanently?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Do I want to be with you permanently?
Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live? That I
don’t know. C’mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was
totally</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: I’m looking for some trappers. Ben
Corbett, Mitchell, LeMalle. Seen ’em?</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Yesterday. Said they were going to Cache. They
were thirsty, but we were voted dry.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: These yours?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Gonna make an offer. Man who owns them won’t
need them where he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Back against the bars. Now.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Your brother and the boys left me some traps
to sell for them. They’re gone –</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: – To Cache. So I heard. Ben never said
nothing to me about selling his gear.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Bob! They got me on a murder charge!</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Sorry, Bob. I’ll have to keep you here ’til
I ship him south.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: You stupid, greedy, loudmouth sonofabitch!
He’ll have the others here in a few hours. You fucked me up, now you’re
gonna help me move him.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Forget it, Sam. I never work for free.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: I still can’t believe I’m being financed
by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.
Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I thought I should check our emergency
transmitters.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Avalanche season is coming.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Winter. Two straight months of night –
we may never get out of bed. Which would suit me fine.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Not me. I’m equipped.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Allow me to give you a practical
demonstration of low-light infrared photography…</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me
excited, too.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Come here…</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Where’s Ben Corbett?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: I have no argument with you, Bob. Wilder said
I could keep his truck if I drove it ten miles away from town.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Where did they go?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: He didn’t say, but I would guess the opposite
way from here.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I got an emergency on my hands.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: …You give us a ride in the Cessna you got
hangared at the pumping station, we’ll be in Fairbanks in a few
hours.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’s what we should’ve done in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I could’ve sat tight for the transport, ’til
Bob came poking around.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a
good-looking girl –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – To take you to jail? It’ll be my
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: You better get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Good idea. Flying over mountains can give
you some nasty surprises. Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big
rock inside it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’ll get you there all right.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Goddammit, I don’t need this aggravation.
I’ll shoot you, Ben. Bank on it.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I don’t want to hurt you, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: I’m not too old to knock the snot out of
you!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You want to try that handgun against this
rifle, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Some day you might have to face me without
a gun.</p>
<p><strong>wilder</strong>: Fetch him back? Don’t let him walk…</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Does he have people?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: A daughter in Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Send him down to her. There’s money in my
duffel bag, back at his cabin.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I better call in.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thought of everything, huh?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Surviving is what I know –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – Killing is what you know. Pack some food
while I prep for the flight. I’m sure not gonna let him go.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: C’mon, girl, talk to me, negotiate with
me…</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: LeMalle. We got a problem. Where’s
Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Goddamn! Viking Bob! Mitchell’s inside,
boring bastard…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: …Ben never sent a signal.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Musta never got a chance to -more-</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Meaning he’ll need a plane.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Closest planes for hire are here in
Cache.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Hang on… Remember that Cessna we saw at
the pumping station on the Haul Road? Belongs to the guy they got
patrolling the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: There you go. Wilder’s always chummy with
the fuckin’ Bambi-lovers.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: It’s a long shot.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You got a better idea?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: How long have you been up north?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Six months.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Can’t be. Too keen a sense of this place in
your pictures.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Six months this time. I was born in the
Aleutians.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Your people Alaskan?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: My dad was a Navy doctor.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Knew you had no native blood, even with
your dark hair. Blue eyes give you away. My wife had blue eyes.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Had?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Had some good years. Met her in ’66. She
showed up one day in Coldfoot. No one knew her. One Sunday morning, she
marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the
highest bidder. Didn’t work out in three months, she’d return the money
and leave, no hard feelings. My bid was eight thousand dollars.
Beautiful girl.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: How did she..?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I was gone, in September, laying traplines.
She went to our cache for some meat. Got mauled by a bear. Tore open her
skull. -more-</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: What about you – why come back? Classy girl
like you seems more suited to the finer things.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: That’s why I left, moved to Washington.
When I met Eric I was doing day shoots – products and fashion, mostly.
Pretty dull. Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with
Northland Oil. We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into
funding some wilderness photography… and here I am.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You should know something.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: I don’t want to talk any more.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Wasn’t my intention to hurt Wilder. I’m
telling you the truth. I liked the man. I only meant to get loose… to
survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that. Listen, I’ve
got some money put away –</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: – Don’t ever think you can buy Eric off,
Mr. Corbett –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – Cheechako?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Outsider.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Maybe you should drive him into Devil’s
Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I’ll be back
by dinnertime.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Be careful, okay?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: That’s my line.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Aim for the tires!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Let me out and keep going. They catch us,
they’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: They’ll still catch us. All you’re doing is
pissing them off.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Get in. We can jump it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How the hell were they smart enough to find
us?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Smart? Sure. That’s why I’m sitting in this
plane and they’re down there blowing me kisses.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Been driving long?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I needed a pilot’s license to take the job
here, so I got one in six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: That makes the flight more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: See the blood? Pack of wolves took down a
moose. Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches. I’d kill the last wolf on
earth, right in front of the President of the U.S. Stinking, cowardly
predator, the wolf.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Sounds like professional jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.
Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams. I’d always go with
Mitchell. Good man, Mitchell. I’d let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.
We’d hire a plane in October. On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere,
we’d drop supplies. We’d land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few
days before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: The idea was to get to the supplies before
the bears did. Along the route we’d set our traps. Made our year’s
living in three months.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Lot of times we didn’t even have a landing
strip. We’d set down on a plateau, like that one there. Yeah, that one’s
easy; you could glide right in…</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Hope you got your money’s worth on those
lessons.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stay put!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You got the belly to look me in the eye and
pull the trigger?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Be no different than shooting a rabid dog.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Next time you want to kill yourself, don’t
include me.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I took the odds on getting down in one
piece, and I made it. Now we’re in my territory.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: With light clothing and no supplies, this is
nobody’s territory.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls
who read about survival in a magazine. Fuck you. You won’t make it off
this mountain.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’m not gonna carry you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’s right. You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Look, take these cuffs off. We need to work
together.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Last time I checked the flight plan, we were
forty miles northeast of Devil’s Cauldron. Southwest is that way. No
sense waiting for a goddamn taxi.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It’ll be interesting, trying to build a fire
without any wood.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Welcome to the environment, Mr. Ecology.
Out here, one mistake is all you get.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Why in hell you care enough about me to die
taking me in?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t plan on dying.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’ll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Snow shelter. Okay. You dig. I’ll have a
little sit-down.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Even in the drifts, this snow’s too powdery
to make a shelter. When you’re done jerking around, reach down the back
of my coat.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Still quite a hike to Devil’s Cauldron.
Days. A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend. You can hide behind
that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze
–</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Ice is too thin – you can see the water
moving underneath.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’re not sitting here ’til November. There’s
a cargo plane coming to Devil’s Cauldron in four days, and I’m putting
you on it.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple
hours.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’ve been on ice like this when I was a kid,
skating. Spread your weight, keep moving. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Wait ’til I’m across!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Most dangerous thing in the world: A
regular Joe, in over his head. You trying to prove how tough you are for
me, or for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It wasn’t my idea to crash the plane.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Let’s camp. There’s grayling under this
ice. I’ll snare some for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’ve got another two hours of daylight.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Pushing it is flat wrong. All you prove is
your ignorance about breaking trail.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: I’ve been trying to raise you on the
shortwave for two days.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Have you talked to Eric?</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: I have not, but I very much want to. What
do you know about the trouble in Devil’s Cauldron?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: I was hoping you had some news –</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: – Get this straight: I’m the District
Supervisor. Whatever you do reflects on me. It wasn’t my idea to bring
you people up here, but I’m stuck with you. You are absolutely not to
involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you
alienate the other. Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.
People admire him –</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: – Corbett’s a killer.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: I don’t care if Ben Corbett makes
meatloaf out of nuns and babies, he’s not your concern. Understood?</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: The radio’s on the fritz.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Where’d you say Eric is?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Somewhere along the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam
Wilder? I heard he was in the middle of this mess.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Sam? We haven’t seen him.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Really. I thought maybe that was his
snowmobile outside. By the way – your truck also ‘on the fritz?’</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: It’s out by the pumping station, shot
full of holes.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Still nothing to tell me? Suit
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Have to backtrack, find another way
down.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Forget it. It would take days.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Going to be a bit of a challenge with
handcuffs on.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Better get into those trees before that
squall blows down.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You talk about ecology – there it is.</p>
<p><strong>miner #1</strong>: Where’s Ben at?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You’ll want to hear about it with a drink
in your mitt.</p>
<p><strong>miner #1</strong>: …Figures, Corbett getting hauled off by a
Federal marshal. God almighty, how I hate the U.S. government.</p>
<p><strong>logger</strong>: We should pass a hat. Send Corbett a few
bucks. We owe him.</p>
<p><strong>miner #1</strong>: Government and business. They ruined this
state. Like that little weasel, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>woman cat driver</strong>: ‘People’s Friend,’ my lily-white
-more-</p>
<p><strong>logger</strong>: Hold it. Meyerling told me that stuff’s
nothing but P.R. for the TV and papers down in Juneau.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: He’s full of shit. We got run out of there
by some fuckhead driving a Northland truck.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when
Ben is standing trial. They don’t know shit about Ben or Wilder!</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: It’s a three-hour flight. They shoulda
got there yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Maybe they went back to Devil’s
Cauldron.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in
town.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: That plane might’ve been to throw us off
the track. Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo
and his truck?</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Wilder still woulda made Fairbanks by now.
Fuck a duck! Ben musta got loose.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Okay, let’s backtrack, try to pick up
his trail. You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder’s buddies
with?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: We were just talking about him.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Just gather birch. It’ll smoke like hell,
but it’ll burn green.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I need your pocket knife. I have to eat,
too.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Damn lucky this storm didn’t blow down when
we were on those baldheaded mountains. It continues, we better stay
put.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It could blow over tomorrow, too.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’m still figuring: You’re either real
brave or real dumb.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I just want this over with.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You know Meyerling?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Sure. The People’s Friend. Kiss your ass
with precision if there’s a vote in it.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Always eat your meat raw when the weather’s
cold. Does you more good, long as the entrails look clean.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’ll hold onto that.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Sure love to know where you fit in up
here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m here to do my job.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You want to fool yourself about that
bullshit job, fine. Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.
You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man
-more-</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t fucking insult me.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Folks come to Alaska for a real short list
of reasons: Money. Adventure. Solitude. Those cover most everyone. But
frontiers also draw another type of man. One with a demon in his gut. He
comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to
rest.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Yep. Sometimes they do, but usually they
end up crazy or dead.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: …This is “Tundra Topics” on KFAR. Remember,
as the nights get longer, be sure to stay on a regular sleep schedule.
The depression from the coming of winter that doctors call ‘Seasonal
Affective Disorder’ – or ‘Arctic Blue’ to us lay folk – is
preventable.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: …John Byers was hospitalized in Fairbanks
today for an infection in an abscessed tooth. Mr. Byers had a toothache
and attempted to remove the tooth himself with a pair of pliers…</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: There’s a cabin, maybe twenty miles south
of here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Too bad we’re heading west.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: There’s a snowmobile. Inside a day we could
be on the Yukon. I got money there. Remember that five thousand? Make it
ten. Be smart. Take it and walk away.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You don’t get it, do you?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Nothing personal. Just wanted to see what
you’d do.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Have to get these wet things off.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re not going to slow us down! Keep
moving!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Inside of three hours you’d be dragging my
dead carcass.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stay awake! You want to go hypothermic?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: If that means freeze my balls off, no
thanks. I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Told you I’m fine!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How many do you see?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: What?! Fuck off. Save yourself.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You don’t feel cold?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: It’s a spring day…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Wake up, goddammit! You’ve got classic
hypothermia – crankiness, fatigue, can’t feel your coldness. Worst thing
you can do is fade out.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: One more thing – this doesn’t mean we’re going
steady.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Stay still.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Where’s my ELT?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Emergency transmitter? All your gear is back
at Wilder’s.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You got one?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: It was blown up with the plane.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Too bad. We’d be out of here in a few
hours.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How? Nobody this far north monitors that
frequency until avalanche season. Besides, I’m surprised a tough guy
like you uses fancy electronics.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’m surprised a flat-ender like you knows
cold-weather remedies.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’m hungry. Go kill me some dinner.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: An appetite. Maybe you won’t die after
all.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Hate to disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: It’s about time…</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Hullo?</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Somebody left in a big hurry. Check
outside.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Grizzly sign. Looks fresh.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s Sam Wilder!</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.
If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn’t hang him up like this.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Where’s the kid?</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Who gives a husky fuck? Where’s Ben?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I should get me a job with an oil
company.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: I say we eat, torch this fuckin’ thing, and
move on.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Go easy.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Cool out. I ain’t about to get blasted.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Big mother musta wanted something real bad
in here…</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: I know in my gut he was here. First
light, we try to get scent of his trail.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Used to see the natives eating roots when I
was a kid in Nome.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Nome? I figure you’d be a whaler, coming from
there.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Told that’s what our old man was. Planned
on going to sea, me and Bob, ’til I read Jack London. Started trapping
when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears. Eight bucks for a skunk, three
for a muskrat. That was fine money.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so
you go on to bigger and better things.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You got a knack for seeing things the way
you want to see them.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Don’t judge me. You’re a joke, coming here
from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah, it is fucked up – but it’s not too late
to keep that from happening here.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: All you do is keep folks from working the
land, living like they’re meant to. You don’t understand shit! Trappers,
hunters – we’re part of the environment. Who’s protecting us? I’ve seen
plenty like you. So -more-</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What do you know about people? You live like
an animal! A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far
away from the rest of us as possible.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’m real sad you don’t approve of me.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Tell me what I should do, Professor. You
got all the answers. I shouldn’t hunt? Fine, I’ll just phone up and have
a salad delivered.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Don’t push me..!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Cowardly bastard. I’m in handcuffs and I
still scare the piss out of you.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: First you save my ass, now you want to kill
me. Make up your goddamn mind.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Wilder’s missing church services; you believe
it?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could’ve
got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: What makes you so sure my boys won’t be
waiting for us?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: They think you’re in Fairbanks. If not, they
still won’t find you before the plane comes tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Don’t bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I already have.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You don’t know how true that is.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’ll wait here until nightfall. No fire, no
tarp.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Didn’t mean it, you being a coward. You’re
a lot of things,</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Maybe…maybe not. I’ll tell you what scares me
– stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk. That’s why I want to
work on the front lines, where what I do means something. Soon as I got
here, I realized my job was bullshit. Oil company propaganda. I was
ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I’ll outsmart them, do the work
anyway. I don’t know anymore. Maybe I am fooling myself. That’s what I’m
afraid of most of all.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every
season, wondering how much longer I can go on. No ‘Home for Retired
Trappers’ that -more-</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: My wife used to go to chapel on Sundays.
See her friends, ’cause I was away so much. Should’ve been home that
day. She’d be getting dressed right about now…</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: My guess is he’s loose and heading for
Chukfoktulik. He’ll need supplies; that’s the closest settlement without
a lawman.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: I ain’t gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar
Remington behind.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: What you gonna do with it? Large bore’s
for shit on small game.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Not in the right hands it ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Thought that door was open last night…</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Quit fucking around. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: You don’t mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you
look like hell.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Have you heard anything from the girl staying
with me, Anne Marie?</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Not a damn thing. What’s going on?
Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Look, Neff, I’ve got Ben Corbett with me –</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: – Here?! Where’s Wilder?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Back at my place… he, uh, broke his leg.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: If Corbett’s men find out –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – I’m putting him on the plane to Fairbanks,
eleven tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from
me?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Corbett ruined my two-way. Go to my place on
the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I’m okay and to sit tight.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: I’ll go at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Thanks. Don’t tell anyone you saw me.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Why the smirk?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Bet I could make some money turning Ben
Corbett in. Maybe more for lettin’ him loose. I was up in my cache. Saw
the Northland man come talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: You’re out of your greedy goddamn mind.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Corbett coming here stinks of trouble. We
should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the
ass.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Stay out of it.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Talk to that good-looking girl of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You broke the radio, remember?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’m sure she’s fine. Seemed like a clever
kid.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You were real resourceful out there. Got me
thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter. So he
hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones. Gets along better
than ever. Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I liked you better frozen. You didn’t talk so
much.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You’re damn lucky, glimpsing this country
before it’s ruined, gone for good. You saw wonders you’d only dreamed
of. That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where
you came from, because you have dreamt them.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes
it’s nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has
bred the balls and brains out of you. That’s what you want out of this,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: All I want want is you in jail –</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: He saw you and Corbett come in…</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Dixie’s waiting at the infirmary. She’ll put
a splint on that injured leg.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Don’t let him fool you. Real reason he’s here
is to buy Corbett’s traps.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Okay. You can talk to him. But I’ll keep the
keys with me.</p>
<p><strong>dixie</strong>: Earl says you get discount. Twenty-five
dollar.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Look, Ben, we don’t want any trouble. The
kid’s got the key, and besides, he looks edgy enough to use that magnum
he’s carrying.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Relax. I’ll get loose in time.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Any traps you don’t want, I’ll pay cash
money.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Guess someone should use them. Open the
bottom drawer in Wilder’s desk. My kit’s in there. Might as well unload
everything.</p>
<p><strong>dixie</strong>: I wash your back for you. You will like
it.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: I hate to interrupt playtime, but why the
hell are you caught up in a local matter when I gave you express
instructions to the contrary?!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Cut the shit, Leo. I might need your help…</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: They got nice beds upstairs, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: I’m standin’ guard duty. Besides, rather
spend the room money on sloppy seconds.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: Hey, Tiger –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: …I won’t let a killer walk!</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Alleged killer.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What does this matter to you?</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: You can’t see past your lousy little
assignment, sniffing around the pipeline. The few voters there are in
this district look up to Corbett, and I’m not about to alienate
them.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I should release Corbett because you want some
votes?</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: This miserable wilderness is a state of
the union. Policy’s made here the same way as in the civilized world: at
the ballot box. That’s the beauty of it – these icebox cowboys are
living a century too late. Get them on your side, it’s like buying
Manhattan for beads. With a handful of votes you control the greatest
frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Some day these people’ll wake up, and you’ll
be the first one they’ll run out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shit… Do what you have to. So will I.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Northwest. Devil’s Cauldron.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Just stay out of my face until I’m gone!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Emergency transmitter? What happened to signal
mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Lets us watch each other’s backs over a
wide area. Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the
baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should’ve
been.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No way they’ll find you on a five-minute
signal. And no way -more-</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: They haven’t disappointed me yet.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Flashbomb, eh?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I need to rent a cabin.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: What’s the problem with Sam Wilder’s
place?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Will you rent me a cabin, or not?</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Pretty clever: If the trappers got that
signal beacon and get here in time, Sam’s is the first place they’ll
look. They may figure you’re waiting for an airplane, so you can’t stay
in the shack by the airstrip. Last place they’d expect you is on the far
side of town. I can’t afford any trouble –</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: – Here’s a hundred dollars. And if you or
anyone else will back me up on this –</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: – Forget it. And try not to bleed on my throw
rugs. Why do this?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: If you have to ask, you wouldn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Eric! Why aren’t you in Fairbanks?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Oh, Christ, sweetheart. Four days! I
thought you were dead, or worse.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You can’t stay here. Go back to the Turtle.
I’ll meet you back there in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’ll tell you everything later.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Where’s Corbett?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Here. A transport plane is due at eleven. Once
I put him on it, it’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: So what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There isn’t one, unless Corbett’s men get here
before the plane does.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Let the people here handle it. It’s
their marshal Corbett killed!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Please, Anne Marie, you being here only
complicates things.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Take the snowmobile, park it behind Wilder’s
cabin.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: I was just on my way to your ladyfriend’s, but
I guess she found you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah. Sorry I barked at you last night.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: I’m the one should be sorry… Goddamn Kenai,
always out for a score. I never should’ve let him go over there.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’d sure like that favor you offered a while
back.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn’t count on it
turning this ugly.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Bastards killed Sam, you think they won’t kill
the rest of us?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: There’ll be three, four men at the most. I
have some backup, nothing will happen.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: I’m real sorry. In a while, you’re gone from
this country. But we live here. No one wants to mix it up with those
hombres.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You don’t care enough about Sam to –</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: – Sam Wilder was my cousin. He’s why I came to
Alaska. All his letters, saying what a paradise it is. But me ending up
dead won’t do Sam a lick of good.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: You’re hurt.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Nothing broken. C’mon, we have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Could’ve told you no one would help…</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Maybe you can talk sense into your
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’re moving. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’ll catch a chill by that dumb waiter
shaft. Sit on the cot. Keep this pointed at him if I get
preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Ben? Ben Corbett?</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Look, we pull Ben’s ass out of the fire,
I’ll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: I’m right fuckin’ here with you.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Ben! Speak out before I torch every dump in
town!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Answer and I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You kill me, you sign your death warrant.
And hers.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: You hear me? Ben?</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Ease off. We do this my way.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Whoever’s holding Ben Corbett, listen to
me: we just want to know he’s okay. He is, nobody gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: They know I’m here. I don’t say something,
they’ll plow this town under. You willing to accept that
responsibility?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Say you’re okay. Tell them I’ll kill you if
they rush us.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Bob?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Relax. I got a nervous man here with a
magnum up my nose.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: You in one piece?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: I’m fine. Look forward to seeing you…</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Count on it.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Sweet-talk won’t get shit. Choose it,
asswipe – cut Corbett loose, or soon as you come outside, I put a
fuckin’ bullet through your eye!</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Snow’s to their advantage, kid. You can’t
see them, but soon as that plane comes, they’ll sure as hell know where
we’re going. Wise up. Take me to the Yukon. I’ll give you that money and
guarantee you’ll walk away.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting
outside?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: The time has passed for men like them and
me. I know it. But they’re still fighting for survival, like cornered
animals. That’s why they’ll kill you. -more-</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: He’s right about the snow. We’re
blind.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: At least your girl had the sense to jump
ship. Too bad she’s the only one small enough to fit through that dumb
waiter.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Just wait, we don’t know what this guy’s
up to. Ben’ll let us know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Your infrared camera?</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Technology in the wilderness. Only
problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’ve got an idea. We’ll have to work fast.</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: There’s what they’re waiting on!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: They’ll have to come right past us.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: When you ran off, I thought you’d keep going
’til you were back home in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: My home is here. With you.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: They’re moving toward you!</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: They’re fanning out.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Kenai’s PA – but how the fuck she seein’
us?</p>
<p><strong>viking bob</strong>: Doesn’t matter. We know where they’re
going. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: One is moving back toward the
cabins.</p>
<p><strong>dixie</strong>: Earl, it’s crazy to go out there.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: I hear someone in the spa.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: That’ll keep him out of the cold.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He’ll live.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Don’t make me shoot.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: We’re going to Sam’s cabin. You can stay
in the jail until this is over.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Want to chance it with that hog-leg? You
can’t even hold it up. Better drop me first shot, bitch, or I’ll rip
your fuckin’ lungs out.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Lookit this damn mess. Where in hell’s
Wilder?</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Dead. Trappers killed him.</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: Aw, Jesus. Told you this was trouble. What
about you, big shot? Do something. Who’s side are you on, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Hey, I thought you people loved Corbett
and his wild men!</p>
<p><strong>kenai</strong>: This shoot-’em-up shit is bad for business.
I’m sick of it.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: What about you, Neff?</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: Well… two of the trappers are down already
–</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: – One left; three of us. Let’s finish
it.</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: What about Eric Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: I’ll handle him.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Over there…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Hold it. You might hit Ben.</p>
<p><strong>lemalle</strong>: Bullshit. I hit what I’m aiming at.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Let ’em come closer first…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Glad to see you’re okay. I told LeMalle
not to shoot. Had some fine seasons, didn’t we…</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Fifteen years on the trail with this man, I
never saw him rise to anger.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Your first kill. How does it taste?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Circle, this is BMY-955. I just touched down
in Devil’s Cauldron. Nobody’s here to greet me like usual, and there’s
gunfire. I’m getting scarce.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: You can’t leave yet.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: It’s my responsibility to get this aircraft
out of here safely.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: You got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>anne marie</strong>: Leave the engines idling. Go back and
open the side door.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Nobody wants any more killings; we all
agree to that, correct? That’s good. Now, Eric, you’re gonna hand your
prisoner over to us.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: This isn’t your concern. It’s over, here
and now.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Sure, when you put a bullet in my back on
the way out. Easier for all involved.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: Not a bad idea. Face it, Ben. There’s no
room in Alaska for you any more.</p>
<p><strong>meyerling</strong>: You’re as antiquated as this shit.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Keep back.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: You’re quite a piece of work, Meyerling.
The tide changes, you ride right along with it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Neff, you know better than this…</p>
<p><strong>neff</strong>: You’re an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside;
stay out of it.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Anybody moves and I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Can you walk?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Wound’s a through-and-through. Missed my
liver, I think.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: How come you didn’t let him shoot me?</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Like I said, I’d still be up on that
mountain, frozen solid, it wasn’t for you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’ll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to
Fairbanks.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: So they can patch me up and put me in a
cage? Forget it. Meyerling’s right – I’m a dinosaur. Greedy bastards
like him, it’s their turn with this land. Put me in the woods, let me
live or die on my own.</p>
<p><strong>corbett</strong>: Look down there, tell me what any of this
matters. Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won’t
be a trace of our troubles… or us.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re wrong. Everything we do leaves its
mark. You said it yourself – there are hundred- year-old footprints in
the tundra.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Too damn crazy in this state anymore. I’m
moving back to L.A.</p>
