<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Eight the hard way! Pay the line!</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Seven a winner.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No, thanks…</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Know him?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: He just seems kind of free with that
money.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Whiskey – like you’d pour it for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Don’t you know it’s no fun to drink
alone?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Not till after the first one.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: You a stranger here?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: gulping it in one</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: On the bottle it says Rye – but the way you
take it, I don’t see what difference it makes.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Another Rye.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: You didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m a stranger everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Got a job?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Listen, soldier. I know that one, too. Got a
job, stranger? No? Why don’t you join the Army? Three meals a day, a
place to sleep, a nice warm uniform –</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: It has a little more than that.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yeah, it has one thing more, and that’s what
I could never take – It’s got Second-Lieutenants.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: If you want to make it a personal matter
–</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t make it anything, soldier. You tried
to sell something and I didn’t buy it – so why don’t you just beat
it?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: If I weren’t in uniform, I might teach you
some manners.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: If you could teach me anything, you wouldn’t
be in a uniform.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: You couldn’t be looking for trouble, could
you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I could, but I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: That’s fine, because this is one of the best
places West of the Atlantic Ocean to find it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That was my first impression.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: That Lieutenant’s a nice young boy.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t doubt it, but his mouth is too big –
like your ears.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: How is it now?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Drinking alone?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s all right – try it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s not a good habit if it makes you pick
fights.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Only with Second Lieutenants.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We like Second Lieutenants here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You see – here everybody fights, except the
Army.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I wouldn’t know –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So anyone who doesn’t like the Army –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I know what you mean, but I’m afraid I’ll
have to come back. I like the way you sing.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Okay, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s his limit.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: There’s a sucker getting hot with the dice
at Ed’s table.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well – cool him off.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Captain Iles – the Commanding Officer of
the Post.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Mr. Haven – sir.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I see you finally got here.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I seem to finally get everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Mrs. Caslon, – Mr. Haven.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: You’ve met Mr. Stellman.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: It came off beautifully. He picks a very
good fight. In fact, I think I’m still a little sore at him.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Sit down, Mr. Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: So you’re operating under sealed orders.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: All this mumbo jumbo is characteristic of the
Military Information Department.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: We use it as sparingly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I’ve been in this territory for a number of
years – and I think it might be a little rougher here than a suburb of
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Very possibly.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Then why is M.I.D. sending you out here?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Because two soldiers have been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: And they think I can’t handle that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: They merely know you haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I have only ninety-four men on the post, with
Indian trouble up north. The War Department has refused to send
reinforcements, or am I boring you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m not the War Department.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: The two soldiers were killed while escorting
one of the gold stages.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Is escorting gold a function of your
command?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Young man, the functions of my command look
very pretty on paper, but they’re not very practical in a territory like
this. Do you have any illusions about that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I have no illusions about anything.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What’s happening to the gold?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I’ve permitted it to be stored in a warehouse
on the post. Now everybody is waiting to see what I do next.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What do you do next?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Aren’t you here to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Captain, you’re in a bad way. Wells Fargo
won’t convoy gold. You tried and failed and two men are dead. The gold
is piling up on the post and you can’t move it. Your post is
under-manned. You want the Quartermaster at Platte to replace seventy
uniforms sent to the freight office at West Rim City –</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: The freight building burned down with the
uniforms! I’m not operating a fire department – and if I was, West Rim
City is sixty miles away!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That doesn’t concern me either.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: What does?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: The killing of two soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: They were my men, Haven, and I’m trying every
way I know to find out who murdered them.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: So will I.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: You’ll find it harder than you think. I don’t
know how you operate, but it’s a dangerous job that can get you
killed.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Perhaps I can get some help from the
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: You can forget him. He’s a miserable man that
somebody is using to keep the law a joke.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You make it sound very difficult. Why don’t
you just wrap up your flag and take it back East with you?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Tell me, how will I know what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ll let you know from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: That’s very obliging of you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: But I don’t want to visit the Army post.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Then report to me through Mrs. Caslon here.
You can be a friend of her husband’s. He owned the Argus mine and died
last year. If that meets your approval.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Only if it meets with hers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I’d be delighted to help.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: He really isn’t that abrupt – he –</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Goodnight, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Goodnight, George.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I think he secretly likes you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: He’s a man who can sure keep a secret.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Would you like a little sherry?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Only if you have some too.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: To your good luck.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What mine did the two soldiers try to convoy
the gold from?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: My mine – The Argus.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That brings me to a question I decided not to
ask.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Then I’ll answer it first. Captain Iles
has asked me to marry him.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can understand that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: But you can’t understand why Captain
Iles should be involved in the gold business.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I do now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: It isn’t just mine. You must realize
there’s a lot of gold from all over the territory stored at the post
warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: How much.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Perhaps as much as half a million. In
fact, I have about fifty thousand in my safe now.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who is doing all this?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I don’t know… that’s the worst part of
it… not knowing.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: pats her shoulder with casual</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Don’t get into trouble –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I know, but –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Trouble and I are old
enemies. We understand each other. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You didn’t tell me your husband’s name.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Ben.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Ben.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Evenin’ stranger.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You must know everybody in town.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Everybody but one. I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What’s your name? You seem to be a pretty
clever fellow.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Orville Weekly, and I can’t be a total
blank. I been here six years and I ain’t dead yet.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Have you got a vacant room?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Day, week, month?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t always know. And the way you talk a
man couldn’t be very sure.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Then it’s eight bucks, cash in advance.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: From Arizona, huh?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No – I always put down where I’m going next –
so I won’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Room ten – end of the hall. Make your own
bed. Furnish your own towels. Your bag’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Thanks a lot for the key. I’ll be back
later.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: How about eating alone? Is that a bad habit
too?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just when you have to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s only money. I’ve changed my mind since I
left here awhile ago. I don’t want to pick a fight – or break the bank –
or –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What changed your mind?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s what I came back to find out.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Maybe it would be better if you found
another girl.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No, it wouldn’t… I looked.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That man in ape’s clothing – could he be
Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: His eyes follow you around like a couple of
flies.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: They follow me to see that strangers don’t
annoy me.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Only strangers?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No one else would be so foolish.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: First, you’re beautiful. Then I like the way
you sing – and now you’re a woman of mystery. Champagne?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t want to be a stranger, so I’ll have
to be foolish.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You like to take chances, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: If I feel lucky.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then I’d advise you to try the dice
table.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’d rather get lucky here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Every man has a right to go to his own
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: down the champagne</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: He seems to be a lot of man.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The most in town.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s a very small town. You could get it all
in this saloon.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We usually do.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: So Charlie probably runs the town.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Why do you care?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m going to spend some time here. I want to
know who winds the clock.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s been a nice conversation. I hate to
have it end.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mick – this is – cousin John.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: From Waxahatchie.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: What’s keeping him?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I think he’s wondering if he couldn’t do
more good here.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: You aren’t very friendly, are you, mister?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: A friend to all is a friend to none.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You ought to learn not to pick ’em so easy,
like you do your cousins.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Ask her?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I never saw him before in my life.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: You’re too little to make that big a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You want to correct me or just bleed at the
mouth?</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Bring him outside.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Did you find out what he wants?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He wanted to be my cousin. Only I haven’t
any aunts or uncles. But you never know – and the least I can do is bury
him.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Mick will kill him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s ten to one.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I don’t like the other fellow’s chances,
but I’m a sucker for odds.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You should always bet on a champion. Then
you can only lose once.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: You give ten to one…? I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re down. A thousand to a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Don’t miss so much. You’ll got tired.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: He can fight a little.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A little won’t be enough.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Stand still and fight.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: You can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Nobody can do this… to me.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Somebody just did.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I can’t believe it. Mick Marion losing a
fight and me winning a thousand!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Give it to him, Prince – in chips.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Have some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: up a pitcher and a</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Cream.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: curiosity and</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: So would I…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Like a million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You just cost me a thousand. You lost your
pipe in the fight. I brought it to you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Do you always get sweet with the men who
fight over you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Only the winners.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Tell me something –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That fellow might have killed me – Where do
you bury the losers?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You talk too much.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What do you want – the next dance?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think you’d better sit this one out.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Have some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: The way you run this dump I knew you must be
good at something else.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Some call me the town poet – and some the
village idiot. Who am I to question either? How you feel today?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Like I crawled here from Kansas City.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Well, it figures to make you pretty famous.
Fact, people been askin’ for you already.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: That gold mine lady – Mrs. Caslon.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Couldn’t do better. And Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: No. less.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You seem impressed.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Why not? Charlie owns a piece of
everything, includin’ the undertaker and the sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: The stage line too?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Everything but the Wednesday Bible Class.
Even owns a piece of me. Takes your money while you’re here, and makes
you pay to leave.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: When you get the next verse I’d like to hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Can’t find no word to rhyme with Mick
Marion.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Carrion.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Of all the stupid bonehead plays! What did he
fight about – don’t tell me a woman?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: That’s what they tell me.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Who started it?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: I don’t know, but Haven finished it.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: That probably strikes you as a very admirable
thing.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Well, I don’t think so! I have men who can use
their fists. Why didn’t they send a man who could use his brains!</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Well – open it up!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Caslon.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Captain… Lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Mr. Haven, we may not have very much around
here that pleases you, but we do have a strict post regulation against
brawling in the town. Now would you like to explain what happened last
night?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I came here to return Mrs. Caslon’s call.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: This book I have in my hand is the Army
Register, 1882.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I am now going to read from it. “Haven, John
Martin, born Ohio 1852. Appointed Second Lieutenant. Promoted First
Lieutenant 20th Infantry, March 1880; reduced in rank to 2nd Lieutenant
January 12, 1881.”</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s the Army Register.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Haven, you’ve lost your rank once. It may very
well happen again.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: To almost anybody.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Maybe if you’d let him explain… He
might have a good reason.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Even a bad reason would delight me.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What would you like to know?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Did you pick that fight?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Those things can become very vague.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: And where do you expect all this to get
you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That is a question I prefer not to
answer.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I think you’re trying to carry your authority
too far.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Perhaps, but there’s one thing, Captain Iles…
We had an arrangement that we wouldn’t meet – you and I – except through
Mrs. Caslon… I think it’s important to keep it that way… And I like it
better.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Doesn’t he ever stop playing?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Sam? It don’t bother him. He’s deaf.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where do I find the boss?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: First door top of the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Mick been around?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: He’s undisposed.</p>
<p><strong>prince’s voice</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: They said Charlie –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You’re Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s right. This is Prince. Don’t ever
gamble with him.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You mean with his equipment?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: She means either. See you later,
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You surround yourself with very affable
characters.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It makes me feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You’re not that sinister. Last night with the
wet towels you were Florence Nightingale in silk stockings. Have you got
a match?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: There’s one in my pocket but I hate to reach
for it… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sit there.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Now you’re Florence Nightingale again.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why did you pick that fight?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You could have insisted I was your
cousin.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Perhaps that isn’t the way I felt about
you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where did you get the name of Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It was my father’s. My name is Charlene,
but –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I like that better… Charlene… This’ll be the
first time I ever worked for a woman.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What makes you think you’re going to work
for me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You sent for me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right, I sent for you. I was doing a
nice quiet business. That was because everybody was afraid of Mick. Now
every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged he’ll try to do
what you did.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: But they will.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s not the job I want. I don’t intend to
start at the bottom. I’ve been there. It’s too crowded.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where do you want to start?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: With the money.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And what will you do for it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Anything – except hang. How did you get – all
this?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I learned one thing from my father. As long
as men think they can beat the tables, all you have to do is get a
table. Sometimes they run out of cash and I find myself with new
responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Such as –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A couple of stores for one thing.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can’t see myself behind a counter.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A sawmill, and a logging camp. The logging
camp’s a long way from town.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I own the stage line from here to West Rim
City, but that’s a dud.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Outlaws. The money was in gold shipments.
Now the mines won’t ship it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ll take that job.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You mean ride shot-gun?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I mean run the line.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t force your luck. You won a fight last
night. You could lose one tonight.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Today I’d hate to tangle with a
butterfly.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you think you’ll get out of running
the stage line?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: A commission on all the gold I get
through.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That should buy you a small beer.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Glad to get it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s pretty dangerous. Even Wells Fargo
locked up their station and quit trying.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who steals the gold?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who doesn’t? All they have to do is put a
mask on and they all look like Black Bart.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Give me a letter of authorization.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I can’t bet against you twice, can</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know I forgot to ask you one thing.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m working for you now. You can ask me
anything.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How do I know I can trust you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You don’t.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Can I?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Only with money.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Okay, boss?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Are you the manager?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: My name’s Haven.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’ve heard about you. You’re the fellah who
took Mick Marion apart. Almost knocked me off my feet. But my feet ain’t
been any good since I followed Stonewall Jackson. What business you got
with me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m the new boss.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re not fired.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I got to be. There ain’t enough work around
here for one man, let alone two.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Two can loaf as easy as one.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Mr. Leonard!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Talk to him. He just took the reins. This
is Jim Goddard. He’s a regular stage driver. Jerry here runs freight to
the sawmill. Boys, your new boss.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Hello, boys.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I gotta start out of here for the sawmill
before daybreak. Is that all right, Mr. Haven?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I seen that fight last night. It was sure a
beauty.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Glad you enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What I liked was the way you –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Let’s not talk about it. Right now it hurts
my hands to listen.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: My last run. I stopped a bullet.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Did you get a look at them?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: I wish I had.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I think I’m going to need you and not on one
leg. So sit down and give it a rest.</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m coming back later and sit behind your
desk. I’ll need the keys.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Only things here that work.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Son, I waste my time. I might as well waste
some advice. You’re full of blood and vinegar, but this whole thing has
got something wrong with it. Goddard only got nicked in the shin. You
might not be so lucky…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I might depend on something besides luck.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Like for instance?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Well the fact that they don’t seem to shoot
too straight.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: They don’t need to when they shoot so
often.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Worry it over.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>colored boy</strong>: Sumpin’, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>colored boy</strong>: Miss Charlie, Mr. Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where do you drive her?</p>
<p><strong>colored boy</strong>: Same places. Around the hills, down the
river, every afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I think I’ll give you this afternoon off.</p>
<p><strong>colored boy</strong>: I shouldn’t let you do this, suh… But
ah am.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Does this Haven move me out? Is that the
plan?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Prince, you know I wouldn’t part with
you.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: But I always come up empty.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not quite empty. I gave you what is
probably the one honest feeling you ever had in your life.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I keep forgetting that. Pardon me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s the matter, Prince?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I don’t like John Haven or anything about
him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’ve said that.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What do you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You want me to have him looked up in the
Social Register?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: A man walks in out of nowhere –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And went against your table. Did he play
like a gambler?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: He knew something.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes – and he took Mick.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: So he can fight. You like that part, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll tell you one thing, Prince, I don’t
like this part.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Stand there a second.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Every time I see you, you look different, but
you always look beautiful. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I always have somebody to lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Take my hand – But don’t squeeze it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tell me what you’re doing with my
buggy.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: My work. I’m the new transportation boss. You
hired me.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I presume you’re going shopping?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I wouldn’t wear anything sold this side of
Chicago. I’m going to call on a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: At this hour?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: His name is Mark Bristow – and any hour, it
would be strictly business.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: The way you say it – he may need a
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s a lawyer himself, but it won’t help
him.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What good is a lawyer if he never gets in a
court?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Like a doctor in a graveyard. Where is this
unlucky man?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Across the street.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Shall I take the horses back and rub them
down?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Do you think they’ve gone far enough?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then maybe you better wait and come with
me.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I wonder if you’d do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Why, surely.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s a big favor, and I wouldn’t blame you if
you refused.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I want to haul some gold from your mine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: That IS a big favor.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I know it seems impossible to you, but that’s
one reason why I’m here – to find cut what makes it impossible.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Isn’t that very risky?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s why I couldn’t go to anyone but
you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I’m just wondering if we shouldn’t
speak to Captain Iles first.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You know what he’d say. He’d advise against
it – but if it works my way, it may clear everything up – for all of us
– and for Iles too. The War Department doesn’t like all that gold around
an Army Post.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: We’re working too much in the dark. This may
be the only way to see something. It’s a risk – but someone has to take
it…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Who else will know of it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Just us. That’ll be all who know – and that’s
the idea.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I’ll arrange it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Don’t look so grim. It’s only your gold and
my skin. And smile when you walk away as though we’d been talking about
what a dry summer it’s been.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: …You know I’ll always cooperate – as much
as possible. But I haven’t the money.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: the desk with a sheaf of papers, which
she</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Your credit’s over, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: My luck can turn, can’t it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not on my tables.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I’ve seen other people fall in this trap –
but I didn’t think it would get me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nobody does. I’ll have Prince drop in and
go over your books. Maybe we can work something out.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: But I told you –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s the way it is, Mark. I pay off on
the line and I expect to get paid. Give it some thought.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You know, you remind me a little – back there
– of a character I once read in a book.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I had an idea you’d read a book. What was
the character?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Simon Legree.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mark is mixed up. He’s either crooked
without being smart, or honest without being lucky. And that’s no
good.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t think I’d want to owe you money –
even if I was honest.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Even?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: When I was seven I robbed my own piggy
bank.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s hard to imagine you being seven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I was very fat and ate a lot of candy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Is that why you robbed your bank?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No… I robbed it to run away from home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yeah, but I had to go back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It got dark.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is my favorite place in the world… I
always come here to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The rook here and the stream. The stream is
always running away and the rock is always watching it go. It’s two ways
to be – and I always wonder which is the best.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: They probably envy each other.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Do you suppose any woman could envy me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: But not a good woman?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Nobody is any good. You mean respectable.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Respectable people are very useful – but they
bore me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: With certain exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Like who?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Like Mary Caslon…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I thought we might get to that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How did you happen to know her?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I knew her husband.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s curious, considering –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Considering what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ben Caslon was a very upright citizen.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Meaning I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She’s certainly not hard to look at – and
now she has the money and is – – also very respectable.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Then why would she be interested in me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Because you’re no good. And good women like
men who are bad for them.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Flattery will get you nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Fooling with her will get you nowhere too –
except in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: With whom?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: The army. Why is it you’re always getting
mixed up with the army?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What are the odds I hit the leaf?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Four to one.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Pass – What’s the army got to do with
Mrs. Caslon?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She’s engaged to Captain Iles.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Iles?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s the army boss here.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: If you’re going to frighten me, the least you
can do is hold my hand.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: This is where you ought to slip – and I
should catch you and kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No chance.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You finish that song?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Never do.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: It’s my fatality. I never finish
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Maybe it’s just as well.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Maybe so. I thought I’d tell you. Goin’
back to your room will be a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It will?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: I don’t know what happened on that buggy
ride, but somebody came and took all your truck.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: And, naturally, you didn’t do anything about
it?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: What could I do?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You could have called the sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Set a thief to catch a thief, eh?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I paid my rent and I think I’m entitled to
know who stole my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: A man couldn’t ask for no prettier
thief.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hello… I’ve been wondering where you
were.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I lost my shirt.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You didn’t imagine that I’d let you live in
that hotel, did you? I want you available – in case of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where did I move?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: In a very nice room upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: When can you get my things back to the hotel,
Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why don’t you take them yourself?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Because that’s not how they got here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re really hard – aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You have to play everything alone?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: This hotel is no good. The service is bad.
The clerk’s a poet, and the mattress is not quite as soft as a marble
slab. But I’m beginning to like it… and if I open this window, and hear
you singing…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Is that the way you want it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s the way.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: They’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What brings you here?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: I had a dream.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: That you’d be back here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: Maybe because you took the keys.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Don’t they go with the job?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: You know how it is with dreams. I got the
crazy idea you were going to try something –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: How crazy?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: Like running a shipment.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: I wanted to be some help with it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: All right – you’ve been some help. Now you
can go back to sleep and I’ll finish the dream for you.</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: I’m riding with you, Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: I’m riding.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You got more than your leg hurt, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: Maybe I just like to ride in the moonlight
if nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: And if it does?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: Then I think I got a little better right
than you to be there.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I was just thinking – a nice guy like you
probably has a nice girl somewhere – or a wife.</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: What are we gonna do – have a little chat
about women?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Some other time – Let’s go – out the back
gate.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What makes you so anxious to take this
chance?</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: What makes you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m on commission. With me it’s a matter of
money.</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: And you think it’s something else with
me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can’t think of anything else – except
curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>goddard</strong>: Some moonlight after all…</p>
<p><strong>bandit</strong>: All right – stretch!</p>
<p><strong>second bandit</strong>: Pile out with the hands up.</p>
<p><strong>first bandit</strong>: Get down.</p>
<p><strong>first bandit</strong>: Turn around and keep ’em high.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Take it easy. They hang you just the
same.</p>
<p><strong>second bandit</strong>: You, Goddard, start walking.</p>
<p><strong>second bandit’s voice</strong>: That’s far enough.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You’re a goner, brother – you can talk.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where’s Joe? Something’s gone wrong, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I know one thing. He was born on a horse and
he didn’t just fall off this one… go and take a look.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hello there, Mr. Haven!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Hello, Jerry. What’s the haul?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: This is that load of grub for the
sawmill.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Want to ride my horse back to town?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What about the wagon here?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ll finish the haul.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re the boss.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Any excitement in town?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t know, Mr. Haven. I left before
daybreak.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Take him easy. He’s tired.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ll give him a good rubdown.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You see a rider comin’ up?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Haven’t even seen a lizard. Where do I put
this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Where did you put it before?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I never did. I’m a new driver. I think it’s
grub.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Take it to the cook shack.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You the cook?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Nah. I just wear this hat to keep the flies
out of my hair.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It don’t matter to me, brother. I just haul
this grub. I’d just as soon haul it back.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Take it next door.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No sign of Joe. But there’s the tracks of
another horse, circling the mill and coming back on the road just
north.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Let’s go and look at this guy again.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You sure you didn’t see no rider?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Look – you want me to say I saw a rider? I’ll
say it. I’ll say I saw a ghost. It don’t make any difference to me.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: When did you get this job?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s the system. If I don’t work I don’t eat.
I never been able to find any way to beat it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who hired you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Mr. Haven.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: The guy that had the fight?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Same fellow.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: This Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Any man who gives me a job is my friend.
Look, I’m working, I haul this stuff out here. Nobody wants to tell me
where to dump it. Everybody wants to know what I’m doin’ and what I
haven’t seen. I don’t know. I get thirty cents an hour. How smart does
that have to make me?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Don’t get hot.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I ain’t hot. I’m just mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Forget it. I got a load for you to take back
when you’re done here.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: How soon?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Well, I haven’t eaten anything but dust since
sun-up.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: All right – grab it quick. Work on this
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We risk him, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He don’t look right to me.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He don’t look any worse than the rest of it
looks right now. Come on, get this junk out.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: How about a handout?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You cook pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: I ought to. I used to cook for six hundred men
a day.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where was that?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Leavenworth.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: This used to be my mother’s special dish. She
made it right out of the world.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: My old woman couldn’t boil a potato.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who’s boss around here?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I mean the whole works.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: You talked to the man when you came in.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Real tough-looking fellah.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: They’re all tough till they get to Mick
Marion.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Mick come out here?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Last night – and he looked like somebody got
to him.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Face all beat up – Like your knuckles.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I had bad luck with a crate of
cauliflower.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: That’s what he brought down here – a
cauliflower face. You fight him?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Mick? Do I look like I would?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Just the knuckles.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hurry it up, driver!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Comin’.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Not many of the hands here, are there?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: All up at the logging camp.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Much obliged. That was real fine
mulligan.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe this isn’t such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who said it was? I just want that gold outa
here the easiest and quickest way.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You see this box?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It goes to Prince. Know who Prince is?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He runs things for Charlie. Know who Charlie
is?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: One thing…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That’s a gear box you’re hauling back and it’s
got to be repaired. And you tell Charlie that if it ain’t repaired we
might have to shut down quick. You got that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: All right – then get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Well – what have you found out?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Goddard’s body – shot in the back.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: And no sign of Haven?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: One horse was missing. They might have
taken him away on that. They wouldn’t kidnap him if they’d killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Why would they kill Goddard?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: He was a Wells Fargo Detective.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I see… he was a man they couldn’t handle, so
they shot him. But Haven wasn’t killed.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: He may have followed them on the missing
horse.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: And he may be fishing for trout in the Verde
River. Why do I always learn everything last? Why must everything be
common gossip by the time it reaches me?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Neither do I, but I’ll find out. The Army
didn’t banish me out here to set up a listening post. Bring the man in,
dead or alive. If he’s alive, arrest him.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: But can you arrest him?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: No, but I can take any living human being into
custody – or am I mistaken in this too?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Then go and do it!</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Draw those blinds, Bristow.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: All right – light it up.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Can’t you put that firearm away.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can – but it quiets my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Drink?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: We’d given you up for dead – we –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Why, everybody. They found Goddard’s boy –
didn’t you know that? What happened? Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m glad you got your voice back.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: If you’re trying to imply that you
frightened me, coming here like this, you’re right. I’m neither a hero
nor a fool. They killed Goddard – Why didn’t they kill you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Somebody must have wanted me saved.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe a rainy day. Only it
might never rain.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: And what do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m going to make a statement, which you will
write and notarize.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yes – except that you put it away where it
can’t be stolen or tampered with.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I have a safe –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can see you have.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Meaning you don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I do – but I don’t think you trust
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Where do you want it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Mrs. Caslon has a safe – a nice fat one.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I think I can arrange it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: All right – here’s the statement.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I solemnly swear that on Thursday last, about
eleven p.m. the stagecoach in which I was riding was held up by five
armed bandits. The gold I was hauling was stolen and James Goddard, the
guard, was murdered in cold blood.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I trailed the bandits, caught up with one and
– killed him.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Put it down. I then followed the horses
bearing the gold to a sawmill –</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: You sure it was Haven you met?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t I know my own boss?</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Go in and get a beer.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: …After I left there, I opened the crate. The
gold was in it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What did you do about the gold?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I came to the conclusion that I finally had
enough money to need a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Have you seen the sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ve heard about him, and I still came to
you.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I see. Well, as a lawyer, my advice would
be –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I didn’t come here for advice.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I’m wondering what you get out of this.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It makes me more valuable to somebody alive
than dead.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t know… yet.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Now I’m wondering what I get out of it.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: They been here lookin’ for you, the
men.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I thought they might.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: I told them you was out.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I was. I just came in the back way.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You finish that song?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: I had her finished, but what good is it? It
was about your death.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Keep it a couple of days – may be you can
still use it.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Good evening, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Any news about Haven in town?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I just saw Haven.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Alive?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Very much.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Good evening, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Good evening, George.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I just passed Bristow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Why don’t you sit down. You look
tired.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I should.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I suppose you’ve heard the news. The
holdup and poor Jim Goddard.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I heard it – last, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Why don’t you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: crossing to light</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: The gold Haven tried to run was from
the Argus, darling</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: It was? Yours!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Now don’t excite yourself.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I am very calm, and I calmly ask you how you
could allow that scoundrel to transport gold from your mine when –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: The man you call a scoundrel may be
dead at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: And he may be in town at this moment – where,
in fact, he is. How you could do this without telling me –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I only did it for your sake.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: MY sake?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: After all, Mr. Haven represents the
U.S. Government.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Who do you think I represent?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I told you, George, I was only trying
to help you.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: And while we’re on the subject, who does Mark
Bristow represent?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: You know perfectly well that he’s my
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I know perfectly well he’s a scoundrel too. Is
he also trying to help me?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Thank you, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I’m sorry. I’d say that I lost my head if I
believed that I had one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: It’s my fault George. Mark left me
something.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: You’re not going to open it?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: To whom it may concern. That’s what it says
here. Well, it may concern me.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: It does.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: My business isn’t jammed up enough – so they
send this harebrained demoted lieutenant pry around in it… They want to
help me too.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: George – you’re getting to be a hard
man to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I’m getting to deal with some hard men.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: You certainly are a careful man.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I have to be. I live a careless life.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What about the deposition?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: She has it. It’s in her safe.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: We call on Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: It’s a dangerous play, Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What if she doesn’t believe you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Then she’ll have to believe you.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: That deposition could be a lie. It might
not stand up in a court.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You’re sure of that?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Well – not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s it. You’re a lawyer and you’re not
sure. Then how can she gamble on it, either?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Because she’s a gambler.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No, she isn’t. We’re the gamblers, Mark.
Lot’s go.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You’re under arrest!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: For the murder of James Goddard – and
robbery under arms!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ve heard about you. You don’t appear to
understand the functions of your office. You’ve missed the whole point
of your profession. Even your gun isn’t loaded. I suggest that you start
all over again, with this point in mind: the duty of a peace officer is
to arrest the culprit of a crime – not the victim.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Rye?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: This is no good.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: The bourbon is just as bad.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I don’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You want to leave?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I just don’t like it. I’m a nervous man.
Something’s going to happen. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Then why don’t we do something.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: We’re doing something.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Charlie wants to see you. Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Do I go with you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Can you make it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I see you found the difference.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Looks like a board meeting.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s he doing with you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I thought I might need a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can realize how seldom legal technicalities
annoy you – but I have one that might. Besides, he knows all about
it.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: About a gear box I failed to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I don’t know anything! I merely –</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Mark is right. He doesn’t know anything. He
just knows what I dictated to him in a deposition.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And what was that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It was just a story. About a man who got
murdered, a thief who got shot, and a gear box that got lost. Probably
nobody would believe it – …unless I got killed for it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Go downstairs, Pete. Watch the
stairway.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who else have you told?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No one. Mark I had to have. He’s a witness
and a notary. He makes it stick. He stands it up in court.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What keeps it from getting to a court?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: A cut.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: He’s running a bluff!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I ran one on you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You brought your lawyer. Ask him if this
doesn’t sound like blackmail.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: He can’t think very clearly in the presence
of a gun.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: But it doesn’t bother you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No, it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What you want is money.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t see how going to the law will get
it for you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: If you did see how, I’d never get there,
would I?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: So it boils down to this: we can make a deal,
and all be happy together.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Not as long as you always have something on
us.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Unless you also have something on me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And how would that be?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: When I deliver the gold to you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You mean the gear box?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can even forget I looked inside. So I stole
a gear box… I’m still a thief.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What does he get?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: He gets even with you.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Have you lost your mind!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It was all right when he lost his money.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right… I’ll give him the IOU’s… when
the gear box is delivered.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You don’t realize how important it is when a
piece of machinery breaks down. It could close the entire sawmill.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I guess I didn’t realize it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can stay.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I think she was talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You roll nice dice and you bet them jamb up,
but some day you’ll slip. And when you do, I’ll be around to catch
you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You know, I think he will.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then you should be more careful.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: The poorhouses are filled with careful men…
…And so are the graveyards.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You’ve got a nice perfume.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Carnation. I almost had to have you killed.
I’d have hated it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: So would I.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’d have missed you… too much.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: And too long.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did you ever tell a woman you loved
her?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: All of them.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How did you get away?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I was always in the doorway when I said
it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You never said it to me.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Let’s go over to the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I seem to always end up like this with you.
I take you for granted. You like it that way. It goes with loaded dice
and crimped cards and fixed wheels.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Isn’t that your business.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It isn’t my life.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You told me once you might be a missionary
on your way to China. And that’s as much as I’ve ever found out about
you. You’re working for me, but for all I know you could be working for
somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Like Goddard?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I think I better bring you that gold.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re still recruiting?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Yes, we still want you. But this is a
little different.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: And how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Captain Iles has asked me to take you into
custody, Haven.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You heard the man.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Best thing for you is to come along,
Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s what I like – the best thing for
me.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Very friendly with everybody – isn’t he?
Wells Fargo detectives, and now the Army. How far can he go?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Exactly where he’s headed now – to
jail.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: The Quartermaster at Platte wants three
sworn statements before he’ll replace those seventy uniforms, sir.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Three sworn statements! I told him all I know.
They were in the freight office at West Rim City. The building burned
down.. .you sure he doesn’t want me to send him the ashes too? All
right, have Stamm fix the papers.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Nice to see you alive.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Dumb luck.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: You seem to have been living quite an
adventurous life.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Is that why I’m under arrest?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: That’s indefinite. I wanted to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: If you consult the Army Blue Book it might
enable you to be more definite.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Curiously enough, you got me into the habit of
reading myself. You’re quite right about The Blue Book – UNLESS that
officer should get himself about one-half as far out of line as you
have!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: How far is that?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Right here in your own statement!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I see you did what I expected.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: You’ve gotten a man killed and Mrs. Caslon’s
gold stolen. Is that far enough?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Haven – as far as I’m concerned, this
deposition is good enough for me. I want these people arrested. This is
all the evidence we need.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I need more.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: For what reason?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: For the reason I came here… to get the
murderers of two soldiers – not to save somebody’s gold. That’s a
mistake you made. I still don’t know who killed them, but I’m going to
find out. And when the net is hauled in, they’re all going to be in it.
That’s my fish – and you can have the minnows.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: When are you returning Mrs. Caslon’s gold?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s a matter between myself and
Mrs. Caslon.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I don’t particularly like you – but I see no
reason why you should get yourself deliberately killed.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It won’t be deliberate.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: What difference does it make how you get
killed? Where does it leave me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Where does it leave me?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Understand this, Haven. You’re heading for bad
trouble – and when it comes don’t expect any help from me. Is that
clear?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: From the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>stellman</strong>: Anything else, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Yes, three cigars, a pint of whiskey, and a
copy of that confounded Blue Book.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What’s the good word?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: For you it’s not good. You’re in bad
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I don’t know how you can know so much and
move so little. I think I’ll try it myself.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Want to leave a call?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s very nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: What time?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: When you’re sure everybody in town is in bed
– call me. And if anybody asks for me – I went to jail.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Turn around with your hands up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: All right – put it in the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Is this a hold-up?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: You want to put it in the wagon?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Now was there something you wanted to
say?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I trailed one of the bandits here where they
cached it. I couldn’t haul it on horseback, so I came here with the
wagon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I know that’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Some of it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: But not nearly enough.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ll try it again. I cached it here myself. I
was going to turn it over to them. I wanted to buy a membership in their
club. This was the initiation fee.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Fifty thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Well, you see, I thought it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Well, you see, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What you’re doing may get me into serious
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: If you’re still in town in twenty- four
hours, I promise what I do may get you hanged.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I thought you were in jail.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I talked my way out.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re a very glib man. You seem to talk
your way out of everything.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Up to a certain point.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: A gun. Champagne.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Are we celebrating something?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You know, the first time I talked to you we
had champagne. I think I should have been a missionary and gone to China
after all.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Didn’t you bring me something?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: But you will?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No – just like that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s easy to explain. It’s just a little hard
to believe.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Make it as credible as you can.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can’t. I went to get it, and it was there.
But so was somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Mrs. Caslon.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No… she had a gun with her.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Did you have one too?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: The one she had was in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: This could be that slip you mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So this nice lady held you up and took the
gold, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s like saying I got robbed at Sunday
school. It’s no good, is it?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No, it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I even had to walk back to town. I think that
may be one of the longest walks I ever took.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: And one of the last.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Mick might have killed you, but you fought
him with your fists. The sheriff had a gun but you took it away from
him. Ben had a gun last night but it didn’t seem to scare you. Now this
genteol petticoat waves a pistol and you run for your life.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: wineglass, glancing</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Or I make it sound like what it is: a
lie!</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: My word doesn’t seem very good around
here.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You’ve only got one thing left that’s any
good here - and that’s some gold.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Is that all I’ve got?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not quite. You’ve got some time. You’ve got
two hours to get it here.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You want me to fatten you up before you kill
me? Is that what you mean?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I said what I meant – two hours.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I once knew a guy who stole a dime tip from a
lunch counter and parlayed it into fifty thousand. I might try that –
but not in two hours.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You’re sweet.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I’ve been looking for you. Where have you
been?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I took a walk in the country.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Did you get it for her?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: But that was the deal. You agreed to –</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: If you’re trying to pull something –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You want to listen?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I can’t deliver it because I no longer have
it. It was taken away from me by Mrs. Caslon. I’ve told Charlie, and
she’s very unhappy. I have two hours to produce the loot. You haven’t
any idea where a man could raise fifty thousand quickly, have you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I thought not.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What are you going to do…?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Nothing, Mark. The boat just sailed.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You’ll have to think of something very
good.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I can think of something.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead and do it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Everything ready?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: All set.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Got enough men at the sawmill?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Plenty.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: All right. Go back out there and get them
into the uniforms. We’ll hit the post just before midnight.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I don’t know what we’re waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I gave him some time. He’s in the hotel.
He’s not doing anything. I gave him some time. I don’t care what he does
with it.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: And I don’t care when, but I’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bristow’s here.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: This should be good.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let him in.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You want the I.O.U’s?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: You mean –</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Why? Did Haven –</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: No, he didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Then I don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: We don’t think they’re going to be any
good.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I didn’t have anything to do with it. All I
did was write it. I’m not in on this. I can still make them good. Or I
can –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I can do business. I got it somewhere. I –
Here – take a look at this – the deposition – The only copy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let’s have it.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Nothing. I just want to get out of it. I
never had any part of it. This ought to prove that!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: It’s – it’s a trick. I – I’ll see about
this! He can’t do this to me! I’ll go and see about this!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sure, you see about it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Take this along.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: Something left to wait for?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>mark’s voice</strong>: It’s me – Bristow – let me in.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You going to shoot me, Mark?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: You double crossed me, Haven.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: I got the deposition back. I took it to
them.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: It wasn’t there! It was a piece of blank
paper!</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Don’t you laugh at me! I ought to kill
you!</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: They want you to, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: And it may be your only out, if you do. But I
doubt it. You know why? Because even if you took them my scalp, it
wouldn’t buy your life. You’re in debt and you’re broke and you’re
scared – and you know far too much. There isn’t any way they use you –
alive. Can you think of one?</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: They’re going to do it. I know it. They’re
going to kill me – Why do they have to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Us, Mark…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: This must be hers.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: She’s sweet.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: There’s one thing, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: There is?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You might get out of town.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: There isn’t a chance in a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: If there’s one in a million, it’s the only
one you have.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Yes – we might get away with it. We
might…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I have to stay.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: But you can’t stay. You said yourself –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: If you must do this, go straight to your
horse. Don’t stop for anything.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: – I’ve got a lot of important papers –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You haven’t got anything important left, Mark
– except your life, and very little time to keep it. You do it very fast
and you might be lucky.</p>
<p><strong>bristow</strong>: Yes. I might be. I’ll try it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You didn’t throw away that verse?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You won’t have to change it much.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: You ain’t going out there with that?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Not much, is it?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: You’ll never get closer to having nothin’
–</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No – I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Say –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yeh?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: I’m naturally sentimental, bein’ a sort of
poet.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: I keep a bunch of gimeracks – an oldtime
sheriff’s gun, a bullet from a dead bandit, a rosary from some guy they
hanged.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: That’s nice. A hobby?</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: In a way – Want to leave me something?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: This is all I seem to have.</p>
<p><strong>orville</strong>: Army button. Where’s the uniform that goes
with it?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What do you want for – Yeh? A very good
question.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I might even know. I think I’ll try to go and
find out.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: All right, you – march.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You loaded your gun for this?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: No – you did.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Come on, you! Keep moving!</p>
<p><strong>pete’s voice</strong>: Where you guys goin’?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You want them uniforms out, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>pete’s voice</strong>: I’ll tell you when.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What you think you’re doin’?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: That’s all right. Just barge right in! I’m
going to tell you something…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No, you’re not. You’re going to listen.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You lost some uniforms? You thought they were
burned?</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: They were.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No, they weren’t, but they are now because I
just set fire to them.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: They’re smouldering right now in the
warehouse at the sawmill, and there are about seventy men down there who
were ready to wear them.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Wear them? What for?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: What other reason? To get in the post and
take the gold from you.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You were taking a detachment up north on an
Indian scare?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Well, that scare is a fake. A ruse. So you
know where to send them now.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Look here, Lieutenant –</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Correction.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: Major?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You better get down to that sawmill, Captain.
They may try it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>iles</strong>: I guess I owe you an apology.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I guess I owe you something too.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Only fifty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I wish there was something I could say
or do.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: There is. You can give me back my gun.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: And you can give this one back to the
sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: I’ll always remember what a fool I made
of myself.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I always try to forget.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caslon</strong>: Are you going too?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Not with them…</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: There’s seventy men ready for any kind of
play. I say we can still swing it – and get out of town.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Can we?</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: You wanted to give Haven time. Well, he took
it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You better get out before he takes you.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: By that I presume you intend to remain.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ve been here as long as I remember.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: I asked you once if Haven moved me out. I
think he’s moved us both out – together.</p>
<p><strong>prince</strong>: This is the way I wanted it… and when I’ve
finished you will too… as though Haven had never been here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You cause me an awful lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Yeh… but I finally brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You didn’t really think Mark would use it,
did you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Maybe I just wanted to send you a gun.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Isn’t it a little late to make any
difference?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: It’s pretty late.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I have to arrest you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Murder.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I could have killed you from the window –
but I didn’t. And I didn’t kill the two men – or Goodard.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Maybe Mick – maybe Prince – who knows.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’d almost as soon be killed as arrest
me, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Which are you – Wells Fargo or Army?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Army.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I guess it’s my turn to wish you’d gone to
China.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I wish I had too.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: If you still have that gold, and I think
you do, we might make it yet. You see I believe that every man has his
price.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Some men don’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: But every woman knows it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Only there wouldn’t be any women on my jury.
And that’s why you’re not as bad off as you might think… I could find
twelve men who might think you capable of almost anything – but I
wouldn’t bet they’d vote that way after staring at you through a trial.
Mick is dead for the murders and Prince can be hung for the rest of
it…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s no good…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I’ll get someone –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tell me something…</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This gets us all. This doesn’t count.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tell me something – on the square.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did you ever – love me?</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: All the time.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Tell it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: From the first night and the first time of
the song. I tried to get away from it, but every time it came back.
Every time I tried to get it out of my brain I just pushed it deeper
into my heart. It had to be either you or me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s all right. I love you… Well – say
it.</p>
<p><strong>haven</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: See you… in China.</p>
