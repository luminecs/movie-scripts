<h1 id="capote">capote</h1>
<p><strong>title up</strong>: “Western Kansas, 1959”</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot of his
book, and he says to me: the writing’s going well, but I just want to
make sure it’s not one of those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, your
novel’s about a Negro homosexual who’s in love with a Jew – wouldn’t you
call that a problem?</p>
<p><strong>christopher</strong>: Susan’s father had a minor heart
attack, so she’s writing more erotic poems about death and sex.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s so tiresome.</p>
<p><strong>williams</strong>: Hmm. What rhymes with angina?</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: How’s your writing?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Oh, I’ve got a million ideas of what to
write next – I just have to choose one.</p>
<p><strong>grayson</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Who would I want to play me? Natalie
Wood.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Too fat.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Audrey Hepburn?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Not bad. Sort of middle-class.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: When a movie is made of my life I know
exactly who I want as me… Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>female voice over the phone</strong>: New Yorker
magazine.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: William Shawn, please. Adorable one? All of
a sudden I know what article I’m going to write for you next.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: …never had anything like this happen to them
before. They’re used to sleeping at night with the doors unlatched….
Yes, we should buy stock in Master Locks – all of Kansas will be in the
hardware store tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: They have no idea who the killer is. But it
doesn’t matter who the killer is – what matters is who the townspeople
imagine the killer is. That’s what I want to write about.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m gonna need some help… I’m thinking about
Nelle – she can protect me…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I want to leave tonight…</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: I figured you’d missed it.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: God I’m glad you agreed to come. You’re the
only one I know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant
and personal bodyguard. Oh, Nelle, you poor thing.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Off. Truman. Off. I’m happy to see you too,
but I can still whip your behind.</p>
<p><strong>porter #1</strong>: Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper Lee.
Where would you like these, sir?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: That one up there and that one on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: What all did you bring?</p>
<p><strong>porter #2</strong>: Thank you greatly, sir. It’s an honor to
have you with us. If you don’t mind my saying, your last book was even
better than the first –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You’re sweet.</p>
<p><strong>porter #2</strong>: Just when you think they’ve gotten as
good as they can get.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Thank you. You’re very kind.</p>
<p><strong>porter #1</strong>: Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: You’re pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: You’re pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: You paid them to say that.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: You paid them to say that!</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: How’d you know? How did you know?!</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: “Just when you think they’ve gotten as good
as they can get.”</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You think that was too much? I thought that
was a good line.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of Investigation.
KBI.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Mr. Alvin Dewey, please.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Third floor. In what used to be the Sheriff’s
Office.</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: The wife said no more smoking in the house.
I told her, “Fine. Walter’s got a couch upstairs in his apartment. I’ll
stay with him and Dorothy till we’re done here.” I’ve got my bag and a
carton of cigarettes in the car.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Roy.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the New
Yorker.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Bergdorf’s.</p>
<p><strong>nye</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: The scarf.</p>
<p><strong>nye</strong>: Oh. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Thank you. I wonder when we could arrange an
interview? Some time to talk.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: We’re not looking for any inside information
– I don’t care one way or another if you catch whoever did this – I’m
writing an article not about the Clutter killings, but how they’re
affecting the town, how you all are bearing up –</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I care.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I care. I care a great deal if we catch
whoever did this.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: As do a lot of folks around here.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>nye</strong>: New Yorker?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: You have press credentials?</p>
<p><strong>nye</strong>: What’s the New Yorker?</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Magazines don’t give out –</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: You can come to the news conference with the
rest of them. Sears and Roebuck.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I’ll talk facts but I won’t speculate. The
main fact here we need to be clear on is not one, but four people were
killed. A lot of folks say Herb Clutter had to be the main target
because he was dealt with the most brutally –</p>
<p><strong>journalist #1</strong>: Had his throat cut.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Yes. We’d all like to know why. But it
could’ve been any one of the family they were after. We just don’t know
–</p>
<p><strong>journalist #2</strong>: You’ve identified the murder
weapon?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Wounds indicate a shotgun, close- range, but
no casings were found.</p>
<p><strong>journalist #1</strong>: Twelve-gauge, hunting –</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>journalist #1</strong>: They were all shot in the face?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: No. Nancy in the back of the head.</p>
<p><strong>journalist #2</strong>: Is there any evidence of, I’m sorry,
sexual molestation of the women?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>journalist #2</strong>: Anything else stolen?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Kenyon’s radio seems to be the only…</p>
<p><strong>journalist #3</strong>: The boy was sixteen?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>journalist #2</strong>: It’s her friend that found them?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Laura Kinney.</p>
<p><strong>journalist #2</strong>: Spell that?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I assume you’re okay with the Laura part.
K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave her be.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: There’s talk of a bunch of Mexicans, a
whole bunch of Mexicans…</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: George, it’s good to see you again. I do have
an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you
said, but it doesn’t matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or
Methodists or Eskimos. We’re going to find whoever did this. Four good
people from our community are dead. Let’s remember that. Okay with you?
The West Kansas Farm Committee’s offering a thousand dollar reward for
information leading to an arrest. Please print that. Thank you all for
coming.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Mr. Dewey’s protective of the Clutters. I
wonder how well he knew them…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: He was foxy with that old man. Are you ever
gonna let me drive?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Truman, you’re a menace. You can barely see
over the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: This make you miss Alabama?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Not even a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Can any of you tell me where I’d find Laura
Kinney?</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Oh, um…</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Is that her? With the tall boy?</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Yeah. With Danny Burke.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Danny Burke? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Truman. Truman –</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: These folks live their lives in a particular
way. You need to consider adapting yourself to that fact.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What –</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: – I’m gonna find out where those two kids
live. Maybe you’ll let me do that alone?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think I scared a friend of yours this
morning. He came looking for you while I was writing.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You hate my friends.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I wouldn’t say hate. So long as they don’t
knock on my door.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I saw the bodies today.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Which?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: The Clutters. I looked inside the
coffins.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s horrifying.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It comforts me – something so horrifying
it’s freeing. It’s a relief. Normal life falls away. But, then, I was
never much for normal life –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, you weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: People here won’t talk to me. They want
someone like you, like Nelle. Me they hate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t think of a single quality I share with
Nelle.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe manliness.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: My point exactly.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s why I left the Midwest in the first
place. I knew I could only find someone like you in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Danny? Would you mind terribly if I walked
with you for a bit?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I thought you were from the FBI with your
long coat.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s why I ran off.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’ve been getting a lot of that lately.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It’s fine talking to you all. Practically
nobody around here wants to talk since what happened.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Folks have been through a rough patch.
Including you. Nancy was your best friend.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: She was my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: How has Danny been?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever
happened to him before. Nancy just started wearing his ring again after
this huge fight – Mr. Clutter was trying to get her to end it ’cause
Danny’s Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: What were the Clutters?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Methodist. Danny was the last person at the
house that night. That’s why Mr. Dewey’s keeps interviewing him – they
don’t think he had anything to do with it – just to see if he remembers
anything unusual and all.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: People in town seem to wonder if he was
involved.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: That’s been real hard for Danny.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Oh, it’s the hardest – when people have a
notion about you and it’s impossible to convince them otherwise. Since I
was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way I
look and the way I talk. They’re always wrong. Do you know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Not one person here understands her.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Maybe you’ll get a better picture of Nancy.
And the family.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: It’s her diary.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: “Danny here tonight and we watched TV. So
nice just having him sit with us. Left at eleven. P.S. – He’s the only
one I really love.”</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: And that was that.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: The end of a life.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: “Shattered.”</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: “Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever
happened to him before.”</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I have 94 percent recall of all
conversations.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: 94 percent.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’ve tested myself.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: I hate that you’re better than me at
this.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Don’t you dare close your eyes on my bed.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Stand up and walk out that door. Go to your
room if you’re gonna sleep. Truman. Truman.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Crap.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: What right do you have being tired? You were
snoring blissfully –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t snore –</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: – while I lay there, hating you –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You don’t hate me.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Not much. What? Marie Dewey?… We’ve got
somewhere to go for Thanksgiving supper.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Apparently Detective Foxy’s wife has a
better opinion of me than Detective Foxy.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: You came.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Thank you for having us.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Thank you. Get yourselves in here. Alvin! Get
your pants on. They’re here.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: More. More.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Alvin will hate this.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes, but we who know the truth will love
it.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I have to stop. I cannot believe you’re from
New Orleans. I miss it so much.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I only lived there for a short while but my
Mama was born and bred.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: You know something – Alvin pretends he
doesn’t know who you are, but the minute you came to town he read your
books. He had one of his men pick up “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” in Kansas
City ’cause it’s banned from the library here.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What did Mr. Dewey think?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: He liked it more than he’s willing to
admit.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: How very foxy.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Mama would’ve put in half the bottle by
now.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Alright, one more shake.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: How you doing, foxy?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I was writing the script as they were
filming, all that time in Italy. I’d work like mad all day long and then
dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day’s scenes.
Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Humphrey Bogart.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: – where he and John drank every night –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: John Huston.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: – and I mean drank, like famished water
buffaloes. Well – I’d only just handed them the final scene when the
bellhop told me I had a phone call. It was my stepfather, Joe Capote,
calling to say that my mother had died. I flew home to New York –
terribly distraught – but when I got to the apartment I could see that
Joe was in even worse shape than I was. He grabbed my hands and sat me
down at the kitchen table, and he said to me, “Talk. Talk about
anything, any subject in the world. Don’t worry whether it will interest
me or not. Just talk so I won’t break down.” And I did. He couldn’t bear
to be alone with his thoughts. It was too painful.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: It’s been a hard couple weeks for Alvin. He
and Herb Clutter were good friends. From church.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Marie –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Oh come on, Alvin. These are good people.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Who would put a pillow under the boy’s head
just to shoot him? Why would they tuck Nancy in?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I want to know the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Twisted notion of tenderness.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: So many of my friends would love to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: That’d be fine –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You don’t have to worry. I’m not going to
write about this until everything’s over.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I’m not worried. I know what room you’re in
at the hotel. And I know where you live in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: “Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas…”
Main Street, CHRISTMAS LIGHTS in the TREES.</p>
<p><strong>holt</strong>: I’d of picked them up but I haven’t been
myself. Mind you, I make the walk out here every day, check the house,
make sure the pipes don’t freeze – that sort of item. The least I can do
for Mr. Clutter.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: How long have you worked here?</p>
<p><strong>holt</strong>: 1940 – a lotta years. The wife too, cleaning
the house. Cooking.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Well, she’s marvelous. Lunch was
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>holt</strong>: She had a hard job after what all happened.
Cleaning. I burned most of the rest – mattresses – too far of a mess.
I’ve asked around some – if anyone’s looking for a strong hand.</p>
<p><strong>holt</strong>: I don’t think they’ll be able to sell the
place till they catch the ones that did it. That’s what I hear
anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Remember Nelle’s manuscript she sent me in
New York?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird. You said
it was good.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: And I was right. She just heard Lipincott
wants to publish it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well. Jesus. That’s terrific. Tell her
congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Congratulations. Jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just promise you’ll be home by Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I can’t leave now Jack – I mean it was hard
at first, but now I’m practically the mayor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I want to come home – I do. Though if they
catch whoever did this, who knows what – I’ll probably be here til next
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right. I’ll let you go.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Jack, we’ll go away this spring to write.
Maybe Spain…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Alright, Truman.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Bye. The poor boy misses me.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Truman.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Nelle.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: You remember when we were kids?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I was never a kid. I was born fully
formed.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: I had no idea what a homosexual was. But I
knew whatever they were, you were one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>man in hall</strong>: Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: – girdle up – no extra bulges – if you’re
dressed right for him when he gets home, the evening should be smooth
sailing. Bon voyage, gals.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I can’t believe you got this whole page – I
only read it to you once!</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’ve trained myself.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: …trained myself.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I have 94 percent recall.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: …94 percent recall.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You cut that out.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: You believe that Alvin?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Impressive.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I’m sorry. He’s upset. – smoking three packs
a day. Two men did it. They know who. One of them used to have a
cellmate who gave him up for the thousand dollar reward. They passed
through Kansas City last week writing bad checks – by the time Alvin’s
boys got up there they’d skipped out again.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: They have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Alvin. Paul. Now.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Damnit. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Alvin …</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Alvin Jr. Get over here.</p>
<p><strong>alvin jr.</strong>: Dad, the phone.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Paul. Back to the table.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>alvin jr.</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Tell them we’re at dinner, Alvin.</p>
<p><strong>alvin jr.</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Not now, Alvin.</p>
<p><strong>alvin jr.</strong>: You need to call the Chief of Police in
Las Vegas when you have a minute.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: …This is KERG radio, Garden City. A
friendly broadcast from a friendly place. Our lead story:</p>
<p><strong>fade up on</strong>: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and
front seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. Truman
watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the headline in the
Kansas City Star: “Police Fear Lynch Mob.” The CAR RADIO is on.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: …newsmen from six states have
joined scores of Kansans as they await the arrival of confessed killers
Perry Smith and Richard Hickock. KBI officers have been driving the
Clutter family’s brutal killers nonstop from…</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Motorcycle accident. He broke them and they
never healed right. Alvin told me.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a
BOOK, and a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says “SHERIFF’S
RESIDENCE - PRIVATE”. Dorothy Sanderson opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Truman Capote.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you’d be left
alone this morning by that hard-working husband of yours. So I have
breakfast. I have news. And I have literature. My friend Jack mailed me
the book you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: “For the maiden of the Midwest, the
priestess of the plains, the queen of the kitchen: my first novel.
Truman.”</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You’re too much. Go on into the living
room, lemme grab that – it’s been ringing all morning.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh. Truman. I meant in there. I… um…</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s the women’s cell. It’s hardly ever
used. But they wanted to, um, separate… Please. Let’s sit in the living
room. I’ll set up in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: They put you in the women’s cell.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Among other indignities.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Well… she’s a good cook.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: She’s scared of me.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I think so am I. A little bit.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Are you? You have any aspirin? My legs –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Um. Truman? All set.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: His feet don’t touch the floor.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: In the matter of the State of Kansas v.
Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this Court has been
informed by counsel – Mr. Weeks – that defendants wish to waive their
right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Yessir. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Why are they doing that?</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: Mr. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I ask that the waiver be effectuated.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: So noted. We’re adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Mr. Capote.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Madame Sanderson.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Is that for the two of us to share? Or for
me to eat alone while you talk to our guest?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Was it your choice to waive the hearing?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You still need some? Give me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I could kill you if you got too close.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Would you like some water?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: He said we’d curry favor with the Judge if we
waived our rights.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: The lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Your picture’s undignified. People recall
first impressions.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What’s been your first impression?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You want something.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: From you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Truman. Walter’s gonna be home soon.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I just want permission to talk. Has anyone
else visited?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Truman –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Will you tell me if you need anything? I can
have whatever you want sent from New York. Will you do that?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: William Shawn.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Truman.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m writing a book. It’s too much for a
single article – this town, the killers most of all – you will be
stunned by Perry Smith –</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Why? What has he –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Not much yet, but I know. I can sense him.
He’s desperately lonely, frightened… I have questions – are you
ready?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Would it matter –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: How much more money can you send me? How
quickly can you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures?</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Perry, honey. You look terrific…</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Calm yourself down, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Be patient, Capote. Maybe later they’ll
send you my skin.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I have the perfect place for it, over the
hearth.</p>
<p><strong>title up</strong>: “One month later”</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Where’d Perry get the art set?</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: Members of the jury. Have you reached a
verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: Defendants rise.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene
Hickock stand accused of four counts of the crime of murder in the first
degree. Have you reached a unanimous verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We have, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: What is your verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Guilty. On all counts.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: Have you unanimously reached a
sentence.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We have, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: What is the sentence?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Death.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene
Hickock. You’ve been found guilty of four counts of murder in the first
degree. You will be taken to the state penitentiary at Lansing. No later
than midnight, May 13 of this year, nineteen hundred and sixty, each of
you will be hanged by the neck until dead. So ordered.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Alright, partner. Least now we’re not the
only killers in Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You think he slept at all?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I need to see him before we go.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: They’re going to transfer you up to Lansing
today. You’ll have to make sure to put me on the visitor’s list.
Otherwise I can’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Will you do that? I’m going to help find you
a proper lawyer. You need a serious lawyer for an appeal. They took Dick
last night. I need you to get him to do the same thing – put me on the
visitor’s list. Will you do that, Perry?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry.</p>
<p><strong>ben baron</strong>: Nelle. Kudos on “Kill the Bird.” Is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Close enough. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: He hasn’t written a word yet, though he says
it’s the nonfiction book of the decade…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: He’s little, but terrifying –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: He’s as short as I am. And almost as pretty.
I’d be with him right now but he’s being given new accommodations –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Most people assume he’s a monster. I don’t
see him that way. The book I’m writing will return him to the realm of
humanity – it’s the book I was always meant to write…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Watch out. This is the start of a great love
affair.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: …I was in Marilyn’s apartment just last
week. I had to break it to her that, of the four Matisses hanging on her
wall, two were upside down.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Another. To answer your question, I’m
following “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” by blazing a different path – by
inventing an entirely new kind of writing: the non-fiction novel.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You have a subject?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: On the night of November 14, two men broke
into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did
they do that? It’s been suggested that this subject is tawdry – it’s not
worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country – the
quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men – the underbelly,
the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I
spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by
that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers – and I’ll spend
more. Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of
view about almost everything. I think those who read it will be
similarly affected. Such a book can only be written by a journalist who
has mastered the techniques of fiction –</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You’re speaking of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You’re really very clever.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry’s decided to appeal. He claims their
attorney was incompetent – that he never raised the issue of temporary
insanity.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So you find them a new lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: They’re facing execution in six weeks, Jack.
They need someone to argue whether or not that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’d also like to see them alive, yes, thank
you very much. I need to hear their story.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: If you met him you’d understand. It’s as if
no-one’s ever asked him a single question about himself. He’s so…
damaged – and strange – unexplored… I don’t trust this Hickock fellow.
Perry’s the only person who can describe to me what happened that night.
I need to hear him say it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just be careful what you do to get what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m finding them a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Truman. You’re finding yourself a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>young prison guard</strong>: Warden Krutch will see you
now.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: We do well by our boys. Showers once a week.
Feed em good. We’ll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he
don’t eat. Get the food in through his arm.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Hasn’t eaten in a month. But it’s not his
right to kill himself. It’s the People’s right. The People of this
State. And that’s who I work for, the People. You can write any of this
down.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: No one told me.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Yah. Won’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: When can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: How about you come back Thursday?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: No. That’s no good. I need to see them now,
then whenever I want for as long as I want.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Not how we do things here.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I understand what a burden unlimited
visitation might be – on this institution, and on the People who pay for
it. I want to be clear that I don’t expect the citizens of Leavenworth
County to have to shoulder that burden.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: To be dispensed as you see fit.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: I didn’t know where to count your boy –
being half-Indian. I did him a favor though. Counted him White.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You’re a kind and generous man.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: My hero.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Thanks for your help with the lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: You must be desperate for a story to come
all the way out here.</p>
<p><strong>young prison guard</strong>: Mr. Capote. You’re entitled to
go in. You may, um, go in. If you wish.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: You want to see Perry. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Ask me, he’s just trying to prove the
insanity defense.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t care what your plans are for
yourself…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: But you’re gonna wake up enough to tell me
what you did with my tie.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It’s okay. It’s Truman. It’s your
friend.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: How’d you learn to draw like that?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Before she had us. Before she started
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Who took care of you as a child?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Orphanage. Me and Linda.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: That’s your sister?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: We’re not so different as you might think. I
was abandoned repeatedly as a child. My mama’d drag me along to some new
town so she could take up with another man she’d met. Night after night
she’d lock me in the hotel room – Mama’d turn the latch and tell the
staff not to let me out no matter what. I was terrified – I’d scream my
head off – till finally I’d collapse on the carpet next to the door and
fall asleep. After years of this she just left me with relatives in
Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Who raised you up?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: My Aunts. That’s when I met Nelle – she
lived next door. Your mother was Indian?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Cherokee.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Drinking was not a good thing for her.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: No tolerance for it.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: And your father?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: No tolerance for him either.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What I can’t decide is if you understand how
fascinating you are.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m sorry about your tie. They took it away
from me because we’re all on suicide watch. It’s why the lights stay on
at night.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I hope we’re past that now. You had me
worried.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t care about the tie. It’s just a pity
because it looked so good on you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Be careful of Ricardo. I think he wants you
all to himself.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Alright –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: But he’s naturally mendacious – not to be
trusted – if he had a hundred dollars he’d steal a stick of chewing
gum.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I want to take your notebooks with me – I
want to read them.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: If I leave here without understanding you,
the world will always see you as a monster. I don’t want that – I don’t
see you that way.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I tracked my father down in Alaska. I was 14.
One day I said to him, “Mom’s dead.” I could see it. A week later we got
the news. She finally drunk herself to death.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: This is remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Sometimes you see a thing – how it really
is.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: He trusts me – that’s why he gave it to me.
He’s given me absolutely everything. You should see his drawings, Nelle,
how good he is. He wants so badly to be taken seriously, to be held in
some esteem.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Do I what?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Hold him in esteem?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Well… he’s a gold mine. I mean he’s told me
his entire life, and now it’s all here for me to write down – All of the
history I need. His entire life in this Diary. His dead mother. A
brother and sister killed themselves.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: You tell him your mama did the same
thing?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I tell him everything. We’ve been talking
our heads off the past month. Sometimes, when I think how good my book
can be, I can hardly breathe.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Here’s what I wanted to read to you: “If
Called Upon to Make a Speech:” – this is exactly what I was talking
about – a speech just in case he’s ever recognized for an achievement:
“If Called Upon to Make a Speech: I can’t remember what I was going to
say for the life of me. I don’t think ever before have so many people
been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad. It’s a
wonderful moment and a rare one. Thank you!” There’s an exclamation
point on the end of that thank you, in case you didn’t catch it… Where’d
you go?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Christ. I guess it stopped being funny.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I never said it was. Listen to this…</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: You’re nothing if not hard-working.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You look good, healthy again.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Not a chance.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’ve decided on a title for my book. I think
you’ll like it – very masculine. “In Cold Blood.”</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: That refers to the crime or the fact that
you’re still talking to the criminals?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: The former, among other things.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’ve been wanting to ask if you’ll let me
look at your investigation notes.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: That lawyer you helped find for your friends
got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I heard this morning.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: – on the issue of inadequate counsel.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Alvin. Do you not want me to look at your
notes? You are permitted to say no.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I’ll tell you what: if those boys get off,
I’m coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I have to be in court at nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Call Roy Church. He’ll show you what you want
to see.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Hey, hey…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It was as much for me as for anyone. I
couldn’t bear the thought of losing you so soon.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: We’re going to be able to use your book for
our case. You’ll write we never got to raise our insanity plea. You
wrote how terrible the lawyer was?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I haven’t written a word yet.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Research. Waiting to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I had hoped –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What are you calling it?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: The book? I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: If I’m going to write about you – if I’m
going to determine how to write about you – you need to tell me about
that night at the Clutter house.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Why? Do you worry what I’ll think?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I know a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What is that you keep drawing?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You must hate having to come to this place
–</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry, I have invitations to be in Morocco,
Greece… I choose to be here. Those people have everything, all their
prayers have been answered, yet they’re more desperate than ever. I
prefer to be here with you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns at the
orphanage hated the smell. First month one of them found me shivering –
just trying to get through the night. The Sister pulled back the covers
and shined her flashlight to see what I’d did. The sheets were wet. She
hit me so many times with that flashlight she broke it. That night I
dreamed about the yellow bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It picked me
up and it clawed the Nun’s eyes and it lifted me into the sky.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m just missing this one piece, Jack. Be
patient with me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How long is that gonna take? Why don’t you try
leaving him alone for a while? Come to Spain. You can always visit him
later.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I’m off. I’ve got my own writing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Too many people around. I’ll leave the address
on the kitchen table. Truman, what do you do there when you’re not with
him? – It must be awful.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Think about what I said. Join me when you
can.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I will. I will. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I didn’t see you. Jesus, you… Come in.
Where’s the guard?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I can’t. I brought you some things, but I
have to fly back East.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: An hour. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Who are you going there to see –</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Capote, get it straight in your book – we
never intended on killing that family –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I told him that.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: No premeditation –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I told him!</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Your writings are magnificent. I hope these
help you do more.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I have so much material – from the trial,
from our visits, your journals. I have to organize it all, and I have to
start the process of writing. I’ll visit soon. Perhaps this fall. I miss
you already. Write me every five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Be good now.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls.
Ocean, sand, cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Truman. I was supposed to be home for dinner
with my wife three hours ago – I have not been able to tear myself away
from your book. It’s that good. It’s not good, it’s astonishing. This
first half is astonishing. If the second half lives up to this it, – it
– how much is left to do?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m already well into the third part, but I
– I can’t finish that till I convince Perry to describe the night of the
killings to me. I was planning to visit this fall, see –</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: I think you need to talk to him now.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: And we all need to see how this ends for the
final part. I can’t finish the book till I know what happens. If Perry
and Dick are executed it’s one thing – and if not, well –</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Truman. You got your ending –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I really don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: The Kansas court denied their appeal. It came
over the wire on Friday. You need to talk to Perry now. He’ll be dead by
September. I’m sorry, I know how much you’ve come to care about him.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Truman?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Right. Yes. Right.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: I want to set up a reading for you in the
fall, in New York. We’ll build some interest, and we’ll publish in the
fall.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in the
house.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Why aren’t you working?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I knew you couldn’t be depended on to stock
the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What would we feed our famous guest?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Plus – I finished my novel yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: My man, my hero, my talented… My man…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You said that.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You are the hardest worker, the most unsung
talent I know. As Nelle passes by on her way to London to sell her book
which needs no selling, may a little of her success rub off on both of
us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here, here!</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: When was the last time you wrote back to
him?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: A letter for your boyfriend I was asked to
deliver.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: From Perry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Let’s have it.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: “Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? Read this
item in a medical dictionary:”Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, by
fracture of the cervical vertebrae, by laceration of the trachea.” Not
too comforting as we lost our appeal. Missing you – alone and desirous
of your presence. Your amigo, Perry.”</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was wondering why you were in such a good
mood. Surely, I thought, it’s not because I finished my little book.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: That’s a terrible thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I used to write him all the time. I’ve been
so focused lately on the book.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Jack says I’m using Perry, but he also
thinks I fell in love with him when I was in Kansas. How both of those
things can be true is beyond me.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Did you? Fall in love with him.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Truman? –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t know how to answer that… It’s as if
Perry and I started life in the same house. One day he stood up and
walked out the back door while I walked out the front. With some
different choices, he’s the man I might have become.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think he’s what
I like about you best.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’ll see you at the reading in New York.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: The sixteenth.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Truman. Honestly. Are you going back to
Kansas because you care about Perry or because you need information
before he’s killed?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Can’t it be both?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: No. I don’t think it can be.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Hey, buddy. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What was he in jail for?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: They said it was not paying his taxes. But
really for being an outsider – refusing to go along.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: You don’t have to read any of these if you
don’t want to. But I thought you’d like something decent. You’re much
too smart for adventure magazines.</p>
<p><strong>row guard</strong>: Lock-down while Lowell goes to solitary.
Nobody in or out. You want in or out?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: In.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Everyone says he’s a genius. I don’t think
he’s a genius. He’s rich and he went to college – like any of us
would’ve if we got the chance. He came home for Christmas and shot his
parents –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: – in front of the television.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You remember the story –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: They were watching Father Knows Best.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I won’t be sorry to see him go. Always
correcting my grammar.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Now – Dick and me – we’re next in line.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m so sorry I’ve been away.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: It was a long time.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I wish you could come next week, when they
take him out to the Corner, but the whole prison shuts down.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I have to be in New York anyway.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: How’s the book going?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Will you show it to me?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’ve hardly written anything.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: Keep your head high, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Alright now.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: …or they won’t be able to rope you under
your fat fucking chin.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>ben baron</strong>: Hello Hollywood. That’s quite a bundle
you sold your book for.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: What a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>most stylish literary outfit</strong>: a gorgeous dark green
Knize SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed
GLASSES .</p>
<p><strong>young assistant</strong>: Mr. Capote. Can I get you
anything?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: No. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Welcome New Yorkers…</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Thank you for coming to the first public
reading, the first offering of any kind, of Truman Capote’s new work “In
Cold Blood.” Our magazine –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello. My name is Truman Capote.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry Smith’s voice was both gentle and prim
– a voice that, though soft, manufactured each sound exactly – ejected
it like a smoke ring issuing from a parson’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: The village of Holcomb stands on the high
wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call
“out there.” Until one morning in mid-November 1959, few Americans – in
fact, few Kansans – had ever heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of the
river, like the motorists on the highway… exceptional happenings had
never stopped there.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: The four coffins, which quite filled the
small, flower-crowded parlor, were to be sealed at the funeral services
– very understandably, for the effect… was disquieting. Nancy wore her
dress of cherry-red velvet, her brother a bright plaid shirt; the
parents were more sedately attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-blue crepe; and – and it was this especially that lent
the scene an awful aura – the head of each was completely encased in
cotton, a swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary blown- up
balloon, and the cotton, because it had been sprayed with a glossy
substance, twinkled like Christmas- tree snow.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Imagination, of course, can open any door –
turn the key and let terror walk right in. Tuesday, at dawn, a carload
of… strangers, ignorant of the local disaster – were startled by what
they saw as they crossed the prairies and passed through Holcomb:
windows ablaze, almost every window in almost every house, and, in the
brightly lit rooms, fully clothed people, even entire families, who had
sat the whole night wide awake, watchful, listening. Of what were they
frightened? “It might happen again.”</p>
<p><strong>literary enthusiast</strong>: Your portrait of those men was
terrifying. Terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>isherwood</strong>: Your hairpiece is terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I was going to say the same thing!</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Everyone was there.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Tennessee loved it.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Of course he did.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Should we do more? I was terrified, but
–</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: No, Now we get to withhold while everyone
else talks. Let them do the work.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: This book is going to change everything.
It’ll change how people see you as a writer. It’ll change how people
write. You’ll finish by October?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I think so. You know they’re scheduled for
next month?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Hanging. Yes. I’ll commit as many issues as
it takes to publish. Three. As many as it takes.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m flying to Kansas tomorrow. I’ll get
Perry to talk –</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Honestly, what’s he got to lose?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It really is too awful. Institutionalized
sadism.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: You’ll be able to finish now.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: As strange as it may sound to you, I’m going
to miss him.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: When did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: It’s what we’ve been waiting for. A stay of
execution to make a federal appeal.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: All thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Kansas’s had it in for me for ten years – in
prison the first time, at that trial, here. They can’t corner me now.
Not till the U.S. Government says so –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry, sit down. For a minute. I need you to
talk to me…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: We’ve got all the time in the world to talk.
About everything. I’ve been thinking about Ricardo. You need to stop
sending him those trashy books. I won’t even mention the pornography. I
realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me, but
those books only exacerbate the problem – only ‘heighten’ or ‘intensify’
it. Maybe we should start him on a program…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Give him the simple novels first –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Perry.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I know what exacerbate means.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Okay. I thought in case…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: There is not a word, or a sentence, or a
concept, that you can illuminate for me. There is one singular reason
that I keep coming here –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Truman –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: …November 14th, 1959. Three years ago. Three
years. That’s all I want to hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’ve asked you not to –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: This is ridiculous. I’m ready. I have a
plane to catch. I found your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she’ll talk to me
about something useful.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Don’t go out there.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Please don’t go out there.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: This is my work, Perry. I’m working. When
you want to tell me what I need to hear, you let me know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: They’ll play outside a while
longer.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: I don’t want them to see that.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: They’ve never seen these pictures?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: Too many questions.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: June’s dead. Frank shot himself. Now
Perry’s did what he did. I suppose I’m next. Some ruination will visit
me.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t think life works that way.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: It does in this family.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: I used to love him. He was my little
doll.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: He scares me now.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: Ten years.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Do you think I could borrow one of those
pictures?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: Take the whole thing. I don’t want’em
anymore. Just… Perry doesn’t know where I live. He thinks we’re still in
Portland. Please don’t tell him we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. murchak</strong>: Don’t be taken in by my brother. He’s
got this sensitive side he’ll show. You believe he’s gentle, so easily
hurt. But he’d just as soon kill you as shake your hand. I believe
that.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello handsome.</p>
<p><strong>row guard</strong>: You want to go in?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What’s the name of your book?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What’s the name of your book?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What’s the name of your book?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: “Truman Capote read last night before a
packed audience from his non-fiction book IN COLD BLOOD.”</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: More? “The true-crime novel tells of killers
Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who brutally murdered a Kansas family
three years ago.”</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Who sent that to you?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Who sent that to you?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: That’s not your goddamn business.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It is my business, because it’s not true.
The organizers of the reading needed a title. They picked one – a
sensational one, I admit – to attract a crowd.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: They picked it.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: That’s not your title.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I haven’t chosen one yet.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: How could I choose –</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You pretend to be my friend…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: How could I choose a title when you still
haven’t told me what happened that night? How could I? I couldn’t
possibly.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I have something from your sister.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: She misses you.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It’s alright. I’ll go in.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m sorry. I should have told you what they
made me call the book. I couldn’t pretend to be your friend. The truth
is, I can’t help wanting to be. You don’t have to tell me anything if
you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Look at my belly.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: There must be something wrong with us. To do
what we did.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: We heard there was ten thousand dollars in
that house. Once we’d tied up everybody and searched all over, I knew
the guy who told us about it was wrong. There wasn’t any money. But Dick
wouldn’t believe it. He went tearing through the house again, banging on
the walls, looking for a safe. He said when he was done, he was going to
come up to Nancy’s room and have his way with her. I wouldn’t allow it.
I told him that. I sat with Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: It was nice in there.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Dick came to get me and we turned out the
lights and went down to the basement, where we had Mr. Clutter and the
boy. Dick kept saying “No witnesses.” I figured if I just waited him out
he’d give up and leave them tied up there. We’d drive all night, they’d
never find us. Mr. Clutter’s wrists were tied to a pipe over his head.
He looked like he was hurt, so I cut him down.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: We put a box there on the floor so he’d be
more comfortable. He asked if his wife and daughter were alright and I
said they were fine, they were ready to go to sleep. I told him it
wasn’t long till morning when somebody would find them. He was looking
at me. Just… looking at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he expects me to
kill him – expects me to be the kind of person who would kill him. I was
thinking – this nice man, he’s scared of me. I was ashamed. I mean, I
thought he was a kind man, a good… a gentleman. I thought so right up to
the moment I cut his throat. I didn’t realize what I’d did till I heard
the sound.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Like some one drowning under water.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I was staring at him, bleeding on the floor.
I told Dick to finish him off, but he wouldn’t do it. We couldn’t leave
Mr. Clutter like that, so I got the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: We went to Mrs. Clutter’s room.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Then we drove off.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What do you think of me now?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Added up, how much money did you get from
the Clutters?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Between forty and fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: Hands typing on a MANUAL TYPEWRITER.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>title up</strong>: “One Year Later”</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: …I want to give it to you. The truth is, I’m
desperate to be done with it…</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Mr. Shawn, I… I’ve spent four years of my
life on this book… They got a stay of execution yesterday… Another,
yes….</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Supreme Court….</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: …It’s harrowing – all I want is to write the
ending and there’s no fucking end in sight… No. No, I haven’t been
drinking again…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know how you can eat that. Perhaps if
you weren’t drinking so much you wouldn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Dear friend Truman. Haven’t heard from you in
such a long while. Please help find new lawyer. If not, Dick will have
to write Supreme Court brief himself. Our last appeal. What a pair of
wretched creatures. Please help. Your amigo? Perry.”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your amigo.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Put it with the others.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You tried?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You need to get ready.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: At least pretend for Nelle that you’re having
a good time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Nelle.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: I thought I’d find you here.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Please, another.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Terrible.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Well. It’s torture. Torture… …what they’re
doing to me.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe it?
If they win this appeal I will have a complete nervous breakdown. I may
never recover. Just pray things turn my way.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: It must be hard.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It’s torture. They’re torturing me.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: And how’d you like the movie, Truman.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I frankly don’t know what the fuss is
about.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Mr. Capote?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the
Kansas Correctional System. Will you accept charges?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Mr. Truman Capote?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Will you accept charges?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Oh. Uh… Yes.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: You’ll accept charges?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Mr. Smith, you’re on the line.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Hello? I can’t – This doesn’t seem –
Operator, I don’t think you put me –</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Truman.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Hello, Perry.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: They let me make a couple phone calls before
I go down to Holding… You heard the Supreme Court rejected the
appeal.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I didn’t… I hadn’t heard that.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Yeah. They let me make two phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: We’ve got a date set for the Warehouse, Dick
and me. Two weeks and… Finito. April 14.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Will you visit me? Truman. Will you come
visit?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t know if I can. I’ll try. I don’t
know if I can.</p>
<p><strong>guard in background</strong>: Time, Smith. Hang it up.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Please visit me, Truman. Just…</p>
<p><strong>guard in background</strong>: Time. Smith.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Perry.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: You’re allowed three names of people you’d
like to witness tomorrow. If there’s anybody you want, tell me now.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Truman Capote.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: You want anything?</p>
<p><strong>last meal</strong>: three hot dogs, french fries, an ice
cream sundae, a strawberry soda. The Guard sets it down on the
chair.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Thank you. You sent the telegram to his
hotel?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: May I make a phone call?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: That’s him again.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: We’ve never even met. It is utterly
inappropriate for me to be talking to him.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Yes… I’m sorry, he’s out, gone out… I’m not
sure when…</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: You got a telex.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: “Perry. Unable to visit today because not
permitted. Always your friend, Truman.” That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: It’s not true, is it?</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Mr. Shawn? It’s Nelle… I just got this
telegram, has he seen it?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: He won’t look at it.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Would you put him on please?</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: He won’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and
put the phone on his ear, I need to speak to him.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: It’s Nelle.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Truman.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: “Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote:
Sorry that Truman was unable to make it here at the prison for a brief
word prior to necktie party…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: …Whatever his reason for not showing up, I
want him to know that I cannot condemn him for it and understand…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: …Not much time left but want you both to know
that I’ve been sincerely grateful for your friendship through the years
and everything else…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: …I’m not very good at these things….</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I have become extremely affectionate toward
you both. But, harness time. Adios amigos. Your friend, Perry.”</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: I didn’t think I’d be seeing you again. You
can visit for a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: Truman. No.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: He returns. Long time.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t know what you must think of me.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: You haven’t been foremost on my mind
lately. As you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You got the letter?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: It’s true. I mean I understand why you didn’t
want to come. I wouldn’t be here either if I didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You know Ricardo donated his eyes to science?
Next week, some blind man will be seeing what Dick used to see.</p>
<p><strong>hickock</strong>: He’d be better off the way he was. What
I’ve seen hasn’t been so nice to look at – but I guess it’s better than
nothing. They came around with a form. Hey. You’ll be walking down the
street one day in Denver, wherever – and suddenly these eyes will be
staring at you. Wouldn’t that be something?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It would be.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You’ll be watching?</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I don’t know. Do you want me to?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’d like to have a friend there.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Okay. Then I will.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I did everything I could.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: I truly did.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Goodbye, Perry.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You’re not rid of me yet. I’ll see you in a
few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: Perry Edward Smith. “For the crime of murder
in the first degree, by order of the Court of Finney County and the
Supreme Court of the sovereign State of Kansas, you are sentenced to
hang until you die.” You can say something if you want.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Is there anybody from the family here?</p>
<p><strong>krutch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Well. Tell them… I can’t remember what I was
going to say for the life of me…</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort
me.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies. Thou annointest my head with oil.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: My cup runneth over.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: Someday I’ll tell you about it. For the
moment, I’m too shattered.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: They’re dead, Truman. You’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>truman</strong>: It was a terrible experience and I will
never get over it. There wasn’t anything I could have done to save
them.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>nelle</strong>: But the fact is, you didn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>shawn</strong>: It came to the hotel this morning. I told
them I’d give it to you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Did we not know we were to die, we would be
children. By knowing it, we are given the opportunity to mature in
spirit…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Some take that opportunity. I hope I
have…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Life is only the father of wisdom. Death is
the mother.</p>
