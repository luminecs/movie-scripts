<p><strong>masami</strong>: They say that some elementary school kid
spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in Izu. The kid
wanted to go out and play with everybody, right, but he didn�t want to
miss the program he always used to watch back in Tokyo, so he records it
on the VCR in their room. But of course the stations in Izu are
different from the ones in Tokyo. In Izu, it was just an empty channel,
so he should�ve recorded nothing but static. But when the kid gets back
to his house and watches the tape, all of a sudden this woman comes on
the screen and says–</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: What is it, Tomoko?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Who did you hear that story from?</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Who? It�s just a rumor. Everybody knows
it.</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Youko told you?</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: No, it wasn�t Youko…</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: What�s up with you?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: The other day, I… I watched this strange
video.</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: With Youko and them.</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: So that�s what I�ve been hearing about you
doing some double-date/ sleepover thing! So, you and that guy Iwata,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: No, it�s not like that. Nothing
happened!</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Iwata… he found this weird video. Everyone
was like, �What�s that?� so he put it on and we all watched it.</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: And? What kind of video was it?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Just… weird, I can�t really explain it.
Anyway, right after we finished watching it, the phone rang. Whoever it
was didn�t say anything, but still…</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: It’s cuz, you know, we’d all heard the</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Waaait a minute. Are you faking me out?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Busted, huh?</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Oh, my… I can�t believe you!</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: But hang on… you really stayed the night
with Youko and Iwata, right?</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: So, how far did you and he get?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Oh… I can�t remember.</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: You can�t remember, huh?</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Man, you had me freaked me out.</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Was it true?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Masami!</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Masami!</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: I�ll put her on.</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Oh, man!</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Yeah, I�ve got a friend over now. Yeah.
Yeah, OK. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: The game�s gone into overtime, so they�re
gonna be a little late.</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Jeeezus, my parents…</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: Oh man, I�m tellin� everybody about this
tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>masami</strong>: I�m gonna use your bathroom. Don�t go
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: There seems to be a popular rumor going
around about a �cursed� videotape.</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Have you heard what kind of video it might
be?</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: Uh, don�t look right at the camera,</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Let�s do it again.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Have you heard what kind of video it might
be?</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: What I heard was, all of a sudden this
scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, �In one week, you will
die.�</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: I heard that if you�re watching TV late at
night it�ll come on, and then your phone�ll ring.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Watching TV late at night… do you know what
station?</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Mmmm… I heard some local station, around
Izu.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Izu?</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: And, do you know if anyone�s really died
from watching it?</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: Well, no one that we know, right?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: I heard this from a friend of mine in high
school. She said that there was this one girl who watched the video, and
then died a week later. She was out on a drive with her boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: They were in a wreck?</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: No, their car was parked, but they were
both dead inside. Her boyfriend died because he�d watched the video,
too. That�s what my friend said.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Do you know the name of the high school
this girl went to?</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: No… I heard this from my friend, and it
didn�t happen at her school. She heard it from a friend at a different
school, she said.</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: Mrs. Asakawa?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: This same kind of thing happened about ten
years ago too, didn�t it? Some popular young singer committed suicide,
and then suddenly there was all this talk about her ghost showing up on
some music show.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: But I wonder what this rumor�s all about.
Everyone you ask always mentions �Izu.�</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: Maybe that�s where it all started. Hey,
where was that Kuchi-sake Onna story from again?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Gifu, but there was some big accident out
there, and that ended up being what started the rumor.</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: A big accident?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Something terrible like that is
going to stay in people�s minds. Sometimes the story of what happened
gets twisted around, and ends up coming back as a rumor like this one.
That�s what they say, at least.</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: D�you think something like that happened out
at Izu?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Maybe. Well, anyway, I�m off. See you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>komiya</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>guy in suit</strong>: OK, Okazaki, I�m counting on you.</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Miss Asakawa? I thought you were going home
early today.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Could you check out this article for me?
Get me some more info.?</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: I guess…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Good. Call me as soon as you know more,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Ma�am.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Sorry I�m late. Oh, you�ve already
changed.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Aargh, we�ve gotta hurry!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Did grandpa call?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Why did Tomo-chan die?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Well… it looks like she was really, really
sick.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Will you do me up?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: You can die even if you�re young?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: If it�s something serious… well, yes.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: As hard as it is for us, what your auntie
and uncle are going through right now is even harder, so let�s not talk
about this over there, OK?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: You and her used to play a lot together,
didn�t you?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: How is sis holding up?</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: She�s resting inside right now. She�s
shaken up pretty badly, you know. It�s best she just take things easy
for a while.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I�ll go check on auntie and them, then.</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: OK. Ah, Yoichi. Why don�t you sit here for
a little while?</p>
<p><strong>aunt</strong>: Have you heard anything more about Tomo-chan�s
death?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: No, I…</p>
<p><strong>aunt</strong>: But the police have already finished their
autopsy!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Well, they said there was no sign of foul
play.</p>
<p><strong>aunt</strong>: That was no normal death. They haven�t once
opened the casket to let us see the body. Don�t you think that�s
strange?</p>
<p><strong>asakwawa</strong>: Yoichi?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What are you doing up here? You shouldn�t
just walk into other people�s rooms.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: You go on downstairs, OK?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: You go on ahead.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Uh… this is Okazaki. I�ve got some more
info on that article for you. The girl was a student of the uh, Seikei
School for Women in Yokahama City.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Excuse me. This is, um, kind of a strange
question, but by any chance were you friends of that young girl that
died in the car as well?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Please. If you know anything…</p>
<p><strong>girl right</strong>: They all died the same day. Youko.
Tomoko. Even Iwata, he was in a motorcycle accident.</p>
<p><strong>girl left</strong>: Because they watched the video.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Video?</p>
<p><strong>girl left</strong>: That�s what Youko said. They all watched
some weird video, and after that their phone rang.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Tomoko-chan watched it, too? Where?</p>
<p><strong>girl left</strong>: She just said they all stayed
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>girl right</strong>: There was a girl with Tomoko when she
died. She�s had to be hospitalized for shock.</p>
<p><strong>girl middle</strong>: They say she won�t go anywhere near a
television.</p>
<p><strong>yoshino</strong>: The bodies of those found were Tsuji Youko,
age 17, a student of the Seikei School for Women, and Nomi Takehiko, age
19, preparatory school student. Both their doors were securely
locked.</p>
<p><strong>yoshino</strong>: This is the first time I�ve -ever- seen
something like this.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>yoshino</strong>: Couldn�t say, aside from sudden heart
failure.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Drugs?</p>
<p><strong>yoshino</strong>: The autopsy came up negative.</p>
<p><strong>yoshino</strong>: These two, about to go at it, suddenly up
and die for no apparent reason.</p>
<p><strong>ryomi</strong>: They tell me that Yoichi came to the funeral,
too.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>ryomi</strong>: They used to play a lot together, didn�t
they? Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ryomi</strong>: This… this is where Tomoko died.</p>
<p><strong>ryomi</strong>: Tomoko!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Izu…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Look, I�m probably going to be late coming
home tonight, so just stick your dinner in the microwave when you�re
ready to eat, OK?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: �K… Mom?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What did you say? You are not to speak of
this at school, do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: I won�t. I�m going to school now.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: There�s no way…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: “My dad is fat. My mom is fat. That�s why
I�m fat, too.”</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Room for one?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Um, actually I�m here on business.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: They would have stayed here on August 29th,
all four of them. If there�s any information you might have…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Uh, hang on just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: August 29th…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: That…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: That! What tape is that?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: This? Hmm…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Maybe one of the guests left it behind�</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: This next scene is entirely visual. If you are
reading this translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor;
STOP reading this now and watch the scene for itself. Afterwards, you
can come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters
displayed.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: One week�</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Yoichi�s in elementary school already, is
he?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: His first year. What about you, Ryuji? How
have you been recently?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Same as always.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: And money is…?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I�m teaching at university.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Anyway. You said that the phone rang?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: That�s right.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: So if I watch it too, that phone over
there–</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Ryuji, four people have already died. On
the same day!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Well, why don�t you try calling an
exorcist?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Take my picture.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Turn this way.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Hurry up and take it.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: It�s over.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Well, it looks like your phone�s not
ringing.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Make me a copy of this, will you? I�d like to
do a little research of my own. There�s no reason to write us off as
dead just yet.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: There�s the guest list from the cottage to
look into… and the possibility of someone hacking into the local
station�s broadcast signals.</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Here�s that guest list you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Oh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: What are you gonna do with this?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Uh… sorry, I�m working on something
personal.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: So, it was you. You did it.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: So, what�d you come up with?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I don�t think any of the guests on the list
brought the tape with them. I couldn�t confirm it face-to-face of
course, but even over the phone I got the feeling they were all being
upfront with me.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: How about the other angle? Pirate signals
or…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: There�re no traces of any illegal
television signals being broadcast around Izu.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Here�s that copy of the videotape you
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Asakawa.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Have you ever seen this woman?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: There�s something strange about this
shot.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: From this angle, the mirror should be
reflecting whoever�s filming.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: So, what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Well, if the person who made this is a pro,
there�d be a way around that, I guess, but still…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Volcanic eruption… Eruption where?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: This is gonna be impossible to figure out
on just a regular TV screen, don�t you think?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.</p>
<p><strong>mai</strong>: Nice to meet you. I�m Takano.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Asakawa.</p>
<p><strong>mai</strong>: Sensei, the people from the publishing company
called about the deadline on your thesis again.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: What�re they talkin� to you about it for?</p>
<p><strong>mai</strong>: Because they can never get a hold of you.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Ask them to wait another week.</p>
<p><strong>mai</strong>: Sensei, ask them yourself, please.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: This is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Sada…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Is Yoichi gonna be all right?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: He�s used to it…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Whoever made this had to have left some kind
of clue behind. They�re probably waiting for us to find it.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>tape</strong>: Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou… boooouuuukonn
ga kuuru zouuu…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru zo. Did you
hear that, too?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I�m gonna check it out.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I�ve got it. It�s a dialect, just like I
thought. SHOUMON means �playing in the water� and BOUKON means
�monster.�</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: But, dialect from where?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Oshima. And the site of our �eruption� is Mt.
Mihara.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi? I�m gonna be a little late tonight,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: You can do it yourself, right? OK. Sorry.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I�ve got it! This old article…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Has your newspaper got someone out there at
Oshima?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I think so. There should be a correspondent
out there.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I need you to find out, and let me know how
to get hold of him. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What do you think you�re–?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: You�ve only got four days left, Asakawa! Your
newspaper contact and I can handle this from here on out. You just stay
with Yoichi.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Grandpa!</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: Whoa, there! So, you made it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi says he�s looking forward to doing
some fishing with you.</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: C�mon grandpa, let�s go!</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: OK, OK. We�ll get our things together and
then we can go.</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: There he is! C�mon, there he is, don�t let
him go!</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: Oh, oh! Ah… guess he got away, huh?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: That was your fault, grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: Well, whaddya say we try again?</p>
<p><strong>kouichi</strong>: We�ll get �im this time.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: How was work, mommy?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Yeah. Your Oshima contact came through. It
looks like the woman who predicted the Mihara eruption is the same woman
from the video.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Her name is Yamamura Shizuko. She committed
suicide forty years ago by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Have you got anything else?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I�m gonna have to check it for myself. I�ll
be leaving for Oshima tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Oshima? I�ve only got three days left!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I know. And I�ve got four.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I�ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>kouji</strong>: What�s happened?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Nothing. I just had some things left over
from work.</p>
<p><strong>tomoko</strong>: Auntie?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi! You brought this with you, didn�t
you? Why?!?</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Tomo-chan…</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Tomo-chan told me to watch it.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I should�ve been more careful. When I was at
your place that day, I could feel something there. I thought it was just
because of the video…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: You mean that Tomoko�</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: That�s not Tomoko. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi… he can see them too, can�t he?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: It�s all my fault. First Tomoko died, then
those three others. It should have stopped there, but it didn�t. Because
of me.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I wonder…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: How did the rumors about the video even
start in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: This kind of thing… it doesn�t start by one
person telling a story. It�s more like everyone�s fear just takes on a
life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Fear…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Or maybe it�s not fear at all. Maybe it�s
what we were secretly hoping for all along.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Mr. Hayatsu?</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: Aah, welcome! You must be tired after your
long trip. Please, this way.</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: Back in the old days, the Yamamuras used to
head fishing boats out in Sashikiji, though they don�t much anymore. You
know, one of Shizuko�s cousins is still alive. He�s just an old man now.
His son and his daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned inn. I went ahead
and booked reservations for y�all, hope that�s alright…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit
suicide?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: She was taking a real beating in the press,
being called a fraud and all sorts of names. After a while she just lost
it.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Shizuko was getting a lot of attention around
the island after predicting the eruption of Mt. Mihara. Seems that for
some time she�d had a rather unique ability: precognition. It was around
then that she attracted the attention of a certain scholar whom you may
have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: He was driven out of the university, wasn�t
he?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: This Professor Ikuma convinces Shizuko to go
to Tokyo with him, where he uses her in a series of demonstrations meant
to prove the existence of ESP. At first she�s the darling of the press,
but the next thing you know they�re knocking her down, calling her a
fraud. Hmph. Forty years later, the media still hasn�t changed that
much.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I�ve heard this story. But… I�m sure I
remember hearing that somebody died at one of those demonstrations.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: After getting kicked out of university, Ikuma
just vanished, and no one�s been able to get hold of him since. He�s
probably not even alive anymore.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: But, why even try looking for him?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Because he�s supposed to have had a child
with Shizuko. A daughter.</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: Well, I�ll be off then.</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: And for your rooms, how shall we…?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Separate, please.</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: �Sir.</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: Please, this way.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Please! If you could just answer a few
questions, about Shizuko…</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: I got nuthin� to say.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: It�s about Shizuko�s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: She did have a daughter, didn�t she?</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: You�re wasting your time.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Aren�t you gonna eat?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Umm…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: You�ll stay with me won�t you? When it�s
time for me to die.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Oh, stop it.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: You�ll stay, won�t you? If you stayed,
maybe you�d learn something that could help Yoichi–</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I said stop it! Have you forgotten There was
a girl with Tomoko when she died? That girl�s now in a mental
institution. Who knows what could happen.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: But you could stay with me, Ryuji. You�d be
OK.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Why, because I�m already not right in the
head?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: If that�s the case, why not just let things
run its course, get rid of father -and- son? Yoichi was a mistake,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: We still have two days left…</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: It�s about Miss Shizuko.</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: This is all that there is…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Is this Professor Ikuma?</p>
<p><strong>kazue</strong>: …yes. This picture is from before I�d entered
the household.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Shoumon bakkari… boukon ga kuru zo…</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: Y�all�d do best to be off soon. Sea�s
probably gonna be rough tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: What kind of a child was Shizuko?</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: Shizuko was… different. She�d come out
here by herself ever�day an� just stare out at the ocean. The fishermen
all took a dislikin� to her. Ocean�s an unlucky place for us, y�see:
every year it swallows up more of our own. You keep starin� out at
somethin� ike that…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Shoumon bakkari shite�ru to, boukon ga</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Shizuko could see �inside� people, couldn�t
she? Down to the places they�d most like to keep hidden. It must have
been difficult for her…</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: Please leave! Now!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I�ve got a little of that ability myself. It
was you who spread the word about Shizuko, wasn�t it? And you who first
contacted Professor Ikuma?</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: What�re you–?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: You thought you�d be able to make some money
off her. You even got some, from one of the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: Leave me the hell alone!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Tell us about Shizuko�s daughter. Who was
she?</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: I don�t know!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: She was there, with Shizuko. She had to
be.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: You were there!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: You stood there and watched the
demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Match.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Match.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Faker! This is nothing but trickery, and
the lowest form of trickery at that.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What are you trying to pull, woman?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: That�s right! Professor Ikuma, you�re
being fooled!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: What�s happened?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #4</strong>: He�s dead!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #5</strong>: Witch!</p>
<p><strong>shizuko</strong>: Sadako? Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Sadako?!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Sadako killed him? She can kill just with a
thought?</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: She�s… a devil spawn.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: That�s right. After Yamamura Shizuko
committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran. No, no one
knows where they went. That�s why I need -you- to find out where they
are. Even if the professor�s dead, Sadako should still be in her
forties. I�ll explain it all later, but right now just hurry!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Sadako�s probably already dead. She could
kill people with just a thought, remember? Her mother wasn�t even close
to that.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Well, what about that video? If Sadako�s
dead then who made it?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Nobody made it. It wasn�t made at all. That
video… is the pure, physical manifestation of Sadako�s hatred.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: We�ve been cursed.</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: It�s no good. With the typhoon coming in,
all ships are temporarily staying docked.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: What about the fishing boats? Tell their
captains I�ll pay.</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: Fishing boats? Sir, without knowing whether
this typhoon is going to hit us or not, I think it�d be better to wait
and see how things turn–</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Fine! I�ll try searching myself!</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: Mr. Takayama!? Mr. Takayama…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Mrs. Asakawa? I�m sorry. I tried, but I
couldn�t come up with any leads at all.</p>
<p><strong>okazaki</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Izu…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Ryuji!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Ryuji! The phone in my apartment never
rang! It only ever rang at the rental cottage! Professor Ikuma
must�ve…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: And we�ve got no way of going back.</p>
<p><strong>hayatsu</strong>: It�s too dangerous! The thought of anybody
going out in this weather…</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: I�ll take you out.</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: Sadako is callin� y�all, reckon. Mayhap to
drag you down under the water.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Please. Take us out.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: It�s funny. I�m not afraid at all.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Sadako probably died back out there at Izu,
before the rental cottages were ever built.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: So, Sadako was Professor Ikuma�s
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Ikuma smuggled her out in secret. His
relationship with Shizuko was already a scandal, and one of the reasons
he got drummed out of the university… We�ve gotta find Sadako�s
body.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Is that going to break the curse? Will
Yoichi be all right?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: It�s all we�ve got left to try.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Just one more day…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: We made it. Maybe Sadako doesn�t have it out
for us after all.</p>
<p><strong>yamamura</strong>: Shizuko… she used to -speak- to the ocean,
just ramble away. One time I hid, listenin� to one of her
conversations.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi? It�s mommy. I just called to say
I�ll be coming home tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: I�m tired of it here, mom! I wanna go back
to school.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Yoichi, it�s rude to your grandpa to talk
like that.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: He�s laughing. You wanna talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: No, that�s…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I�m sorry, Yoichi. I�ll… I�ll see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>yoichi</strong>: What�s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Mommy�s got something she has to do. Say
hello to grandpa for me, OK?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: What time was it when you first watched the
video?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Seven or eight minutes past seven. PM. No
more than ten minutes past.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: If the rumors are true, that time is gonna be
our deadline.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: -Here-.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I knew it! The well.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: The well…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Her own father!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: It was Ikuma who put this lid on. And
Sadako�s still inside.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I�ll go.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Sadako was alive! She�d tried to climb her
way out.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Lower the buckets!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Take it up!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Take it up!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: It�s already six!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: I know! Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Take it up!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Asakawa!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: What the hell are you doing? Trying to get me
killed?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Asakawa!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: We�ll change. You�re in no condition to keep
this up.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa:</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Who do you expect to pull up these buckets,
then?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: But, we don�t even know if it�s doing any
good…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: And what about Yoichi, huh? Is his mother not
coming to pick him up after all?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Don�t look down!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Where are you? Please, come out.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Please. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: It�s you…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Hey! Asakawa! It�s already 10 minutes past
seven! We did it!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Why would Ikuma have killed her? His own
daughter…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Maybe she wasn�t his daughter at all.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Maybe her father… wasn�t even human.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: It�s gone…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Enough, already. It�s over. C�mon. I�ll take
you home.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: …thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: That girl…</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: This next scene is entirely visual. If you are
reading this translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor;
STOP reading this now and watch the scene for itself.</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: That�s it! Asakawa…</p>
<p><strong>ryuji</strong>: Aaargh!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Are you a resident here, ma�am?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I�m Takayama Ryuji�s wife!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I�m sorry ma�am, but they�ve already taken
the body away.</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mai</strong>: When I got here he was just lying there…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Did he say anything to you? About a
videotape?</p>
<p><strong>mai</strong>: His face…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Ryuji… why? Does this mean that Yoichi will
die, too? Is the curse not broken yet?</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: I was the only one to break Sadako�s curse.
Ryuji… why…? Something I did that you didn�t… Something I did that you
didn�t…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Ryuji?!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Something I did that you didn�t…</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: What broke the curse was that I copied the
tape and showed it to someone else!</p>
<p><strong>asakawa</strong>: Dad? It�s me. I�m on my way over. Look,
dad, I�ve got something to ask.</p>
<p><strong>girl a</strong>: They say there�s a way you can stay alive
after you watch the video. You�ve gotta make a copy of it, and show it
to somebody else inside a week.</p>
<p><strong>girl b</strong>: But what about the person you show it
to?</p>
<p><strong>girl a</strong>: Well, then they make a copy and show it to
somebody else. Again, inside a week.</p>
<p><strong>girl c</strong>: Then there�s no end to it.</p>
<p><strong>girl a</strong>: That�s just it. There -is- no end. But if it
meant not dying… you�d do it, wouldn�t you?</p>
