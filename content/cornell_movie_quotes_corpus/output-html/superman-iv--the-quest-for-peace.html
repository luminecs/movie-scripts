<p><strong>captain</strong>: Spare us the serenade, Comrade Sinatra.
You’re not at home.</p>
<p><strong>cosmonaught</strong>: At home my kids tell me to save my
singing for outer space…</p>
<p><strong>cosmonaught</strong>: I’m lost! Goodbye! 9 THE CAPSULE</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I think you’ll be safer in here, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: by now Kal-El you are entering the
atmosphere of the planet known as earth …</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 31 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Clark! You in there?</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 36 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hello, Mr. Hornsby. It’s been a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Didn’t I mention that there was an offer to
buy … sight unseen?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m sorry, but I don’t want to sell the farm
to a big developer. Whoever buys it has to want to keep a working farm.
I don’t think we need another shopping center.</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Darn it, Clark Kent, why are you so
stubborn? Today nobody wants a farm. Blink your eye and they’ll all be
gone. That’s progress!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mr. Hornsby!</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: My, oh my! Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 37 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Dad liked a good joke.</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Hey, thanks, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Hey! Batter up!</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Oh, yeah, you never could hit a curve
ball.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I think I’ll hold out for a real farmer,
Mr. Hornsby.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 38 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: . . . and you were just as obstinate as
your father.</p>
<p><strong>hornsby</strong>: Be careful in that big City, Clark. You’re
a long, long way from where you were born.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I never forget that, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Uh, Hi, this is Clark … Kent. Please leave a
message at the beep.</p>
<p><strong>beep</strong>: 43 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark … it’s Lois. I hope you’re up. Perry
wants us in the office on time. Something big is going on. . . Au
Revoir.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hi, Lois. I’m up. Gee, I wonder what Perry’s
got in mind …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh well, bye Lois.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: And … in the news, we have word that the
East-West arms control talks have broken down. The President is
scheduled to address the nation later … and that is the good news - just
kidding …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Oh, please. . .no. . .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’ll take this man to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman . . . thank you.</p>
<p><strong>con</strong>: What is that god-awful noise you’re makin’?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Mozart, my low-forehead friend. Even this
wretched pit can’t diminish the spirit of true genius …I while you’ve
been bending your back in this foul slime, I’ve been inspired! Life
itself began in a murky pool much like this. And a genius such as myself
learns to seize the moment. You are the first to know that I now have a
plan to recreate life itself!</p>
<p><strong>one deputy</strong>: You better be breakin’ a sweat, Luthor,
or we’ll feed you to the wolves!</p>
<p><strong>tall guard</strong>: Hey Luthor, let’s get those duds
dirty.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Surrounded by Neanderthals!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yo pops, where the hell is this and how do I
get to Ft. Lauderdale?</p>
<p><strong>fat marshal</strong>: Son, you’re on the wrong side of the
State. You got yourself one heck of a sound there, son.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I guess you yo-yo’s have never seen one of
theses Sensearound 100’s.</p>
<p><strong>tall marshall</strong>: Oh, yeah, I seen one in a magazine
Once.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Go on, get in. Only way to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>fat marshal</strong>: Hot dog!</p>
<p><strong>tall marshal</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>fat marshal</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Did I do okay, Uncle Lex?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Lenny, I’ve always thought of you as the Dutch
elm disease of my family tree. But this time, nephew, you did fine.</p>
<p><strong>con</strong>: How ‘bout givin’ us a break too,
Mr. Mozart?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Just because I use my genius in criminal ways.
. . doesn’t mean I’m not a firm believer in law and order. You men
belong in prison!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Are we going to skip the country, Uncle
Lex?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public
school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind
during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You’re late, Kent!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Right, sir. I promise it won’t happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Ha!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: But where is . . .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: . . . everybody?</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Boring … tedious … abominable …
enough!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What’s everybody doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Regardez. Voila Monsieur David Warfield.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: That tycoon who owns all those sleazy
tabloids?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those
sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Don’t tell me. You only read the
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: In fact, Mr. White, I only read the
ledger. A ledger which the previous owners paid so little attention to
that I was able to buy the paper out from under them. The Daily Planet
hasn’t made money in three years.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: And the name of the game is making money.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Ladies and gentleman, my daughter – Lacy
Warfield!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Nice to make your acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: She made her money the old fashioned-way. She
inherited it.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Lacy will be helping you, Mr. White.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Helping me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Here it comes. Get ready to tie down the
chief.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Once upon a time The Daily Planet was a nice
paper. Now it’s … fatigued. I’ve brought with me mock copies of our new
layout.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Sir, the world isn’t really at the brink.
Isn’t that headline, a bit irresponsible?</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Maybe. But it’s a hell of a circulation
booster.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mr. White, don’t do anything rash.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Rash? There’s the rash that infects world
journalism. If you think I’m going to let you turn this grand old lady
into one of your bimbos . . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Before your dramatic stage exit, Mr. White,
may I point out that daddy holds your contracts. Which you will have to
honor.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Excusez Moi, Your Spoiledness . . .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Why is Lois speaking French?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She’s getting to that part.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: . . . I’ve got a plane to catch. I’m covering
the emergency European ministers’ conference in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Not so fast! All trips are canceled. We pay
for wire services. And what we don’t get from them, we’ll invent.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Mr. White, come with me I want to see</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: No Paris?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I don’t think we’re being treated fairly,
Lois. And I’m going to tell Miss Warfield.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark . . . wait!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Miss Warfield, I think I speak for all of us
when I say we’ll do our best to co-operate. But a reporter’s first
allegiance is to the truth. The people in this city depend on us. And we
can’t let them down! . . . Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Is he for real?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: One hundred percent. And I like him that
way.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I think he’s kind of cute.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world’s
oldest boy scout Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful… and I don’t
remember the rest, but he’s them too. And I promise, he’s not interested
in anyone like you.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: But all men like me, Lois. I’m very rich.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: . . . And very na�ve!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Lois! Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: The President is about to speak. I don’t
think it’s going to be good news.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can
it be?</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Hopefully very terrible, Miss Lane! We can
double our circulation with a good international crisis.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Isn’t that wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: . . . and because the Summit has failed,
we have no choice but to strive to be second to none in the nuclear arms
race . . .</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I know you’re all upset by the crisis. The
best thing we can do is try to think positively. Is there anything we
can do?</p>
<p><strong>one boy</strong>: Yeah, let’s hold class in a bomb shelter.
Maybe some of us would make it to our senior prom.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Come on, doesn’t anyone have a
suggestion?</p>
<p><strong>another boy</strong>: A lotta good that would do.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Somebody has to be an optimist.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 85 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>one girl</strong>: He’s so spaced out he wouldn’t even
notice.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Anyone else …</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I’ll tell you who’d I’d write a letter to
that would do some good.</p>
<p><strong>a girl</strong>: Who- Santa Claus?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: No, Superman.</p>
<p><strong>another girl</strong>: You’re probably best friends.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You all think you’re so cool, right? You’ll
be cool even when the whole place gets vaporized … Well, I’m going to
write Superman a letter and send it to the Daily Planet.</p>
<p><strong>another boy</strong>: And seal it with a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: ‘Dear Superman . . .’</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Okay, let’s move on to our newest and most
popular exhibit.</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Superman has graciously donated a strand of
His hair to the museum. So we all could have the fun of seeing how
strong he really is. Here you can see a 1000-pound globe easily
suspended by his single hair.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Guess who! . . . Of course it’s me! Your old
buddy! Lex Luthor . . . Hey, you don’t look too bad yourself. ‘Course
I’ve put on a few pounds, but what the hey! They feed you a lot of
starch when you’ve in prison. That was ’prison’ . . . as in where you
put me, Mr. Clean. Say, we should get together soon. Over lunch, over
dinner, or … over your dead body.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Do you realize what I can create with a single
strand of Superman’s hair!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: A toupee that flies?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: . . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the
Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: But why the hair?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: That hair contains a sample of Superman’s
genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and
enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with
all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: It’s brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You’ll
write a new series – ‘Metropolis After Hours.’</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I really don’t think . . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: But you’re perfect for it. You’re young,
you’re single, you’re successful…</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: And I’m usually in bed by ten-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: That’s just it! You don’t have to flaunt it.
You’re no slave to fashion … although …</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: They make my eyes itch.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Don’t worry. I won’t make you do it alone. I
know all the right places. I’m a member at all the right clubs . . .
We’ll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It’s a
date!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: A date?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It’s just . . . research, actually.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: This letter was addressed to Superman care of
me.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Superman gets mail here?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh, probably just a picture request. I’ll
take care of it if you want, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I don’t think ‘fan mail’ fits this letter.
Read it, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: ’. . . I don’t care if everybody thinks I’m a
space cadet. Once you’ve destroyed all the nuclear missiles in the
world, they’ll see I was right. Superman can make sure we don’t blow
ourselves up. Quick and easy. Thanks a lot. I know you’ll come through.
Your friend, Jeremy.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Poor kid. Oh well, back to work.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I think there’s an angle.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: An angle?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat
it up. We’ll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting
for Superman’s answer.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Jeremy! Do you have a question?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I thought … I …I was just daydreaming.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m sorry to interrupt your lesson, but I
wanted to answer Jeremy in person.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Class … we have a guest speaker. A friend
of . . . Jeremy’s.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: This is the most important letter I’ve
ever received, Jeremy. But I’m afraid what you’re asking is . . .
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Impossible? Why?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Because I made a vow. Never to interfere
in the destiny of your planet.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: But what good is a vow if everything gets
blown away? What good was my letter?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m going to pass this letter on to all
the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I,
that represent the people of Earth.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’m sure we all want to thank Superman for
taking the time to visit us. Thank you. We understand.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Well, I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>classmate</strong>: Told you so!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I am … smarter than I thought. It’s working!
Quick, Lenny. Prepare the Nuclear Chamber . . . Lenny? Lenny! . . .
LEONARD!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Get the radiation suits!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Every day the earth is bombarded by radioactive
cosmic rays. Over millions of years, the radiation made single cells
evolve into . . . us. Now, Leonard, your Uncle Lex, using this
protoplasm I’ve grown from Superman’s cells, will duplicate Creation
itself in a matter of seconds!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: It’s . . . alive!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He missed the door, Uncle Lex.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Quiet! You’ll make him self-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: F-f-f-f-faaather. . . !</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He called you father. What a . . . moron! He
needs something to wear too, Uncle Lex. Unless you want to let him out
looking like this!</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: What I need this for?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just
put it on.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Now break it!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Whoa. . .</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: He has all of Superman’s powers. If I’ve
planned it right. . .</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Very good. Now. . . the final test . . . let’s
see if he can fly. . . I command you to rise.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Okay, okay, he needs a little coaching.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I don’t ’know what this country’s coming to.
This used to be a fine paper – Aha, here.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Gee, Uncle Lex, I don’t think this guy’s much
of a dancer.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Let’s try to keep your I.Q. a family secret,
Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him …
see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out
party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he
proves himself, then . . .</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Yes . . . f-f-faaather. . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: You’re late. Very late.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gosh, I’m sorry, we better get in line.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Oh, Clark, you’re so delightfully
primitive.</p>
<p><strong>young guy</strong>: See, it’s our honeymoon and we just
wanted to have one dance here.</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: So I can tell everyone back home.
Please? One dance?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Good evening, Miss Warfield.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m with . . . her.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’ve never been in a place like this
before.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: This is Metropolis after hours! This is what
you’ll be writing about. C’mon, let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Clark! They get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Be right back. Need some fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I believe you’re supposed to dance.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Don’t tell me. You learned to dance at church
socials.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Actually, I had a crash course from my mother
the night before my prom.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris
the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I
thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the
poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it’s
all so confusing. You think I’m silly, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No … Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in
Smallville – my hometown – everything was more simple. People would
sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: That’s not what we were taught. ‘Look out for
number one’ – that’s daddy’s golden rule … he always ends up with the
gold.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh . . . no, there’s no one back home.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: What about here?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, my career takes up a lot of my
time.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re waiting for lightning to
strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: That sounds kind of pessimistic.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: No, realistic. There’s no magic in the world.
Girls just don’t get swept off their feet anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I feel kind of light-headed . . .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>one bouncer</strong>: You got a pass, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: N-n-n-no . . .</p>
<p><strong>second bouncer</strong>: Then scram, before you scare away
the customers.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hey, cutie, let’s boogie.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I like the rugged type.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I know a romantic spot we can go for a
nightcap. I’II go get my purse. Don’t disappear!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I must have miscalculated. How. . .</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Poor Uncle Lex.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Bringing the kid who wrote the letter to
Metropolis will be our greatest publicity gimmick. And it was your idea!
Perhaps it’s time to discuss giving you free reign at one of my papers .
. . Miss Publisher!</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He
never even said good night!</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . .
a . . . reporter!</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went dancing
. . . for a story . . .</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Your grandfather had one iron rule that’s
stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own
station. Am I clear?</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Go ahead son. Tell the American public
what you told me.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I just said . . .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: This time he’s gone too far.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m through taking it lying down.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 163 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Did the Chief look different to you?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: He looked like my Dad did every time he went
to the bank to try and borrow money.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m Clark Kent, one of the staff
reporters.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Do you know Superman ?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Yes, I’m acquainted with him.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Just tell him I didn’t mean to cause him
trouble. Tell him not to listen to what all these papers are saying. I
just want him to do what he thinks is right.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m sure Superman cares a lot
more about what’s in one boy’s heart than all the editorials. Amendment.
No: 6 REVISED 24-Sep-86</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I know I have been forbidden to act, but
now the Earth awaits a fate as terrible as Krypton’s.</p>
<p><strong>one voice</strong>: The earth is too primitive. You can flee
to new worlds where war is long forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>second voice</strong>: If you teach the world to put its fate
in any one man – even yourself – you are teaching them to be betrayed .
. .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You have taught me well . . . but
sometimes there is more to learn from children than the wisest of
men.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: The notion that your father would stoop low
enough to attack Superman just to sell more papers . . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I know I’m not exactly a Girl Scout but . . .
maybe if I show him I’m trying . . . he’ll like me.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Clark. He’s late again. I can’t figure him
out.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: That’s because there’s nothing to figure out.
Now will you please pay attention. I’m not through insulting your
father.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he’s
not like other guys . . . he’s different. It’s like you come from two
different worlds.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: And your heart beats faster just thinking
about him.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel
. . .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: But he’s never there.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Why, Lois, I didn’t know . . . Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Look, up in the sky . . . It’s . . .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman. . .</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Got it! Mr. Warfield said he wanted pictures
of you with lots of local color, but I can’t think of anything else
really special.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What a scoop!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Would you mind taking a walk with me?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Absolutely!</p>
<p><strong>chinese patrolman</strong>: I don’t think he has a pass.</p>
<p><strong>swedish patrolman</strong>: I don’t think he needs one.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Would you mind waiting for me in the
visitor’s gallery?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: N-no…I mean…you bet.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Madame Secretary, I represent no country.
May I address the delegates?</p>
<p><strong>secretary general</strong>: Yes, well… you need a
sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>secretary general</strong>: I believe that will do.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: This is intense!</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: What’s he going to say?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Something . . . wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: For many years I’ve lived among you as a
visitor. I’ve seen beauty in your many cultures and I’ve felt joy in
your many accomplishments. . . I’ve also seen the folly of your wars . .
.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: . . . As of today, I am no longer a
visitor. The Earth is my home too. We cannot live in fear. I cannot
watch you stumble into the madness of nuclear destruction. So I have
come to a decision . . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I am going to do what your governments
have been unable to do. . . I will rid our planet of all nuclear
weapons.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: All-right !</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: He’s got it, sir. Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: So far, so good. It will take even Superman
a long time to dispose of these arsenals.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Let’s just make sure he doesn’t
leave one side with few souvenirs.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I trust Superman.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: So do I. But . . . he’s the only
person I do trust.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Nice to see you too, gentleman. If we can just
relax, I’ll get started with the introductions.</p>
<p><strong>romoff</strong>: If this is a CIA trap, you’ll never take me
alive!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: My nephew LENNY is learning the drums. Guns
don’t kill people – people kill people. Look, I know you’re all a little
choked up right now . . . overcome by the joy of knowing that Superman
is ending the arms race . . . Think of it, Dubois, you can finally
retire. You can go into something nice like home appliances. There’s a
real mark-up in dishwashers . . .</p>
<p><strong>howler</strong>: Get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: The points is that I, Lex Luthor, the greatest
criminal mind of the modern era, have discovered a way to destroy
Superman!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the
good part.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Get the box, nephew.</p>
<p><strong>dubois</strong>: I warn you, Luthor, if you’ve dragged us
here just to tell us you possess a piece of kryptonite . . .</p>
<p><strong>romoff</strong>: We’ve all tried to use kryptonite
before.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Doesn’t the word ‘genius’ mean anything these
days? Behold, my unscrupulous friends . . .</p>
<p><strong>howler</strong>: Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is?
Why it’s just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to
incinerate an average man like . . . that.</p>
<p><strong>howler</strong>: But Superman isn’t an average man.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you’ll join
forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits
again.</p>
<p><strong>romoff</strong>: What is your plan?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish
. . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your
missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun,
he’ll get the biggest surprise of his life. I’ll be able to introduce
Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!</p>
<p><strong>howler</strong>: And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of
yours can defeat Superman?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if
all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome
enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce
Superman’s skin. He’ll be mortal, he’ll get sick . . . and we’ll dance
on his grave.</p>
<p><strong>dubois</strong>: Why should we make a deal with a notorious
scoundrel like you?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Don’t!…Then the world will have eternal peace
and you boys will have to find day jobs. Just remember, the more fear we
make, the more loot you take. As long as the world hangs on the brink of
war, the good life is available to every criminal . . . regardless of
race, religion or natural origin!</p>
<p><strong>howler</strong>: And what do we get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: If my plan works, gentlemen, I’ll just take a
tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a
lot of zeros after it.</p>
<p><strong>howler</strong>: I got your payload on this missile. This is
the only chance we’ll have for Superman to throw it into the sun.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Stop shivering. Everything’s working
perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Maybe I should sit this one out.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Don’t give up. This is a perfect subject for
your series on young Metropolis. Now let’s get those knees up!</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Now you try, Clark. We’ll start you off with
60 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: If you say so. Here goes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess your friend doesn’t know his own
strength.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Clark, this is Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Want to try this one, Clark?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No pain, no gain.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: He’s a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems
like a lot of people I know are jerks . . . . . . Maybe you think the
same thing about me. That’s why you keep avoiding me.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m not avoiding you. I’ve been very busy and
. . . I like you . . . I really do.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with
Superman about his peace mission . . .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Yes, I know. I’m sure it will be a great
story.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I’ll just invite them both to my hotel suite
and we’ll have high tea. It’s very chic.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gee, I don’t think . . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Come early. The view is so romantic from my
balcony.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Could you hand me those weights, Clark?
They’re very light.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I mean, Lacy . . .</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well . . .!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No pain, no gain.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, Uncle Lex, how’s the Nuclear Guy goin’
to find his way here?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my
last experiment . . .</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: The one Superman wrecked up?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The
remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He’ll
remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He’ll find his
way back to me. Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You’re spookin’ me out, Uncle Lex.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey! He looks . . . normal.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: He’s . . . beautiful. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: First things first. I want to give you a few
tests. Check your reflexes.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I hadn’t counted on this but . . . . . . of
course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I
am a …</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: You are . . .</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: You are . . . nothing. I am father
now.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Hey! Just remember I made you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You’re just an experiment, freako!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, no . . .</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: I am an experiment? I am freako?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I made you, and I can destroy you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: . . . I was just goofing around really . . .
. . . if anybody’s a freako around here . . . . . . it’s me!</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Destroy . . ? Destroy Superman now!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: You remembered. You sweet thing, but not quite
yet. Come on inside, we’ll discuss the perfect way to do it.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Didn’t you see it? He lifted me up and
crashed me down.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that’s a
trick that could come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: He’s . . . cold. . .</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Good. Let’s hope he stays that way.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Of course! That’s his one vulnerability. The
one way he can be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 249 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Lenny, my loud-mouthed nephew, he gets his
power from sunlight! In darkness . . . he’s like you . . . useless.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: This is just like a double date! . . . How do
I look?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Illegal . . . just like you looked in the six
other dresses you tried on. Believe me, no matter what you wear, Clark
will not notice.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Clark! . . . but maybe it’s Superman.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman likes to make a different kind of
entrance.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 252 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Hi, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The
cabbie didn’t have any change.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: . . . Let me get my purse.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, hi, Clark. Can you believe it! Warfield
gave me a list of questions to ask Superman.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: ‘Are you or are you not part of a plot to
weaken our national defense?’</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It’s her father’s grey matter that’s weakened
if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Politely?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I’ve got eighteen dollars . . . and a gold
card.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: She’s nuts about you. Notice her dress.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: AMENDMENT NO.9 Revised: 20-Oct-86</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: . . . Um, hey! Neat dress.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Shouldn’t you pay the cabbie?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh . . . Right. . . I’ll be back in a
flash.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Clark! CLARK returns into her view. LACY holds
out the forgotten taxi change which he takes and exits. LACY exits
closing the door behind her.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Our other dinner guest.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Hi, Lois. It’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Too long. Superman, I’d like you to meet Lacy
Warfield. The boss’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Very nice to meet you. That’s a lovely
dress you’re wearing.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Well . . . I think I can start the interview
without Clark . . . Two is company.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I better fetch Clark. He’s probably helping
the cabbie change a flat tire or some other good deed!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: We’ll be more comfortable in here.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Something smells wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Just a little duck and scallops in champagne
sauce . . . in case we got hungry . . . later.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I hope it wasn’t too much trouble.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Of course not. Right, the interview . . . Have
you had any trouble confiscating the missiles?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Well, Lois, there is always the chance
that a few warped individuals who would take advantage of the world’s
good will</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Oh, my God! Dinner ! Don’t budge , I’ll be
right back.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I missed you. It wasn’t any fun up there with
just Lois and Superman. They’re so boring. Let’s go do something
wild!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: But they’re expecting us. It wouldn’t be
polite.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: How can one man be so square and so delicious.
Very well. We’ll go back up and make chit-chat. But if I have to face
Superman, so do you.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh . . . my . . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Clark. . . !</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It’s funny. I’ve never had duck turn out so
perfect, Superman . . . Superman? . . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: On the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: The city looks beautiful doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Yes it does. Very beautiful. Our whole
world is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I think beauty is meant to be shared . . .
with someone you . . . love.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: They’re back.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Where’s Clark?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: He was getting on . . . and then this man with
luggage and . . . oh, it’s a long story.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It always is with Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Hi. Is dinner ready? I’m famished.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Let’s sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS
calls out to the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Superman! I’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gee, I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: No mind, it’s only antique Irish linen.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Careful. Don’t cut yourself.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I better go wash this off before the stain
sets.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Now we can eat.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Now they’re both gone. This getting
ridiculous. 264 ON THE BALCONY - SUPERMAN</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: ‘Some enchanted evening You may see a
stranger.’ Look at me. I’ve finally made it to Broadway. Don’t worry,
Blue Boy, you’re the only one who can hear me. It’s my own frequency.
Think of it as Lex T.V.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Look to your right - tall, dark and
handsome.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I’m about to blow twenty stories off – give or
take a floor or two. Peace.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m terribly sorry, Lois. But an emergency
has arisen. Please apologize to your guests. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Wait! . . . Tell me . . . I’ll cover it!</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Lois, have you seen Clark?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Guess who? It’s your old friend, Lex.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Luthor, I suspect if you had actually
planted a bomb you’d be far away from here by now.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the
super guy. You’re right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the
world peace bit to make a social call. I confess . . . I tricked you.
Hey, you look great!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: If you have any social skills, you’ve
learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Know something? You’re a workaholic. A good guy
24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get
a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: It’s common knowledge you hate children
and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Why? Because I want to be the first one to
introduce you to a new kid on the block.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Look closely at his cell structure. See
anything familiar?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You’ve broken all the laws of man, Luthor.
And now you’ve broken the laws of nature! . . . I assume you must have
hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: You know, Mr. Muscle, I’ll really miss these
chats we’ve had together. Now that Einstein is dead, you’re the only one
who could keep up with me. Lenny!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Boy, are you gonna get it.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: My nephew, Leonard. He worships me. Let’s share
a toast to you . . . a nice guy who’s about to finish last.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I forgot, you don’t drink on duty.</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Destroy Superman!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Wait! Not yet! Back!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Your time in prison has twisted you into a
delusionary state, Luthor.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing
on my mind . . . the end of Superman.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I’ll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster
who didn’t work nearly as well as I might have liked – you were clearly
his better – he needed more energy, more power.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Which explains why you sent his organic
matter to the sun.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest
ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers,
Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we’ll make a
fortune rearming the world.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: You’d risk worldwide nuclear war for your
own personal financial gains.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Nobody wants war. I’d just like to keep the
threat alive.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex
Luthor. And you’ve wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I’m taking you
in.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Nifty, huh? Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is
. . . inevitable Now, destroy Superman.</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: First, I have fun.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Where’s Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: She must still be in the house!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Jenny’s inside!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: . . . Please leave your message at the
beep.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark, it’s Lois. This is the fourth message.
I’ve left. . . Where are you ?</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: I said you’d get to run one of our papers
yourself. And I meant it. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: That’s very . . . thoughtful Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: This time you’ve both gone too far. From now
on you can print your rag without Lois Lane.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Darling, it’s good riddance. Let her go.
And while you’re at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn’t been here in
days. He hasn’t even called.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I know Daddy. I’m worried about him.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Didn’t we have our little talk about
personal involvement with the help? Now that you’re the publisher . .
.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Daddy . . . ?</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Yes, darling?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Stuff it.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Excuse me, can you tell me where we can
find Perry White?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Who wants to know?</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: I’m Bill Compton from First Metropolis
Bank and this is George Hendrick from Metropolis Trust . . .</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Gentlemen, gentlemen, I’ve been expecting
you. Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mr. White . . .</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Not now, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Mr. Howler, I will give your associate Lex
Luthor one chance to explain why we should listen to him - a known
international outlaw – instead of throwing him in jail forever. And
investigating you.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: A reason ‘Why’? . . . Superman tricked you!</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Senator, if what he says is true, I
must recommend we immediately go on full military alert. We have to
watch the skies for any sign of a sneak attack. We can’t afford not to
heed Mr. Luthor’s warning.</p>
<p><strong>romoff</strong>: I am proud to call him comrade.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Comrades, we all know ‘world peace’ is a
capitalist plot . . .</p>
<p><strong>dubois</strong>: Vive Lex Luthor !</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Clark, it’s Lois. I’m getting a little ticked
off. This is positively my last call. Where the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>howler</strong>: Lex, we all appreciate how you’ve supported
us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we’ve
decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Gee guys, that’s swell of you. But . . . I’ve
got another idea.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Gentlemen, I’ve decided to assume full control
of all your operations. As my first official act . . . you’re fired. And
. . . according to my calculations, your share of the profits come to .
. .</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: . . . In round numbers. . . Nada, Zero,
Zip!</p>
<p><strong>romoff</strong>: You’re mad!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: If you need a reference while you’re looking
for work . . . forget it.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Nice bit. You’re good. With my brain and your,
well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities are staggering. I could be . . .
Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: What do you fear?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team?
It’s like I’m the coach and you’re the best power forward ever. What
could I have to fear?</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Destiny.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lois? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You’re ill. I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It’s just a bad flu, really. How did you know
. . .</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: You haven’t been at work . . . you didn’t call
the office . . . you didn’t even call me. How could you not call
back?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: All right, whatever it is I’m sure you’ve got
your reasons. But I knew you were here. Somehow, something pulled me
here. I’ve always known when . . . Superman is in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Superman? Has something happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Everyone’s saying he’s . . . dead. But I know
that isn’t true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You know him so well. But I’m sure he’ll
manage . . . wherever he is.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: But if he wasn’t able to manage . . . if he
really was in trouble, then I’d want to tell him some things . . . . . .
I’d want to tell him that I cherished the time we spent together. And I
never expected anything from him. Even if I only saw him for a few
moments, it made me happy. And I’d want to tell him that I love him and
that I’II always love him. And . . . no matter what happens on this
world, I know he tried his best to help us . . .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I know he’d thank you, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Feel better soon, Clark. And if you should see
him or hear from him . . .</p>
<p><strong>jor-el</strong>: . . . All that remains of Krypton’s energy .
. . is yours. . . after it is gone, you will belong solely to your new
home . . .</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Morning, morning. We’ve got a heavy schedule. I
want to show you off to a few world leaders. We’re expanding into the
insurance market. I’ll insure them against you!</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: 372 CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: I love the smell of money in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: I am master now.</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Wait for my return. I will bring back
the girl.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Gee Uncle Lex, I thought you could control
that Nuclear guy! You made a significant screw-up, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Shut up, Leonard.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that’s all
the common man reads!</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: I’d just like to have a little less
sensationalism.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Less sensational papers go broke. I
thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is
business.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We
can’t continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we’ll just lead
everyone into a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Don’t be over-dramatic, young lady. What
kind of disaster could we help bring about?</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: Oh my god … what is it?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Daddy . . . !</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: You know I am about out of patience. Just say
you’re sorry , about the cash and . . .</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: I will return for you.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: But first, I have fun.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Are you crazy? You’ll start a war. . They’ll be
nobody left except you . . . a beast.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: We’ll all fry.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: This wasn’t in the plan.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I’ve got something.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Do we have identification?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s not ours. They say it’s not theirs
either.</p>
<p><strong>navy</strong>: Can we risk launching?</p>
<p><strong>army</strong>: Can we risk not launching?</p>
<p><strong>first general</strong>: What if it’s not theirs?</p>
<p><strong>second general</strong>: What if it is!</p>
<p><strong>third general</strong>: We haven’t given ourselves any other
choice. Prepare to counter-attack.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Don’t worry honey, I’m sure he’ll make a swell
husband.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Ready, Uncle Lex?</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: If you need us we’ll, be five hundred feet
underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear
spring.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Uncle Lex . . .</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Superman. . . But you’re… dead!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Superman! The monster is going to start a
war!</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Uh… right! You’ve got to stop him. He’s mad! I
did what I could but he’s kind of lovesick for the girl. Boy am I glad
to see you. I’ve learned my lesson too, I’m siding with the good guys
from now on.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I’ll deal with you later.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Right, good. Tell you what, we’ll wait right
here. Till you get back.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I have no right to ask you this. It could
be dangerous . . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Ask me. It’s about time I did something for
someone else.</p>
<p><strong>cheif of staff</strong>: Ready to launch. . . 9, 8, 7. .
.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: . . . 6, 5, 4 . . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Ready. Let’s see what I’m made of.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Stop the countdown! It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: All systems cease action!</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Where is the woman?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Give it up. You’ll never find her.</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: If you will not tell me… I HURT
PEOPLE!</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: How much do I owe you, young man?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Okay, Buster. Hold it right there.</p>
<p><strong>swat commander</strong>: Let him have it!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Stop! Stop! You win! I’ll take you to
her.</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Far away from here, and safe.</p>
<p><strong>continued</strong>: AMENDMENT No: 4 REVISED 11-Sept-86</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: No! Don’t go in there! She’s not in
there!</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: Lacy? Lacy!!</p>
<p><strong>nuclear man</strong>: You shall be my Queen! Come!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You think he’ll find us.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay
low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I’ll have a new plan.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Lucky I brought my drums.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: But . . . how could you beat him?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: High School Physics, Luthor. While I was
recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was
born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.</p>
<p><strong>lex</strong>: But . . . but isn’t the world about to be
osterized?</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: No . . . it’s the way it always is . . .
on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.</p>
<p><strong>con</strong>: Hey, Mozart’s back!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: This boy has been under a bad influence.
Can you help him?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Every boy can be helped, Superman.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: That’s what I think too.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mr. White, are you sure you know what you are
doing? Here comes Warfield.</p>
<p><strong>warfield</strong>: You’d better have a good explanation,
White, or you’ll be talking to your lawyers from jail.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You know, I’m not a tycoon. I’m just an old
reporter. But I’ve read enough in my own paper the last few years about
hostile takeover of companies. You must have been asleep at the wheel
Warfield, because I managed to convince the Bankers of this city that
the Daily Planet should be treated like a natural resource . .
.Protected from predators. They lent me the money, I bought all the
outstanding shares, and you, my friend are now the minority
shareholder.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t see him anywhere Miss Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Well, well . . . I finally beat Clark Kent to
a press conference.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Daddy’s offered me jobs at some of his other
companies. But, I’ve been thinking maybe I’ll take some time off. I’m
going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a farm . .
. see what the slow lane is like.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m sorry to see you go.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: You don’t have to be polite, Clark. I’ve got a
pretty good idea of how you feel about me.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’m not so sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Any more like you back home, Clark?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Like me?</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright
blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way,
the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: You’ll find a good man Lacy. You deserve
one.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Maybe if you’d have met who I am now, instead
of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been
different between us.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Lacy. . . I . . .</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: No. Don’t answer. I want to consider the
possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: If you get to Smallville, I know a real
estate agent . . . . . . Levon Hornsby. He may have the perfect place
available. Tell him you know me.</p>
<p><strong>lacy</strong>: Say goodbye to Superman for me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi Mr. Kent. How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: It’s a beautiful day, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: It must have been a super effort to get out of
bed, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well, I’m feeling a lot better . . . almost
chipper . . . . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good
nurse.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She must have had some strong medicine. Lois
said you were really ill.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Well Jimmy, sometimes a little loving care is
the best medicine.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I’m glad you’re here. And don’t forget I’m
covering Superman’s press conference. You just tape reactions from
people in the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh no, I left my new tape recorder in the
taxi! Somebody save my place.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Same old Mr. Kent . . . he’ll never
change.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Nice to see you again, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Once more we have survived the threat of
war. And once more we’ve found a fragile peace. I thought I could give
you all the gift of freedom from war. But I was wrong. It is not mine to
give.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: . . . Our Planet is still young. There are
galaxies around us with other civilizations to meet and learn from. A
community of planets for us to join. What a brilliant future we can
have. But there will only be peace when the people want it so badly,
their governments will have no choice but to give it to them. I wish you
could all see the earth as I see it.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: . . . Maybe you can! If you’ll all excuse
me for one minute. One step and he bounds into the air!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: I need your help, Jeremy.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of
the world what you see.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: I’ll try. . .</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and
the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Go on . . .</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: But you can’t tell where one country begins
and another ends. You can’t see any borders. It’s just . . . one
world.</p>
<p><strong>superman</strong>: Good. If you can see it, and I can see it,
maybe some day everyone will see it.</p>
