<p><strong>julie</strong>: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It’s
been a year since my last confession…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I killed a man. Well, I thought I
had…then…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Go on…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I have these dreams…horrible dreams. And this
man is always there with me.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen
and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn’t…gotten away with
it. I don’t know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the
guilt…to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You know? But how could you…</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Nice to see you find Political Science so
stimulating –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Julie! Wait! You okay?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You don’t seem fine.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I had another dream, Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The shower again?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It was in a church…it was so real. I mean, I
could feel his breath on me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I thought I was over the dreams for good. I
really did. I hadn’t had one for months.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It just takes time, Julie. It’s gonna get
better.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It can’t get worse. I mean, it’s not like
this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full
night’s sleep, my grades suck, I’m this close from being thrown out of
school.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It was one year ago…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s…the anniversary. That’s what’s going
on…Take it easy on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m trying. I really am…Sometimes I don’t
even know why I came up here in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: To get out of Southport?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Right. Now I remember.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Nah. I’ll probably just be here studying for
finals. The joys of summer school… Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Thanks for the talk, Will. You’re good to
me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Um…Okay. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I got in early. I was excited… Who was that
guy?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, that’s Will. He’s a friend. You’d like
him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray, we’re just friend.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Every guy in history who tried to pick up a
girl did the good-friend thing first.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Why are you being like this?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, I’m sorry. You’re right. Are you ready to
go? I’ve got the old truck. You know the drill…Crab boil at Ollie’s.
Croaker Queen Pageant…It’s only small-town fun, but it’s still nice.
People really miss you. I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray, I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Can’t what?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I just feel like some part of me hasn’t
healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please
understand…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I understand something.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s not like that. It’s not you. It’s me. My
head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I
want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I have to work, Julie. My boat’s in Southport,
remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe
from me, too.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s okay. I’m just gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean… I’m just
scared…that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay. Okay. Face your fears…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I thought you were out of town!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What are you doing in my closet?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I thought you were out of town!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What are you doing in my closet?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: i just wanted your black pants, but I’m not
ready to die for them!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That was heart attack time, Karla.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: No. When I put these skinny pants on my
body…Now, that’s heart attack time.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m not going anywhere. I’m fat, ugly, and
depressed.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Yeah, right – whatever.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I think I just really hurt Ray’s
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Listen to me, Julie. Ray’s a great guy,
nothing against old Ray, but he’s so…Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport.
Will’s a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There’s nothing between Will and me.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Yet. Nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: You know what I want to do to you …right
now, don’t you? There’s gotta be somewhere we can be alone.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I don’t think so. It’s pretty crowded.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Just for a minute, baby. I got something I
wanna tell you.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: If you can say all you gotta say in a minute
then I don’t wanna hear it.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I’ll talk real slow.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Ask her to dance.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: You’re the most beautiful woman in the bar
tonight, Jules.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of
nature.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: That’s right. It’s how the species survives.
You’ll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Say yes.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: No means yes.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my
people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Worse comes to worse, you can stand there
and watch me.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Come on, I’ll take a break and we’ll all
dance.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Karla! Did you tell him I’d be here?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Nope. I told him that you absolutely,
positively would not be here at this bar between ten o’clock and eleven
o’clock tonight. And then he came anyway.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This was not my idea.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I said, this…Do you want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Where I come from, you want to snatch the
goodies, you got to at least talk to them first.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How about a drink?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ben…</p>
<p><strong>slicker guy</strong>: Hye, baby. You following me up here?
Well, all right.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That could break the machine.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie, people who end up making rules like
that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The number’s unlisted…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Would you relax? We’ve been dating three
months. He ain’t stalking your butt.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay, okay. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: This is Mark in the Morning for Magic 96.7
Radio Station! Who am I speaking with?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God!
I’m Karla. Karla Wilson. Jules, it’s Mark in the Morning.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Well, Karla, what’re you doin’ at home over
the long fourth weekend?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Well, I’m in school and –</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: How’d you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky
Getaway?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Good, then I hope you remember your geography,
Karla, because all you have to do to win is tell me the capital of
Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Brazil? Um…</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: C’mon, Karla, one easy question, one great
getaway!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: …South America…Carnival…</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Karla, we need an answer. No looking it
up.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Still here…thinking… You mean Brazil, the
country?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Okay, Karla, five seconds. Five…Four…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Rio de Janeiro!</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Oh, no…Did you say Rio?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: No. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You just won Magic 96.7’s Quickie Getaway…a
trip for four to Tower Bay Island in the fabulous Bahamas.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: We’ll call you back with all the details…So
what’s your favorite radio station?</p>
<p><strong>karla and julie</strong>: Magic 96.7!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I won. I won…I won, I won, I won. Now, let’s
see…There’s Tyrell, that’s one. And, there’s my parents …And I got some
cousins. Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That
means you gotta get yourself a date.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey, Ray…phone!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey. I’m really glad you called… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, you don’t have to be sorry. I’m the one
–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, I shouldn’t have left so fast… I was
just…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Julie, I love you. I know I’m only a humble
fish, but if you really look at it, you’re a fish, too. Oh, Ray, you’re
right…Do me like a snapper. Hey, something smells like fish…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An
island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What? The Bahamas? You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We’d have a long weekend just to sit in the
sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and… You know…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This weekend?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’ll go away with you’re college friends, but
you won’t go away with me?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s not you, it’s Southport. And it’s the
Bahamas! And it’s free!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray, come on. I want us to be together.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Julie, we’re working a big run up here. It’s
been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don’t think I
can do it.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Will you try…for me, please?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay, I’ll try. But, listen… If I don’t make it
up, then you go ahead and have a great time.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray…please try. I really miss you. Okay.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: That boy has got fish on the brain. Hey,
cheer up, Charlie. We’re going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Man, what is your problem? We haven’t caught
anything for days. Pull the big ugly stick out of your butt. She asked
you to go to the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go. We’ll both drive up. I got
friends I can see up there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stupid. Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Stupid. What were you thinkng?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You wanna see what I’ve been thinking?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the
bomb.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I should go up there. I should call her back,
tell her I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: No way, man. Surprise her. She’ll be
psyched.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Man, I love AM radio. You got right-wing
conspiracy, tips for pregnant womem, Single-A baseball games, and real
country music… None of that new crap…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I don’t know, man. Maybe we should keep going,
find a phone –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: The guy looks dead.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey! Buddy, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Dave?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Girl, it’s gettin’ down to the wire.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s not coming. I thought he was just…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie, you left four messages… Four.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But, he said he’d try.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: He said he’d try. Try is like maybe. Try is
nothing!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He does work hard.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Work hard, huh? He’s breaking your heart just
because he can. And I don’t want to have to say I told you so…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna
get tropical?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Hey, sorry… He’s my friend, too. And that
ticket is not going to waste.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Julie, is everything cool? Karla said…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I said we start having fun. And that means
now.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Is there a problem here?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Where there’s a Will, there’s a way. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You know what? This rocks. We’re going to the
Bahamas!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: We goin’ Bahamas, I’m Ty’s Bahama Mama. We
goin’ Bahamas…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Just take deep breaths and think of something
happy from childhood.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What if I don’t have anything happy from
childhood…Sorry, I can’t relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four
thousand, four hundred feet a minute… Which is over seven hundred feet a
second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Deep breaths –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by
surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings…which
freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason
at all.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’ve got a better chance of getting hit by
lightning.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get
hit by meteors. They hit other planes.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Something is gonna hit your butt if you
don’t quit complaining.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Honey, some folks just can’t fly.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m the King of the World.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: No, I’m the King of the World.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Remind me to study real hard so someday this
is normal and all that back there is somethin’ I do for a weekend once
every ten years.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I will, and you remind me of the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You just gotta breathe.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Can’t talk right now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: See, it’s not a macho thing. It’s about
equilibrium in your inner ear. You could’ve used a patch, but it’s too
late now. Get used to it. Some folks just can’t sail.</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: That’s too bad, too, because it’s the only
way on or off the island. Unless you have an accident. And then they
call the Coast Guard.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s pretty remote here.</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: Yep. That’s what the tourists pay for –
sun, sea, and solitude.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Are we there yet?</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: Few more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I feel like I’m still on that thing.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: That way for a complimentary Planter’s
Punch to get you readjusted.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I can get used to this.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay. I’m
Derrick. At your service for the duration of your stay.</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: I’m at your service, Princess.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: Season’s over old man. So I gotta work
fast.</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: If Marine Radio’s right about the weather,
you’re already out of time.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>rasta voice</strong>: Anybudorsomethin’?</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: My brother, can I interest you in the islands
finest ganja?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Not possible.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: Who be wantin’ the kind, the uber- sticky,
the Bwana, The depth-charge, the Up-All-Night-Laughing-With-Your-
Friends? Who wants it? ’Cause Titus got it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: Come on, man. Everybody wants something.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Take a bath, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: That’s cold, but if that’s how you want
it.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Where is everyone? I’ll ask –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I’ll scare somebody up.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Checking in…Karla Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Ah, yes. Roll out the red carpet. Our
contest winners are here at last.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Nice dog.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Not really. I’ve found peices of guys like
you in his stool.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: What’s your problem, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I don’t have a problem in the world.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It sure is a beautiful old hotel.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Built in 1948 for a member of the
Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of
history in these walls…Judy Garland stayed here…Hemmingway fished for
marlin right off that dock –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Okay, we get it…It’s old.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: It’ll outlive you, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Oh, what?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: You’re in 201 and 202.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Is that bad?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Not at all. Those are our honeymoon
suites.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Your what?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven’t
exchanged vows, yet?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We haven’t exchanged anything.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie, we’re talkin’ suites! That’ll be just
fine with us.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: And, while you’re here, our marginally
trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Wait…Did you say off-season?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: July fourth weekend. Storm season starts
today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Storm season?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: It’s our version of winter. 201 and 202.
There’s Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Ain’t nothin’ free in this world. Everybody
says it, and it’s true. I wanted you all to have a good trip.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: We will, baby…All this means is we got the
whole island to ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And it’s been blue skies all day. It might be
perfect all weekend.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It beets being on the mainland.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Oooh, the mainland –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Somebody’s gone tropical on us, baby.
Tropical!</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: 201 and 202…Who put you in…? Don’t use these
much –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: No real reason. Pretty fancy rooms for kids
your age.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: We won a competition.</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: Oh, yeah? What you have to do?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Guess the capital of Brazil –</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Rio, baby!</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: Ahh, good for you, girl. …And, where would
you like me to put the bags?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Their stuff in there… …and ours in here.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Karla! You promised.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I also promised Tyrell.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Promised me what, baby? I made all my
promises to William.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Forward! A girl needs time to make up his
mind. Julie, look, if it’s cool, I’ll sleep on the couch and they can
have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ll take those.</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: No, I’ve been doing this since before you
were a dream in your father’s eye.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You sure it’s okay with you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Sure. It’s fine. As long as you don’t
snore.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of
hand.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He’s beaten up pretty bad –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes, but he seemed certain his friend was
killed out on the highway by somebody named Ben Willis. He said he has a
hook on his hand. He said he was driving a BMW.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Ray’s eyes pop open. He’s listening.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: There’s no body. And there was no other vehical
involved. He fell asleep at the wheel…and ran his old truck into a
guardrail. He got thrown way the hell down into a ditch. He’s damn
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He suffered a severe head trauma –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Probably once he rests up, it’ll all come back
to him.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: That’s your number twelve –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You guys lost?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Tell me this ain’t the bar scene.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Wanna drink?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We didn’t get all dressed up for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Planter’s Punch, Singapore Sling, or how
about a Mai-Tai?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: How about some ID?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The guy at the desk said the place would be
quiet, not dead.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Didn’t anyone tell you this is –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: The last day of the season. Yeah, we
heard.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So why are you still here?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: What’s the matter, boy trouble?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: He leave you?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No. I shot him.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Am I bad? I mean, he’s really great, and he’s
cute –</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: He’s cute…And he’s got a crush on you…
But…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I miss Ray…I tried to call him.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Ray made up his own mind…so, you’re free to
make up yours.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Pretty cool bar.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: They all start to look the same once you’ve
worked in one. Am I right, sister?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m Julie. This is Karla.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nancy. Welcome to Tower Bay’s most happenin’
hotspot.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Four Dark and Stormies…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: To a great weekend –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!</p>
<p><strong>karla &amp; julie</strong>: I’ll drink to that!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: So what do you do around here for fun?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Make fun of tourists mainly. Or let them make
fun of themselves…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Karaoke – perfect.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Don’t even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Okay, I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Go baby! Go!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Oh, this ain’t for me, baby, this is for
somebody who really needs it. Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Everyone thinks their a singer.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Not me…no way…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Come on, it’ll be fun.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands
together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.</p>
<p><strong>karla, tyrell, &amp; will</strong>: Ju-lie! Ju-lie!
Ju-lie!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You asked for it. Song number
thirty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Julie? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s…him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do you mean, Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He did something to the screen…it, it,
said…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There’s no way…just stop it right now…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, Will! I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have…I didn’t
think…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, no, no. This was really sweet…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I scared you – I crossed the line –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No – it’s not that. It’s…I’m just a little on
edge. I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hey, you don’t have to appologize to me. I’m
the one. I understand. I’m going to take a walk and dry off.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Are you sure? I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I just really like you and I want you to feel
good about everything…You know? I want you to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Dork.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Tha’s it. I’ve decided. I’m changing my major
to finance. And going to Wall Street.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: ’Cause that’s the only way I’m ever gonna be
able to afford a big bed like this.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Ah, baby, let’s stay right here.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I spent a hundred bucks on it…even if it’s
just so you can pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I like the sound of this.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: Damn. I should’ve brought my pole.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: Get lost, you scared me.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: Fish are all over the water…Come on, let us
take a boat out.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: Titus, you’re so stoned, you’d end up in
Spain.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: That’s why you’ll come with Titus, mon.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: There’s a storm comin’, Titus. No boats are
going out.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why
all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: I got work to do. Take the bake
elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: Up-tighteous and self-righteous.</p>
<p><strong>derrick</strong>: Hello, little sea bass. You’re lucky I’m
busy or I’d hook you myself.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: You sure you didn’t pick up my hair tie?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Okay, I just didn’t wanna get my hair
wet.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Baby, I finally got you alone in this
Jacuzzi and I don’t wanna be discussin’ hair care.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Don’t you get feisty…</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Too late for that. We’re miles from
anywhere, baby. No one’s gonna hear you scream.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I used to be a lifeguard…I’d hate to have to
blow my whistle.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I’d hate for you to have to blow…your
whistle.</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: No water sports after midnight. Hotel
policy.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: What’s the policy on burnin’ herb?</p>
<p><strong>titus</strong>: We got one for that, too. It’s don’t try
until you buy. You don’t buy any, you don’t get any.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: There’s ten people on this whole island and
they’re all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How’s the water?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Crowded.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Ty!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ahh, that feels great.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: How’s Julie?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Alone. In the room. Got any advise?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta just get
back up there and keep swingin’.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I need an international operator.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Will…?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Will?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s happening again! There’s a body!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What? What are you talking about? Where?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s in my room!</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I don’t find this at all funny.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There was a body! I swear it!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were
dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I wasn’t dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I knew you people were goining to be
trouble. I knew from the first time I laid eyes on you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Listen to me. He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Who? Who is here?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Julie thinks there’s a dead guy in the
closet.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: The rest of us see bathrobes.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right
there.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Fine. Show me the body.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Think about this, Julie. What did you
actually see?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up
there.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: In the morning we’ll talk to Derrick, the
“dockhand guy,” and put the whole thing to rest. Now, let’s slow down on
the Dark and Stormies and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Don’t look at me –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I want off this island.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Not possible, I’m afraid. The last ferry
left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won’t be another one
for days.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: There’s a storm coming?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: ’Tis the season, like I told you. It’s a big
one.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then I’ll call the mainland for a
charter.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Phones went down a few minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be
rough, but we’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: What about a radio?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: Sorry. Emergencies only.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: What the hell would you call this?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: I’d call this four spoiled city kids who
wouldn’t know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. All we can do now
is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there’s a
storm shelter.</p>
<p><strong>olga</strong>: Housekeeping. Housekeeping.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Jeez, that’s a full carat –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well, there’s some flaws in her…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Don’t really have the market for something like
this… I can go two…two-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Make it three hundred. And throw that in,
too.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Hell, that’s worth three, easy. And you got
your waiting period.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not waiting…So give me the gun and keep the
ring.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Fine, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is it loaded?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: This ain’t the romantic weekend I had in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: You get any sleep at all?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Some.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Oh, look. Another day in paradise with
Julie-your-tour-director…Miss Psychotic Episode.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Hey –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh
kill? How ’bout Freddy, Jason?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I’m just saying what all of you are
thinking. It’s bad enough gettin’ rained out without having to hold her
hand the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You don’t have to be a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s okay…He doesn’t believe me. That’s his
right. I’m starting to think I’m crazy, too.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up
in there…What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little
stress?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Nice move.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I’ll be givin’ your fisherman some of that
and see how he likes it.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They’re all dead…Dead, I tell you. Ahhhh,
we’re all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hello? There’s nobody here, Tyrell.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: They’re around…They just don’t care about us
’cause we’re the contest winners. Let’s go find Stoner Boy…Make his lazy
butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or
something.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the
gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a
dramatic increase in tropical depression –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Hey – shut up, okay?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t like to fish.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Come on, Vampira. I got just the thing for
you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Cancer in a box.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: No, this is the safe sun. It’s better than a
day at the beach.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Houseplant.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Karla!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Hey, Bong Marley. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I’m gonna kill you, Bong Boy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Come on. Jump. I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Thanks. I gotta find me a pool boy.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Gee, Karla…That’ll break the machine…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You say something?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Take this.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And do what with it?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Julienne of pool boy.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Hey, pool boy.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: What the – ?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s chlorine and muriatic acid. Put the two
together and you get cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Cyanide? Like poison gas? You mean, somebody
really killed him…Omigod. Think…Think…</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Get back –</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, God, get me out. Get me out.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Hang on…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m not crazy…I’m not crazy. He’s here… We’ve
got to get to the radio and call for help.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I think we can classify this as an emergency
situation.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Yo, Brooks, listen up – Whoa –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Somebody…is a sick, fingerpainting
psycho.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: We gotta get out of here. Now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Julie!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: There were boats here? Refresh my memory,
there were boats…</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: They were cut loose.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on
here?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We’re all going to die. He’s going to kill us
one by one.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ben Willis.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Oh, stop it! He’s dead. You killed him. Now,
get over it. We gotta think here.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: They never found the body.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Only he wasn’t dead. He killed Barry and
Helen last July Fourth.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: We’re on an island, miles from anywhere. I
don’t give a crap about you’re fisherman. There’s dead bodies pilling up
everywhere and there’s one guy missing –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The porter…what’s his name? Old Asbestos –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Estes! That’s exactly who it is. That old
guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or
we can go find him first.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie, we have to do something.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s not him.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: People live healthy in Miami. It’s the
future down there every day of the week…The future.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll keep that in mind.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Yo, Freak Boy –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: We’re gonna find some weird crap in
here.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Voodoo.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Missing a hair tie?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: We found our guy.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: We gotta find flashlights, torches, guns if
they got ’em, anything that’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Wait. Maybe he’s down there collecting the
body parts.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’ll only be a second, okay?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Yeah, wait right here, it’s the safest
place.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>will/estes/tyrell</strong>: Let go. I got him. That’s me.
It’s him. We got you…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Here’s youre killer –</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We found your voodoo crap –</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Let him go. I believe him.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Come on, Julie. You saw his room.</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: I haven’t hurt anyone…I stole those things to
help you. To protect you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s telling the truth. He could’ve easily
killed me. He didn’t. Look, we didn’t even answer the radio question
right…This whole thing was a setup.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Rio isn’t the capital of Brazil. It was the
wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: You’ve got all these theories but where is
he? Where? Where’s your fisherman killer?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: You never do…The guy at the nightclub, the
body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to
you. How do we even know you’re not the one behind this –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: How do we know you’re not?</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: I know who you’re talking about. He used to
work here at the hotel. And I’ve seen him around again. Out in the woods
by the orchard.</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: I can’t remeber his name, but I don’t forget
a face. I can show you…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How do we know you’re not setting us up?</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: Where else you gonna go, son?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I know I don’t want to stay in here.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We’ll be better off in the open. If we stick
together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Show us.</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I need to get to Tower Bay Island.</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: We’re closed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I need to get there, now.</p>
<p><strong>paulsen</strong>: Did you happen to notice what’s going on
outside?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not looking for a weather report, I’m
looking for a boat. So which one’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: He worked here for many years. He had a nice
family. A pretty wife and two little ones. A boy and a girl. They’d be
about your age, now.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Did he do it?</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: People say she was running around on him.
People say he caught her in bed with other men. People say a lot of
things. He disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. At least
they were never found.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Be careful, Julie.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ve got to see.</p>
<p><strong>julie james</strong>: born September 6, 1979 died July 4,
1998 “A Lying Whore”</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: …Today’s July fourth.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m not dying on this island, Will. Do you
hear me?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are
down. There’s no way off this place.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Then, we fight –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where’d Estes go?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: What is up with that weirdo?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ll go find him.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Why? He can’t help us.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He’s probably the only one who can help
us.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Are you crazy? We’re not staying here on our
own.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s okay. He couldn’t have gone far. I’ll
catch up with you later.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a
tree?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I’m not hiding up no tree. I’m with her.
Let’s arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho’s butt.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: What I need is a gun. Not a steak knife.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I’m your best friend…You could have told me
the truth about what happened. I would’ve understood.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be
over. I didn’t want to involve anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: It’s too late for that.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m so sorry. I brought this on everyone.
It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Forget that. You didn’t do nothing. This
fisherman’s a piece of scum. I should’ve been listening to you… I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: You think that’s a good place to hide?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: I don’t know, but I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Hey Estes. Estes? Where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: This has to end. Now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What – ?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Steel door…Food…Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: It’s just a –</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Ty!</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Don’t kill me –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Wait, it’s Nancy –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m sorry, but you could’ve been the one
doing all of this –</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: And so could you – crazy fool.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You stumbled into my hiding place.</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Must have missed the sign.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Excuse me, but this island didn’t have a
murder rate until you people showed up. I’ve never seen a dead body
before.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who’s doing this?</p>
<p><strong>tyrell</strong>: Don’t even get her started…It’s a long, long
story and you probably wouldn’t believe a word of it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come in…This is Summer Breeze requesting
emergency assistance for Tower Bay island. I repeat…This is Summer
Breeze…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I know where we can hide.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Give me a boost up –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There’s no way to lock it.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: There’s no way to grip this thing.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Watch your step…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’d be amazed by what you’d see. My wife with
every man on the island, for example. And you, sexy…I loved watching
you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You sick freak.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Oh, god, no –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Karla!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Oww…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: It’s locked!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s gotta be one of these.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Please! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Nancy…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s jammed!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Come on!!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No way!!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Come on, gimme a shot –</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie, come on.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Come on, you can make it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: There’s a light somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Julie?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m right here. Grab my hand.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: This place has emergency power. Just ease you
way down the stairs and I’ll find the light.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Okay. I’m at the bottom. Karla, just get my
hand.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I’m holding your hand!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: …Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: All right –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s you guys, thank god. Is everyone
okay?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Help’s here. Help’s here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Come on. We’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Did you get help?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s in it with Willis?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Your stomach, you’re hurt –</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: When I was coming back I saw your slicker
friend looking for you guys down by the water. Let’s hurry and get
inside…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, my god, you’re bleeding to death.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I saw one in the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’ll be okay. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Will, just hold on. We’ll get you fixed
up.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Look up there. I’ll look over here.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’ve got blood everywhere, but I can’t find
the wound.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s because it’s not my blood.</p>
<p><strong>estes</strong>: Will…He’s in on it. He’s –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Look at the bright side, Jules. We finally get
to spend some quality time together.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Me, me, me. It’s always about you. I’m having
bad dreams. I can’t sleep. I’m not doing well in school. I’m having
trouble with my boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I trusted you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We had a connection, didn’t we? I can tell you
one thing, though. Ray didn’t trust me. He was right. He’s dead, but he
was right.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: …Why?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You’ll get it.
Will Benson – Ben’s son.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s my boy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, no, no –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shush, now. No more screaming…No more running.
Time to die.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You gotta be kiddin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’re you gonna do, boy? Call us names?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Let her go. Now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Think about it, boy. You’re no killer. That’s
my job.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Stop right there.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You don’t have it in you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We haven’t missed you down here, Ray boy. I
got to know Julie real well.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Gonna blind you first.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Just…Die.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You can’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Oh, god, it’s you –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re okay. Thank god.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Is he?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We don’t have to tell anyone it rained the
whole time. It can just be our little secret.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ray…what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh…it’s not working right. You’re home early.
Did I scare you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Never do that again.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey – I didn’t know you were here. It’s okay.
We got the refrigerator in. Come see.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I love it here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s gonna be great.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Checking the locks again?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You know me to well.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What is my problem?</p>
