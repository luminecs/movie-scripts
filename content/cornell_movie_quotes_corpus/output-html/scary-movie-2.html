<p><strong>harris</strong>: Who knows this one?… “WHO LET THE DOGS
OUT?!”</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You’re going to die.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m sorry. She’s been really sick.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No! Bad girl! Bad girl!</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Hey you, pay your fare.</p>

<p><strong>mother</strong>: Father, come in, please.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m so glad you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: I came as fast as I could, but at my
age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin.
If I tickle my ass before…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s okay. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: She’s gotten worse, Father. She won’t eat,
she won’t talk. The child won’t even let me touch her.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Yes… Sometimes you have to give them
candy.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Not unless you have a paternity test
to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: No, I was sent by the church to assist you.
My name is Father Harris.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Would you like to see the girl?</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Soon. First, I must bless this
house.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Lord, please help me to release this
demon.</p>

<p><strong>demonic voice</strong>: Get out!!! You fuckin’ pig!!!</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Father, are you okay?</p>

match before you go in there. Did you bring my bag?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Then let us prepare.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Remember, don’t ask her too many
questions.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Because she will lie?</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: No, because her breath smells like a
horse’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Shove it up your ass. You worthless piece of
shit!</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Silence!!</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Look, my child. We’ve come to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>megan/demon</strong>: Your mother’s in here with us, Harris.
Would you like to leave a message? I’ll see that she gets it.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: If that’s true, then you must know my
mother’s name. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: That’s right. Blanche was my mother’s name.
You are the devil.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: It burns! It burns!</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Damn Tijuana hooker.</p>
<p><strong>mcfeely/harris</strong>: Our Father who art in Heaven…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Your mother sucks cock in Hell, Harris.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Oh shit, you gonna take that?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: What she said about your mother?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Oh, yeah, well your mama got one leg and
does jumping jacks like this.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: So, your mama’s so fat when she walks by my
bed, it does this.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: What about your mama? Her butt is so big,
she wipes her ass like this.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Enough! Begone from this child of God. I
command you by the power of the living and the dead…</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: …to leave the young servant so that she may
return to her…</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: In the name of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit, I cast you out.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Father, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: This is some good shit.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: My holy water.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Ahhh, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: The power of Christ compels you!</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: The power of Christ compels you!</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: The power of Chrishht compelshh
yooo.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Power of compelshh Chrishhts you, or
something…</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: David Blaine, kiss my ass.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Father, I think you should rest.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: No, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: I must have dozed off.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Look what you’ve done!</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Take me! Take me!</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Take me! God damn you, take me!</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Nooooo!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You failed, McFeely. Your weapons are useless
against me.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: You’re mistaken my child. The Lord
has greater weapons than me.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: Hear the word of the Lord and be
humbled!</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: See the cross of the Lord and
tremble! If ye still not have faith, then…</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: …suck on this!!!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Come on. Move it.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Come on, peg legs. I ain’t got all day.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hey, sweetie, ever heard of a gym? I’ve seen
pool sticks bigger than those thighs.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Sorry, but the fastest feet win.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: So, do you think you made it into the
class?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I don’t know, but I sure hope so.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You could use the grade, huh?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you
like being in college?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Okay, I guess. It’s so intimidating. You know
being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek
sometimes. Everyone’s so cool and I’m so not.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Aww, you ain’t that bad. You just need a
little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Gear. You know, clothing.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Let’s start with some rhythm. Sway back and
forth like this.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yeah, something like that. Now, go left,
right, left, right, crossover kick…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Left, right, left, right, crossover kick…</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Now you gotta learn the correct slang.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yo! That jacket is tight.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all
together.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Left…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: POW!!!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Crossover kick…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Uhn! That jacket is tight. Now run that shit,
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Am I cool now?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Almost… Look, I gotta bounce. I’ll holla at
you later.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey, man, you two boners aren’t ready yet?
We’re gonna miss the bus, Ray. Coach says if our GPA drops below 2 we’re
off the squad.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll make it. Say, what do you
guys think, tucked in or out?</p>
<p><strong>buddy/tommy</strong>: Out!!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No doubt. That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: If you two hadn’t been out partying last
night, you’d be ready by now.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It was awesome, dudes. We got fucking wasted.
I had like a whole keg. Dude, I was so shitfaced. I woke up naked in a
tub of ice.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I woke up naked, too.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It says, “Ray.”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Get out?! What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: “Fucked me.”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Aww. Cool. Dude.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “Ray!”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: “Fucked me.”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “Ray!”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: “Fucked me.”</p>
<p><strong>tommy/ray</strong>: “Ray fucked me.”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Wedgy moment.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Totally got me, fuck.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Come on, dude. We’re gonna be late.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: See you later, man.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s it! I don’t want to be treated like
this anymore. It’s over. Goodbye. Have a nice life.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, I’m fine. I just broke up with my
boyfriend, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That’s always tough. How long were you
together?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, we never made it official, so I guess we
were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing
him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too
nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted
down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I
went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be
nice ’cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to
work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I
say borrowed because I’m going to give it back one day. But anyway, I
called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn’t home when I called
so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I
wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called
back. I’d call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining
orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you
have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: No, I haven’t dated in a while. My last
boyfriend’s…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, look there. My friend Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Okay, here’s your loan check. Your grant
check. Your disability check. And oh, a block of government cheese.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, actually, we’ve never met officially,
but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said,
“I’m sorry,” and you said, “Watch it, white bitch, or I’ll put my size
eight in your ass.” I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too.
Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I
would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet
today.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Really? That’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: You better be careful. I heard some girl got
her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. Hey, what class do we
have next?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Psychology.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Me, too. 101?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: In room “302” at ten o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Oh, this is too much. I’m gonna have to play
these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Wait, don’t split the pole. It’s bad
luck.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You don’t really believe that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Oh yes, girl. After my near-death
experience, I’ve become very spiritual. I can feel my angels all around
me, Oh, look a penny…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: That’s good luck. Wait, let me make a wish
and throw it in the fountain. I wish for a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Oh, look, it worked.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: God is good, y’all</p>
<p><strong>ext. college campus – establishing shot – a short
time</strong>: LATER</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: There you go my man.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hey, pal, I can handle a door by myself.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>student #2</strong>: Are you okay? Let me help you to the
handicapped ramp.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I am not handicapped! I can use the steps
like anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s one more than last week!</p>
<p><strong>int. science building - professor oldman’s office - a
short</strong>: TIME LATER</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I finished all the interviews.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Let me see the files.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: They’re on top of the bookshelf. I’ll get
them.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I don’t need your help. I’m perfectly
capable.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Here you go, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Are these all the subjects?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey
Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Any of them hot?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I also took the liberty of putting those
with near-death experiences on top.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds
are a sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: As I am sure you are aware, Professor,
subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have
the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of
course, why I’ve given them special consideration.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more
they’re hurtin’, the more they need a squirtin’, if you know what I
mean. Ooh, I like her.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned
personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Willing? I like that. And, this one?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s Ray Williams. I couldn’t quite figure
him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh, that’s the picture he sent me after our
interview.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Car accident, gun shot, multiple
stabbings, a hook through the back… Where did you find these kids?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: They are the survivors of the Steveston
County massacre.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Fantastic. These kids are exactly the
kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: How are we going to get them all up
there?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: I’ll make it part of the class. We’ll
tell them they’re participating in a study on sleep disorders.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And what happens when all hell breaks
loose?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: We record and document it. We’re gonna
make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life
after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I’ll be rich,
and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time
is orientation?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: In about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Remember, Dwight, not a word to
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Whoa! Who laid one?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Whoever smelt it, dealt it.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Open chest.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Loose nuts. You better hide them.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What? You guys don’t know this game?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Dude, look out.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m sorry, I should have been watching where
I…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s the sequel.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen, no need for you to worry. All that
stuff that happened before is behind us. Let’s just try to move on.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I am. So just do me a favor and stay away
from me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hello Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hello Ray.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Welcome everyone. I’m Professor Oldman.
All of you have been carefully selected to be in this class. This course
is very unique in that each semester my students take part in a bona
fide study for which they receive an automatic grade of “A” upon
completion. This semester’s study is insomnia. All of you have some kind
of sleep disorder that we will attempt to resolve or at least find the
origin to.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Excuse me, but I don’t have a sleep
disorder.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: It’s okay. You have a “D-cup.” You’re in
the right place.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: My assistant, Dwight, will be passing out
directions to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Would you like me to help you pass them
back?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I don’t need your help.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: You should arrive no later than 6PM
tonight, and plan to be there until Monday. That’s it for now. I’ll see
you all this evening.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey, you left your book back there.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Thanks. I’m Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: So, I see you’re really into spooks.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: No. I never date outside my race.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I meant you’re into ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, yeah. I’m just curious about that kind of
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: So it looks like we’re going to be spending
the weekend together.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Maybe we can study together or something.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but
I’m just getting over a really bad relationship, and I’m not ready to
start dating yet.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: But, hey, maybe we can be friends.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Sure, that would be cool. Friends.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Okay. See you later, friend.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Wedgy!!!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Smell you later! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Hey, will you shut the fuck up and let me
sing?!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: No new messages.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Checkmate. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Is anybody here?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I was told there’d be somebody here.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hello? Your test results are in.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh my God! I’m here with the…</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Yes, Professor Oldman’s group. Forgive me. I
didn’t mean to frighten you.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: My aren’t you a lovely child.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: And what is your name?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: I’m Hanson the caretaker.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: I’ll show you to your room. Let me help you
with that.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Whoa, that’s heavy. I better use my strong
hand.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: I’m so sorry. I’ll get them.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I have taken care of everything, including
medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Right. What about condoms?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Professor!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Hey, you’re the one who brought up
safety. I’m perfectly willing to go in raw.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Would you please focus?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Fine. What’s all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, this measures the amount of thermal
imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Are those cameras all throughout the
house?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yes, I thought that it would be best.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Even in the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: So, if one of our little chickadees is
taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close-
up?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: After dinner, you and I will take shifts
throughout the night. I don’t want to chance miss anything.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Excuse me, sir, but the students have
started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Thanks, handyman.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: I’m the caretaker, not the handyman. Nice
skates. Be careful. You don’t want to fall and break something.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: I’m going to change for dinner. I’ll see
you shortly.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Sounds good. I’m just going to run up to my
room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I’ll be right
there.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hi guys.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Hey. What’s Up? Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Hey guys!</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Hi Theo!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hi Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Open chest!!!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Gotta be quicker than that, “A-cup!”</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Well, are you boys just gonna stand there with
your mouths open, or is somebody gonna offer me a seat?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: It’s the best seat in the house. I warmed it
up for you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Second best.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Professor, is this the same house that a
young girl was possessed by a demon or something?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Yes, it was reported, but never
substantiated.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yeah, just like that charges regarding me
and that blind Haitian girl.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Pass me the salt.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Keepin’ evil spirits away. And if that don’t
work I always got this.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Not to worry. There’s been no reported
activity in the house for over twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Let’s not forget, folks, this is a study on
sleep disorders.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here
thinks they’d wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started
sniffing between their legs?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Enough spooky stuff. Let’s eat.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Well ain’t we gonna bless this food
first?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Allow me… God is good, God is great, but not
all the time. Sometimes he could be a real asshole, because it seems as
though every time I try to establish a relationship with him, he never
returns my calls. I’ve been praying for twenty-four years and I haven’t
heard his voice yet. Not one message on my answering machine. Your
miracles don’t impress me. It’s your quality time I want. So, if you
hear me, and I know you’re up there, thanks for the food. It’s the least
you can do. In Jesus’ name, don’t let me get started on him, Amen.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Anyone care for appetizers?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Finger food?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: How about these buns?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, they’re so warm and soft.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Ray!!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, my bad.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Sure, I’ll just set them down and you can
help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Ummm!! They smell delicious.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Thanks. I made them by hand.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: The potatoes are just about ready. Let me
just go whip them up real good.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Ah, that’s good. Dig in.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: And now for the turkey.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Say, what do you say you let me do that? You
just relax. You’ve done enough.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Oh, nonsense. It’s my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: You know, making a turkey is a real art. The
trick is in the stuffing. A lot of people are afraid to get their hands
dirty. Not me. When I stuff it, I like to get the whole hand up in
there. And you know I use a secret ingredient in the stuffing…</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Who’s first? Anyone like a wing?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yours, or the turkeys?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: I supposed you’d like a leg. How about
two?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s it. I’m gonna put my food in your
ass. I should warn you, I’m a black belt in karate.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: You don’t scare me. I was a Golden Gloves
champion.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Relax, Dwight. I got an idea. Is there
anything you didn’t make?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Well, the dessert. I ordered out.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Great. What do you say we just skip the
heavy stuff and go straight to the dessert?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Well, I guess if that’s what you all
wish.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: My germs!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: My germs! Ha, ha!</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: My germs! Ha, ha!</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Funny, I always win that game.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: What can I get for you, boys?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yo, I’ll take a “Sex on the Beach.”</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Professor?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Make mine a “Screaming Orgasm.”</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Ray, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Balls on My Chin… What, you out of “Bacardi?”
Fine, give me a “Mud Slide.”</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Professor, what’s the history of this
house?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: I’m glad you asked. It actually makes for
a pretty good bedtime story.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Gather around.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: This house was built in 1898 by a man
named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora… Keaton… I
am here to communicate…</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No, they sold the house in 1920 to a
millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil
presence.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No, he lost the house after the stock
market crash.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: But he could still be haunting the house.
He’s angry that he had to leave.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: He’s not dead, you idiot. He lives in
Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Anyway, the last owner was a very rich
man who built his empire off the blood and sweat of the people in this
town. He lived like a king until one day the servants of the house
killed him.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I think there’s more to the story. I can
feel something evil in the house. It’s all around. In the wall, the
floor, this piano…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Ouch!!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: No, you don’t understand. It’s here in these
statues…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: This clock…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: This mirror…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: These…</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: NO!!!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: You’re right. Not in the knives.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: It’s in the guns.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: My God! Is she dead?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No, they’re just powder burns, thank God.
They were empty. Get her upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Maybe this house is possessed.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No such thing. What you all witnessed was
psychosomatic, purely self-induced reactions brought on by hysteria. Now
I want everyone to get some rest. We will start our testing in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: The group responded beyond expectation.
Cindy and Brenda seemed most susceptible to the suggestion of horror.
Brenda exhibiting both delusion and hysteria. Group fear should manifest
itself and intensify as the night progresses.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Professor, I think you should see this.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot?
What?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: No, these are the tapes from the living
room. Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: The image there.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Are you sure it’s not the tape?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I don’t think so. It’s on all the cameras,
and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten
degrees when the image was recorded.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Congratulations, Dwight, it’s begun.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh no, little bird.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Oh, my bad.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Aww, the little bird died.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yeah, I didn’t know what else to do.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Hey, I got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That was a great idea, Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I told you it would taste just like
chicken.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Uh, uh.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You better go get Dwight and the
Professor.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Alright, Cindy, what’s so important?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight,
come here.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Just wait, you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yippie! Wasn’t that amazing?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: It’s some kind of energy field. We better
record this.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Got my camera right here.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I got it!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: That’s fantastic. Our first phenomenon.
This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep.
Dwight and I will take over from here.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Hello, hello?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Oh, my. How long has that been there?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Oh, I need a pedicure.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Shit, forgot my clippers. Aw, fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Huh? Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Ahhh, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Whew, not fresh are we?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Whew. I was holding that one in all day.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Cindy… Cindy Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Cindy… Cindy…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Who is it? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Help us Cindy. Help us.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Help you how?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Check the music room.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Think fast.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Dude, you suck.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You know, Buddy, about this friendship
thing…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah, it’s great, isn’t it. I think it’s so
cool… have a girl as a friend.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That’s just it, Buddy. I’m a girl. You can’t
be so rough with me.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Then what kinda stuff can we do?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts
and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It sounds gay, but guess since you’re a girl
it’s okay, huh?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check
something out. Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Sure. We can practice talking.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: So, this hot Spanish chick is licking my
balls and I’m fingerbanging her, right, just then…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Buddy…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Wait, I’m just about to tell you the best
part.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh my God. Look.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Dude, somebody’s on the rag.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: It must be a private study, or something.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: There’s more to the story of this house than
the Professor told us. It says here that Hugh Kane had a wife who died
mysteriously a week before the servants killed him.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Wow, she’s beautiful. You really think she
looks like me?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Her hair doesn’t have as many split ends at
yours. Her skin isn’t as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your
eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down’s Syndrome
or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Oh yeah… another difference is she looks more
sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not
pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Buddy, look at this. I think it belonged to
her.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Come on, let’s get out of here. This place is
giving me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Shhh… It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Ray, have you been here all this time?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just wanted to make sure you were okay.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I’m fine. Just a few bruises.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So, I guess I can go now.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: No, stay.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Yeah, I think I’ll feel better sleeping in
the arms of a strong man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I’m gonna take a shower. I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Damn, it’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>clown doll</strong>: Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, you want to play!</p>
<p><strong>clown doll</strong>: Hey, stop that? Homey don’t play
that.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!</p>
<p><strong>clown doll</strong>: No! No! Noooooo!!!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Are you okay? I thought I heard
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, I’m fine… just clowning around.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Mmph! Mmph!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Somebody help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh! Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, my God. Yes! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oooh. Oooh. Rug burn. Rug burn.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hey, kitty, kitty. How you doin’ girl?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Here, kitty, kitty. Look…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Go get it.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Come on. We better get you cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m telling you, it was possessed.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Theo, did you see the animal?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got
there I guess it was gone.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What, you think I did this to myself?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No, I’m just saying cats are known to be
very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn’t
mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What are you getting at, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Only that if this cat did attack, he’s
less likely to come back if the two of you were, let’s say, together.
Come on, it’s college. Time for you two to experiment.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Cindy, I don’t think we’re going to get any
help here.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Actually, I’d be more than willing to
walk you through it.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Come, Cin, I’ll make sure you’re tucked
in.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Good idea, and don’t forget to give her a
good-night kiss.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: There’s something going on in this house. I’m
not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Good-night, Cin. I’ll be next door if you need
me.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Thanks, I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hello, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Hello, Cindy…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Forbidden fruit.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Got a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What’s
gotten into you?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Gock – gock – gock…</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Ooo, yes.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Ohh… mmm…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: There. That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: I take it you’re not mad at me.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I wouldn’t go that far.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: I don’t like this, this…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Why don’t you shut up, Professor? Just
relax.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I think she’s starting to suspect
something?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Your wife!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came
home. She saw them.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Saw who?!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Don’t touch me!!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What the hell?!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: It’s not what is looks like. She’s having
a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Professor, we need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What is it, Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I think we should consider cutting the
experiment short.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: The force in this house is far greater than
I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic
fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: That’s why we came here, remember?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yes, but I’ve seen the tapes. This
poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in
danger. I say we pull the plug.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the
plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we’re on the verge of greatness
and I’m about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on
Monday. Until then no one leaves.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Now, here are the keys to the gate and
the cell phone. No one gets access to either, understand?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I can’t sleep like this.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They done killed my baby! Why Lord?! Why?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Ah, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I know what I need.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hello?… Ghost?… Baby, are you there?… I’ve
been waiting on you for almost ten minutes now! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, ghost of the night, I beseech thee. Oh
fickle fleeting ghost of the night, I beseech thee.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Ahhh!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Wilson! Wilson! Wilson!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: One one thousand. Two one thousand. Three
one thousand.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Tonight, Hugh and I made love for the first
time. Ha, ha, ha, talk about little. I can’t take living with him any
longer. He’s becoming a monster. Darkness is all around us. Poor Hanson
died today; burned alive in the furnace. They say it was an accident,
but…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Help! somebody help!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Help! Help! He’s trying to smoke me,
son!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Oh my God, Cindy!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You cheating son of a bitch! Touch her and
I’ll make sure that’s the last piece of possession you have. You son of
a bitch! Oh, what you gonna play like this? I know you didn’t do
that!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What, one woman isn’t enough for you? Must you
channel every girl in this house? How would you like it if I fucked
another ghost, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Where do you think you’re going? This isn’t
finished. That’s just like you, every time things get serious you
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t forget! I know where you rot! Selfish
bastard. All you entities are the same.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ask your poltergeist stealing whore!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: She’s in shock. We have to get her in a tub
of water.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: She’s okay. She won’t be able to move for
awhile. Her body has to recover from the trauma. Just leave her
here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I say we leave now.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Wait. I’m sensing someone else in
danger.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Don’t start that shit again!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Look, a note.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: “Help, I’m drowning – Cindy.”</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Cindy!!!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Now we got everybody. Let’s get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Damn, it smells good.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s for someone special.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I’m glad somebody got laid.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I never kiss and tell.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yo, there’s some freaky shit in this house.
Y’all hear that loud banging and screaming?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Brenda was right. There’s more to the story
than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news
clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ah, they just don’t know you the way I do.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I found a picture of his wife.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Wife?!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let that bitch make you breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Wow! She looks just like you… except she
doesn’t have as many split ends as you and her skin isn’t as oily.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, and sometimes your eyes get all squinty
and it looks like you got Down’s Syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Yeah, girl, damn near twins… except she’s
more sophisticated and classy. You got that cute, trailer park look.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: No doubt… and her tits are perfect, not at
all pointy or funny looking. You got them National Geographic orangutan
titties.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Okay, I get the point.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: So, whatever happened to her?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: She killed herself a week before he died.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, he was a widower. Why didn’t you say
that?… Don’t worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I think he wants me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ha! Right bitch!</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Cindy, that does sound a little crazy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: She’s not crazy. I saw the picture, and I’ll
tell you guys something else, the Professor is up to something. Him and
Dwight got a whole lab set up in the basement. We’re here for an
experiment, alright, but it ain’t insomnia. I heard Dwight tell the
Professor there’s a poltergeist in this house and we could be in
danger.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: What? I’m getting outta here.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We can’t leave. The gates are locked and
Dwight is the only one with the keys.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Don’t worry. Give me five minutes alone with
Dwight. I’ll get the keys.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Hello Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: What are you working on?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Just a little experiment.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Well, there’s a lot riding on this
project.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: The Professor might have everyone else fooled,
but I know who the real brains of the operation is.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You do.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: That’s what turns me on about you, Dwight.
You’re so smart.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And sexy.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Of course. So sexy.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do
you use on it?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Just a little Rogaine.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: And those sexy eyes.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: What do you say we put on some music?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: What do you say we make our own music?</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: You know, Dwight, I hear you’re the only one
who has the key to the gate.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: What if I wanted to borrow those keys?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Oh, I couldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Sure you can, baby. Look, you help by giving
me the keys, and I’ll help by giving you…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I don’t need your help. I can do it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: I got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Great! We should leave before it starts to
rain.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: I say we wait till the rain lets up, then we
make a break for it.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: This just in… Heavy rains will continue
to plague the region for the next two days.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: We’ll just call a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Now, an update on the recent taxi
strike. No progress in sight.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hey, we can take my car.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: There’s been a major recall on all
Japanese made cars. Auto makers warn when exposed to rain the cars
explode.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fuck it. We’ll hike if we have to.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: The bodies of six hikers were found
today torn to shreds by wild animals.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I know, we can build a plane and fly outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Now, that’s just fucking stupid.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Alright then, we’ll just hunker down for
tonight. Maybe we’ll get a break by morning.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Dwight, what the hell are you doing?
Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Now that’s a talent. Dwight, wake up.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I can do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to
teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: The keys. She took the keys.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Shit. They’re onto us. Keep an eye on
them. I’ll take care of this little shit.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I think we got the one’s up here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I think it’s time we had a little talk with the
Professor.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Hello?… Have we met?… Hi…</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Ummmm… Hello?… Umm…</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Ummm… Are you Mrs. Hanson? Ummm… Who are
you, you gorgeous creature?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Hello?… Hello? Are you hiding? Where are
you, sexy pants?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What the hell? I’ve done worse.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: This one goes out to that someone special from
Alex over at the Hell House. She says that even though you two have only
known each other for a short time now, she feels a certain connection to
you that she’s never felt with any man alive. And even if it doesn’t
work out between you two, she wants you to know that there will always
be a special place for you in the heart. So, Poltergeist, this one’s for
you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well, I’m going to sleep now. So, if there’s
some ghostly man out there who wants to take advantage of me, there’s
probably nothing that I will be able to do about it because I’m really a
heavy sleeper! Okay, here I go.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’m asleep now. I really am.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: He won’t let us go. He’s going to kill
us.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Quick, everyone to the lab.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Those steps look kind of hard. I’m gonna
need some help.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Don’t mind me. Save yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Quick. Lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: We have to destroy him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How we gonna destroy what we can’t see?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I got it! We shave off our pubic hairs and
use the shampoo for ten days. What? Ya’ll never had crabs?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ghosts are just energy fields. We can
capture that energy. We can dissipate it! But in order to do that, we’ve
got to get him in here. On that spot.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: That’s great Einstein. How are we gonna do
that? There’s a powerful force out there ready to render us helpless,
tear on our flesh, and penetrate our bodies.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s right. I should go first.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: He’s so brave.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: These are highly experimental guns that emit
a bolt of concentrated energy able to damage ectoplasmic cells, giving
it the ability to injure or even destroy a ghost. There is no
ammunition. You only get three shots a piece, so use it very wisely.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Conserve your ammunition!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Sorry… right, right…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: The only way we’re going to track down these
ghosts is if we’re all wearing one of these…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: A dick pump?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I mean these!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: These are thermo-goggles.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: These can be used to track the ghosts. These
goggles work on the principle of body heat. They’re so powerful, they’ll
even show where body fluids of any kind have been recently, even if it
been wiped clean.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: He may be invisible, but we have the
advantage of being armed with the most innovative and complex high- tech
equipment known to man.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: How are we gonna stay in touch with one
another? Do we have walkie-talkies or something?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: No, we have these.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: All the money was spent on the guns and the
goggles.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Let’s get that bastard!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No, I won’t let you do it.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Alex, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him
from me? Well, over my dead body.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Let her go, Cin.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: But he’ll kill her!</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: That means more screen time for us.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Alright, let’s split up.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Every time some scary shit goes down and we
need to stick together, you white folks always say “Let’s split up.”</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: She’s right. We should stick together.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Alright. Come on, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Ain’t that some shit?</p>
<p><strong>int. secret study/foyer/living room/dining room –</strong>:
CONTINUOUS</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Huey, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Huey, Huey, baby, we have to talk!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Baby?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Come on, baby, we can work this out.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: If we just stick together no one can hurt us,
love!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I think we have to get a little therapy,
Hun.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Oh my god! Alex!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I think I’m dying, Theo… I just want you to
know, you’re the best friend I’ve ever had… Do you remember that time we
met?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And remember the time in the sixth grade, at
the dance? We wore the same dresses, but that didn’t stop us from having
the best time ever.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Um… we –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And remember that trip we took to Africa? That
safari was so wonderful. Me, you… best of friends… forever.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Uh, Alex, we’ve only know each other one
day.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh… I guess I’ll die now.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Okay… maybe that would be best.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, remember that time I got my training bra
and you –</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Never happened!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right… well, bye.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My favorite memory was when we –</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Would you die already?!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You check down here, I’ll check
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Ray! Brenda!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Ah! That’s what I’m talkin’ about. Fuck this
ghost hunting shit. I don’t know where to look for no ghost.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yo, son, why me? What you want with me?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Leave me alone. Stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Boo.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Where’s Shorty?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know. He was right behind us. Wait
here. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: THERE’S SOMETHING STRANGE IN YOUR HOOD…</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: WHO YOU GONNA CALL?</p>
<p><strong>shorty/ghost</strong>: GHOSTBUSTERS!!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Hey, shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: That was awesome.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: You try.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Where the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: It looks like the furnace.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Let’s get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Wait, I want to check something. Give me a
hand.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I found Hugh Kane’s wife’s diary. It said
Hanson the caretaker died in the furnace.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Well, if that’s Hanson, then who’s the guy
with the hand?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hugh Kane.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Let’s split up and meet at the other end.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit
this way? I hope she didn’t see me.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Good! I hope that shit kills her and just
leaves. God is looking out for me.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Lord, if I die, I’m going to fuck this bitch
up for getting me involved.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh my God! We’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: It would’ve just been you, if you would’ve
kept your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: It’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: What?! What is it, a monster?!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Aahhh! There it is!!!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Aw, shit girl. This what you’re running
from? He ain’t nothing but a skeleton. His skinny little ass can’t hurt
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: What?… this ain’t shit.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: It’s just a bunch of old bones. No muscle,
no strength. He hardly even weighs anything.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: What you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>skeleton head</strong>: Hey, give it back.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hey, look, I’m Wilma Flintstone.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hey, I have an idea…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Go on, get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You guys okay?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Yeah, it takes more than a bag of bones to
scare me.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do
something!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah, I think I’m bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Come on. There’s a first aid kit in the
lab.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cindy, I’ve been thinking about this whole
friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do… I
mean, there’s Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know,
bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there’s nights I
wake up screaming and I look over and Ray’s in my bed. Holding me. And
seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was
thinking…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That we should take our friendship a little
further?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It
might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full
advantage of it.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I was thinking the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: We should act out our inner most
fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Great!!!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Like, I’ve always wanted to walk on the
moon.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What about you, Buddy?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Well, I was hoping to get my balls
licked.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes, this is Doctor Peterson. I’m calling
for Dwight Hartman. He was storing some blood over there for me. It’s
for a little boy who’s in desperate need of a blood transfusion.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Dwight Hartman, no live here.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We gotta call for help.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hello? Do you read me? Come in… It’s useless.
They don’t work in here… must be the walls or something.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Come on you coward! Show yourself! Fight me
like a man.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Noooo!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Here. Take my hand.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Come on. Take it.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ahhhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: What are we gonna do? I’m cold. I can’t move,
I’m so cold.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Can you feel that?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No. Try a little higher.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Feel that?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No. Keep rubbing.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Better try a little higher.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Now, come on – you know I’m not ready for
that kind of –</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cindy, please! It’s a matter of life and
death. I’m asking you a friend.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Well… okay… but only as a friend.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You stay here. I’ve got to warn the
others.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Come in somebody. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This is Ray. What’s up? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy
is hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s your location? I repeat, what’s your
location?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Roger that we’re on our way over.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Where’s Shorty?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know. He was right behind me a minute
ago.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Ah, Cindy. Sit down, dear. Dinner’s almost
ready.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Oh, and the little weapon you’re hiding? Put
it on the table.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Come now, give it up.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Shorty, are you alright? Speak to me!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers?
You’ve drugged him!</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: No, actually, I found him like this. That’s
his stuff.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Sit down and join us, Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: She’d have to be really pretty and I’d have
to be very drunk.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I’m going to work in Washington, Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: That’s where my best customers are. Marion
Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I’d like to offer you a job, Cindy.
Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Now you’re being rude, Shorty.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Washington is full of cornpone country pussy
– just ask Jesse Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Alright! Everyone ready for the main
course?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Yo son, check this out.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Dog, you look hot.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hanson, please.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Don’t worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no
pain.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: It’s such a fascinating organ.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: This part here controls intelligence. Watch
what happens when I touch it.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Salutations, offspring. The fecal matter is
infirm. By the by, I do not wish to monopolize the conversation, but I
believe I’ve just figured out the cure for cancer. It’s really quite
simple –</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: And this part controls a person’s
manners.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Stop touching his brain!</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Um, I’m not touching anything.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Sorry, y’all. My bad.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Shorty, why don’t you say grace?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Me? Grace? Okay – Dear God –</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: This part removes the sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want
some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage…</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me
“Stop. If you loved me you’d stop.”</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Not in a thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Stop! –</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Made you say it!</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: It looks like I’ll have to give you
something to remember me by… This is really going to hurt.</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: I’ve been meaning to do this since my Bar
Mitzvah… Here.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Cindy, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: It’s Hanson, he’s evil. Let’s get him!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ouch… Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Dwight, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I can’t feel my legs.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You never could feel your legs.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: What do you know about it?!… Listen, the
ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine. I
need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Alright… I might need your help.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: My help?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: A little bit… Give me your belt.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not even wearing any drawers. Forget about
a belt.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Okay, give me my belt.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re not wearing a belt.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Alright, go to the belt store…</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Brenda!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The Crane style!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The Crouching Tiger style!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The Drunk Monkey!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The Mad Cow!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The Horny dog!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: The Camel Toe!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You gotta get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: There’s only one thing left to do. You guys,
go upstairs and get the machine ready!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Someone is going to have to lure him onto
the platform.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cindy, let me…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: No, Buddy, I’m the one he wants.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Actually, I was going to say let me have your
computer if you die.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on
the platform you gotta get out of there. Nobody wants to go.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Alright, let’s take a vote…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hugh Kane, it’s me you want, come get me! I’m
not afraid anymore! Show yourself!</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Prepare to die! Now you will be mine
forever!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cindy, get outta there. You’ll be killed. Do
something, Dwight!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I can’t, she’s still on the platform. If I
throw the switch she’ll die. Ahh! No!!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll get her.</p>
<p><strong>theo</strong>: Why is he running so slow?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Ray, run faster.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, I broke my fall.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Don’t fight it. Let it go. It’s time for you.
Rest time. Peace. Carolyn is waiting for you on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yes, go to her. You will be together with her
for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Goodbye, Hugh Kane.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Take care of yourself, Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: There you are, my love. I’ve been looking for
you. Now we can be together forever.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t you float away from me.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t you run from me!… I’m coming my
love!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We did it, you guys! We made it!</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Hey, y’all! What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Shorty! You’re alive!! But… what about your
head?</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: That turned out to be a good thing! It’s
gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I’m about
to get paid.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Come on, guys. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>father mcfeely</strong>: I’m afraid we’re too late.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: I found one in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>cop #3</strong>: There’s ass, blood and guts everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>mcfeely</strong>: My child, you’re alive!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yes, we made it!</p>
<p><strong>mcfeely</strong>: We? What do you mean… we?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Me and my friends… You see there was this
ghost. He came out of nowhere and….</p>
<p><strong>mcfeely</strong>: My child you are the only survivor.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: No, my friends are right here!</p>
<p><strong>mcfeely</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Father, I don’t understand. Tell me what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>mcfeely</strong>: Soon, but first I must bless this
house.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You mean to tell me we’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Noooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Now that we’re out of the house and back at
school, I know that everything’s going to be okay. I’m doubly lucky that
I made it out of the house with you…</p>
<p><strong>bird</strong>: Will you just shut up? Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hello? Oh hi Dad. Yeah, I’m so happy to be
back in college. I love my new roommate, but I have to say I was a
little nervous at first because she’s so religious.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Let Jesus fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: And I got the cutest little parrot. Birds are
such clean animals, he’s no trouble at all!</p>
<p><strong>bird</strong>: Uh, what do they put in this birdseed?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Sorry to bother you about this, Dad but I
need you to send me some more money. For some reason, the college
wouldn’t accept the cash you sent for my tuition.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Keep checking your mailbox, I’m sending you a
care package. Oh, and I’m putting in a little something for your bitch
Dwayne.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: There’s Buddy! Gotta go! Bye Dad!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Open chest!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Gotta be faster than that, thimble dick!</p>
<p><strong>regan</strong>: Fuck me! Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>bird</strong>: Girl, I wouldn’t fuck you if I was lying in
the desert dying of thirst, with buzzards all around, and your ass was a
water fountain.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yo’ Tommy, what up, man?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m totally freakin’ dude. I keep having
these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms.
I can’t take it anymore, man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on,
there’s this party tonight it’s gonna be fun. Lot’s of alcohol and
honeys.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Alright, but I ain’t drinking. and you’re
gonna have to look after me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t worry, I got your back.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: There’s something I really want to share with
you.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: There’s something I want to share with you
too. Here, smell this.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Cindy, about this whole friendship thing…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I know, but I’ve been thinking –</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I know, but I’ve been thinking –</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Listen to me I –</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Listen to me I –</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Look, what I’m trying to say –</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Look, what I’m trying to say –</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Stop it! I’m just trying to say I think we
should take our friendship to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t want to be your friend like this
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Then what are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You know, walking on the beach, holding
hands, kissing, making love…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That sounds kinda gay, but since you’re a
guy, I guess it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Let’s get a hot dog.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey, look out, a bee!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, Buddy, I’ve never had someone be so
protective of me!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: That’s what your man is supposed to do.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey, wanna’ share a soda?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh, Buddy, that’s so romantic.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah. Can I borrow five bucks?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What should we get?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I don’t care. You pick.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hot dogs.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Oh my God! Buddy, what are we going to
do?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: It was you…</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane
and his mistress.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Both of them?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Didn’t I just say that? Fucking listen.
Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I
worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for
you. Just like I did for Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: This can’t be happening?</p>
<p><strong>hanson</strong>: Now you’ll be mine, Cindy.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Noooo!!!</p>
