<p><strong>zito’s voice</strong>: Three times they cancel the order with
me, and three times they come back. Who they kidding? They cheap, cheap,
cheap. The other bread they get is no good. They save pennies. Everybody
complain and they come back. “Zito, your bread is the best.” They’re
like children stupid in school who cannot learn. The water. It’s the
water. You buy bread in Hoboken, you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water is
dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask your father. He knows.</p>
<p><strong>zito</strong>: You want me to make you some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What d’you know about coffee? Gimme a loaf
of bread.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: He looks great.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That Al Conti is a genius.</p>
<p><strong>conti’s voice</strong>: I am a genius.</p>
<p><strong>loretta’s voice</strong>: If you’re such an artistic genius,
why can’t you keep track of your receipts? How am I going to do your
income tax?</p>
<p><strong>conti’s voice</strong>: I am an artistic genius.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: If you’re an artistic genius, how come you
got butter on your tie?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Give it here. I’ll give you this, Al, you
make good coffee.</p>
<p><strong>florist’s voice</strong>: Red roses. Very romantic. The man
who sends these knows what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: The man who sends those spends a lot of
money on something that ends up in the garbage can.</p>
<p><strong>florist</strong>: I’m glad everybody ain’t like you, Loretta.
I’d be outta business.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Without me, you’d be out of business. I
like flowers.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Very good, Mr. Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: We will both have the Salad Ticino.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Uh-huh</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: And I’ll have the special fish.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You don’t want the fish.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s the oily fish tonight. Not before the
plane ride.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Maybe you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Yes, Miss Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That will give you a base. For your
stomach. You eat that oily fish, you go up in the air, halfway to Sicily
you’ll be green and your hands will be sweating.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: You look after me.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Patricia, please don’t go!</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: What do you think I am, a talking dog?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I was just making a point about the way you
said… the way you stated your aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You can kiss my aspirations!
Professor!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever. The
height of cleverness. Waiter!</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Could you do away with her dinner, and any
evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: But absolutely!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: A man who can’t control his woman is
funny.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: She was too young for him.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’samatter, Uncle Bobo?</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Tonight Mr. Johnny’s gonna propose
marriage.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How you know that?</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: He arranged it with me. When he asks her, then
he’ll wave to me and I’ll bring champagne. Good bachelor customer for
twenty years. But who knows? Maybe he’ll lose courage.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Heavy duty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Can I get another one of these?</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: Definitely!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: May I presume to ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Do you have a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: I am alone in the world.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: That’s very sad.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: How’s things?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Fine, Bobo. We’ll take the check.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: No, I want to see the dessert cart.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You never have dessert.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Never is a long time.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: My scalp is not getting enough blood
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Have Something.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Bobo, take the cart away.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Are you proposing marriage to me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You know I was married and that my husband
died. But what you don’t know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: We got married at the City Hall and I think
it gave bad luck the whole marriage.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Right from the start we didn’t do it right.
Could you kneel down?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: On the floor?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yes, on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: This is a good suit.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs
of pants. It’s for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman,
you should kneel down.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Is that man praying?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So. Will you ma…</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Where’s the ring?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: The ring?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A ring. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mook</strong>: I woulda sprung for a ring if it was me.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: She’s got him on his knees. He’s ruining his
suit.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You could use your pinky ring.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I like this ring.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You propose to a woman you should offer her
a ring of engagement.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On my
knees. In front of all these people. Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony Cammareri. I
will marry you. I will be your wife.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Bobo! The check!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I feel like I have just witnessed a car
accident.</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: When I was twenty-seven years old, in
Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled
a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: She didn’t hear me. She asked me to
repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn’t repeat it.
Outta shyness. So I’m a bachelor.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Seven-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: So we’ll pick up the car, we’ll make the
plane in plenty of time.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: My mother will be happy I’m getting
married.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: I forgot to bring the champagne,
Mr. Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I forgot to wave. We’ll have it at the
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What about the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: My mother is dying. When she is dead,
I’ll come back and we’ll be married.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How near is she to death?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: A week. Two weeks. No more.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Then let’s set the date.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How about a month from today?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Must it be so definite? Can’t we just
say that we will be married when I get back?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the
whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be
planned, a date must be set.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Alright. A month. In a month.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: A month from today?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’ll take care of it, Johnny. I’ll take
care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Oh, you’re not going. You’re staying.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: No, I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: The Shawfish?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The
men wanted to try to get home. I can’t explain.</p>
<p><strong>ava</strong>: Then, I suppose the time has come say it’s been
nice Dwight Lionel. It’s been everything. Oh, Dwight, I’m
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I
love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: International Flight Number Six-ohfour
boarding for Rome and Palermo at Gate Twenty-six.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Call me when you get in.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I’ll call you when I get to Mama’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’ve made me very happy, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: There’s one thing about this wedding I
want you to do. Call this number. It’s a business number. Ask for Ronny.
Invite him to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: He’s my younger brother.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You have a brother?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: We haven’t spoken in five years. There
was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the
wedding. Will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is the last call for International
Flight Number Six-ohfour boarding at Gate Twenty-six for Rome and
Palermo.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>crone</strong>: Do you have someone on that plane?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yeah. My fianc�.</p>
<p><strong>crone</strong>: I have put a curse on that plane. My sister
is on that plane. I have put a curse on that plane that it should
explode. Burn on fire and fall into the sea. Fifty years ago she stole a
man from me. Today she told me that she didn’t even love him. She took
him to feel strong with me. Now she goes back to Sicily. I have cursed
her that the green Atlantic water should swallow her up.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I don’t believe in curses.</p>
<p><strong>crone</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Mr. Johnny’s, right?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Right. The key’s in it.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Night.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I’ve seen how you look at her and it isn’t
right.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: How do I look at her? Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: A split of Moet.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: Like a wolf.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Like a wolf, huh? You never seen a wolf in your
life.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: That’s seven-fifty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: I seen a wolf in everybody I ever met and I
see a wolf in you.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: That makes ten. Thanks. Have a nice night.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: You know what I see in you, Lotte?</p>
<p><strong>lotte</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: The girl I married.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hello, boys and girls. Guess what happened
to me?</p>
<p><strong>old man’s voice</strong>: How long must I wait? Quanto tempo
devo aspettare?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Where’s Ma?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Bed.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’re not sleepy?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I can’t sleep anymore. It’s too much like
death.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Pop, I got news.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Alright. Let’s go in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Here. Ti amo.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Ti amo.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You look tired.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: What’s your news?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m getting married.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: You did this once it didn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: The guy died.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: What killed him?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He got hit by a bus.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married
fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and
somebody is dead. Don’t get married again, Loretta. It don’t work out
for you. Who’s the man?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Johnny Cammareri.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Him? He’s a big baby. Why isn’t he here with
you telling me?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He’s flying to Sicily. His mother’s
dying.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: More Bad Luck! I don’t like his face,
Loretta. I don’t like his lips. When he smiles I can’t see his teeth.
When will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: In a month.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I won’t come.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’ve got to come. You’ve got to give me
away.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I didn’t give you away the first time.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: And maybe that’s why I had the Bad Luck.
Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding
dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the
door, maybe then I wouldn’t had the Bad Luck I had.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I didn’t have no wedding cake, no reception
or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand
Ticino.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: That don’t sound like Johnny. Where’s the
ring?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: It looks stupid. It’s a pinky ring. It’s a
man’s ring.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s temporary.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Everything is temporary. That don’t excuse
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: So you’ll come to the wedding, right?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Let’s go tell your Mother.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Rose. Rose. Rose. Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Who’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Nobody. Loretta is getting married.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Again? Johnny Cammareri.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I don’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love
him, Loretta?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Good. When you love them they drive you crazy
cause they know they can. But you like him?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh yeah. He’s a sweet man. I wanna have a
big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And who’s gonna pay for that?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Pop.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Father of the bride pays.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I have no money!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re rich as Roosevelt. You’re just cheap,
Cosmo.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I won’t pay for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: He didn’t used to be cheap. He thinks if he
holds on to his money, he will never die.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s his duty as a father to pay for my
wedding, Ma …</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Now he’s gonna play that damn Vicki Carr
record. And then when he comes to bed, he won’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: It’s wrong to just let them go.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Good morning, Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: They run around, they mess up the whole
park.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What do you want me to do? Pick up after
five dogs? I’m eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands
that I cannot pick up after five dogs.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: You have too many dogs.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Lucy. There are big things going on in my
house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has
engaged herself to be married a second time.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on
his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri.
He says he is a big baby.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: You should have one dog. Like Lucy. Like me.
I wish I hadda gun. If I hadda gun, I would shoot four of your dogs.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Don’t fight.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: My granddaughter wants my son to pay for
the wedding. But he does not want to pay.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He should pay.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He owes her a wedding from the first time when
there was none.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Maybe. I don’t know. He has not asked my
advice. If he asks my advice, I don’t know what I will say.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: I won’t have to shoot those dogs. They will
kill each other.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love
each other.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Will you live here?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Pop don’t like Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: So we’ll sell the house.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I got married before, you didn’t sell.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home
going to school. Now he’s married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny
moved in, had a baby…</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m thirty-seven years old.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What’s thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was
thirty-seven. It ain’t over till it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Johnny has a big apartment. We’ll live
there.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And we’ll sell the house.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’d like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But
Pop don’t like Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. He don’t.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini -
yeah. Is that you Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Ssh, it’s me. I’m calling from the
deathbed of my mother.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How was your plane ride?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: The waitresses were very nice. My mother
is slipping away.</p>
<p><strong>vesta</strong>: Quanto tempo devo aspettare? How long must I
wait?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I can’t talk long.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Have you told her we’re getting
married?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Not yet. I’m waiting till a moment when
she’s peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>loretta’s voice</strong>: Just don’t wait until she’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Have you called my brother?</p>
<p><strong>loretta’s voice</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Will you do it today? Call him, make him
come to the wedding. Five years is too long for bad blood between
brothers. Nothing can replace your family. I see that now.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Alright. I’ll call him. Today. Listen,
Johnny. Call me after you tell your mother. Alright? Alright. And don’t
stand directly under the sun. You’ve got your hat, use your hat.
Alright. Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: How’s the mother?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: She’s dying. But I could still hear her big
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Did he tell her?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.
Where’s that card?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Who Are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Cammareri’s Bake Shop.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Is Ronny there?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Hold on. Ronny, the phone!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yeah, this is Ronny.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m calling for your brother Johnny. He’s
getting married and he wants you to come.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Why didn’t he call himself?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He’s in Palermo.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What’s wrong can never be made right.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Let me come and talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Is Ronny Cammareri here?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: He down at the ovens. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I would like to speak to him.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Hey, RONNY.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>chrissy’s voice</strong>: Somebody to see Ronny.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Ronny!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Somebody here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Have you come from my brother?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m going to marry him.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You are going to marry my brother?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yes. Do you want…</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I have no life.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I have no life. My brother Johnny took my
life from me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: And now he’s getting married. He has his,
he’s getting his. And he wants me to come? What is life?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I didn’t come here to upset you.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: They say bread is life. So I bake bread,
bread, bread. And the years go by! By! By! And I sweat and shovel this
stinking dough in and outta this hot hole in the wall and I should be so
happy, huh, sweetheart? You want me to come to the wedding of my brother
Johnny?!! Where is my wedding? Chrissy! Over by the wall! Gimme the big
knife!</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: No, Ronny!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Gimme the big knife! I’m gonna cut my
throat!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Maybe I should come back another time.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: No, I want you to see this! I want you to
watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day!
Chrissy, gimme the big knife!</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: I tell you I won’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Do you know about me?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Mr. Cammareri!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Nothing is anybody’s fault, but things
happen. Look.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: It’s wood. It’s fake. Five years ago I was
engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I
put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause
I wasn’t paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It’s funny
’cause - when my fianc� saw that I was maimed, she left me for another
man.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That’s the bad blood between you and
Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: But that wasn’t Johnny’s fault.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I don’t care! I ain’t no freakin monument to
justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny
has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my
heartbreak and forget?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Is it just a matter of time till a man opens
his eyes and gives up his one dream of happiness? Maybe. Maybe. All I
have… Have you come here, Stranger, Bride of my Brother, to take these
last few loaves from my table? Alright. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: This is the most tormented man I have ever
known. I am in love with this man. He doesn’t know that. I never told
him cause he can never love anybody since he lost his hand and his
girl.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Here. Why don’t you just kill him? It would
be so much more kind than coming here and inviting him to a wedding like
he’ll never have.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Where you live?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: And then there is copper, which is the only
pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves
money.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: And what did they say?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: The man understood me. The woman wanted to be
cheap, but the man saw that I was right.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You have such a head for knowing. You know
everything.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: It’s a present.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Oh, Cosmo!</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to
the stars, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You ready for the coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Loretta. What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m making you a steak.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You don’t have to help me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I know that. I do what I want.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I like it well done.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’ll eat this bloody to feed your
blood.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: This is good. Uhh…</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Where’d Johnny find you?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He knew my husband who died.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: How’d he die?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Bus hit him.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Fast.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Instantaneous.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: When you get engaged?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Why what?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: So. Five years ago your hand got cut off
and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: When your husband get hit by the bus?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Seven years ago.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: How many men since then?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Just Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Stupid yourself.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I don’t care about Luck, you understand me?
It ain’t that.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What? Do you think you’re the only one ever
shed a tear?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Why you talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You got any whiskey? How ’bout giving me a
glass of whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: She was right to leave me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You really are stupid, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You don’t know nothing about it.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I was raised that a girl gets married
young. I didn’t get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I
loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said
no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not
know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn’t know… You tell me a
story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true
story is, and you can’t. She didn’t leave you! You can’t see what you
are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’m a wolf?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: The big part of you has no words and it’s-a
wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not
get away. So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay
to be free. Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to
do, between you and you, and I know I’m right, I don’t care what you
say. And now you’re afraid because you found out the big part of you is
a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from
the trap of the wrong love. That’s why there has been no woman since
that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you
make that mistake again!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m telling you your life!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Why are you marrying Johnny? He’s a fool!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Because I have no Luck!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: He made me look the wrong way and I cut off
my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your
whole head!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I am looking where I should to become a
bride!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: A bride without a head!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: A wolf without a foot!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: It’s like I’m falling! It’s like I’m in the
ocean!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I have no Luck!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: To the bed.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh. Oh God. I don’t care about anything. I
don’t care about anything! Take me to the bed.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: “O SOAVE FANCIULLA”, from “La Boheme.” The
MUSIC</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I can’t believe what is happening.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I was dead.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I was dead, too.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Your blood.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: All my life I have never reached a man. I
knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead.
Ronny.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I want to cut you open and crawl inside of
you. I want you to swallow me.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Get all of me. Take everything.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What about Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’re mad at him, take it out on me, take
your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry!
Hollow me out so there’s nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck
me dry!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Alright. Alright. There will be nothing
left.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Where’s Loretta? We’re gonna start without
her.</p>
<p><strong>rose’s voice</strong>: She must be eating out.</p>
<p><strong>raymond’s voice</strong>: She don’t know what she’s
missing.</p>
<p><strong>rose’s voice</strong>: It’s not like her not to call.</p>
<p><strong>rita’s voice</strong>: Well, she’s got a lot on her mind.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I mean, can we talk about it, Rose?
Everybody’s heard. She’s getting married again.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Johnny Cammareri. I think it’s great and
about time. What’s she gonna do with the rest of her life she don’t get
married?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: My father needs a plate.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me
you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was
marrying Rita, she was happy.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Marriage is happy news.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Rose, pass the wine.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo
back then! He’d stand outside the house all day and look in the windows.
I never told you this cause it’s not really a story. But one time I woke
up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face.
Like a flashlight. I couldn’t think a what it was. I looked out the
window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so
big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the
house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo,
looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you,
Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you
were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and
didn’t know no better.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: You were altogether asleep. You were
dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No. You were there.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Well, what do you wanna talk about!</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Rita. Pass the wine.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Why you drinking so much?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Old Man, if you give another piece of my food
to those dogs, I’m gonna kick you till you’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cosmo?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You drank too much and now you sleep too hard,
and later you’ll be up when you should be down.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That light.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I don’t know. I think it’s the moon.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: It’s so bright.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’ve never seen a moon like that.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: It makes you look like an angel.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yeah. Looks like a big snowball.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Rita. Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s Cosmo’s moon.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo
can’t own the moon.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I mean it’s that moon I was talking about
at dinner. Is he down there? No.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is who down there?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Cosmo.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What would he be doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You know, in this light, and with that
expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Alright now. Howl. Howl.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: How long must I wait? Quanto tempo devo
aspettare!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What? What have we done?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: This time I was trying to do everything
right.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: pulls it on, puts it on and moves towards</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I thought if I stayed away from the City
Hall, I won’t have that Bad Luck I had again.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You’re trying to make me feel guilty.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m marrying your brother!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: All right, I’m guilty. I confess!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’re invited to the wedding! It’s in a
few weeks. Why didn’t you do like him and be with your dying mother in
Palermo?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: She didn’t like me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You don’t get along with anybody!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You ruined my life.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That’s impossible! It was ruint when I got
here! You ruint my life!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Oh no I didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh yes, oh yes you did! You’ve got those
bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn’t I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that
all I’m ever gonna have? Why didn’t I just pick up a stone and kill
myself years and years ago? I’m gonna marry him!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Last night never happened, you hear me? I’m
gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are
gonna take this to our coffins!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’m in love with you!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Snap out of it!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Alright. Then I must never see you again.
The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all
time. You won’t come to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’ll come to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m telling you you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: But he wants me to come!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: But that’s cause he don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Alright. I will not come. Provided one
thing.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: That you come with me tonight. Once. To the
Opera.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I love two things. I love you, and I love the
Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night,
I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Alright. Meet me at the Met.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Alright. Where’s the Met?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It’s
been two months since my last confession.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What sins have you to confess?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Twice I took the name of God in vain, once
I slept with the brother of my fianc�, and once I bounced a check at the
liquor store – but that was really an accident.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Then it was not a sin. But what was that
second thing you said, Loretta?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I… a… slept with my fianc�’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: That’s a pretty big sin.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You should think about this.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Alright. This is your penance. Say two
rosaries and… be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I absolve you in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Just like your father. I lied to him. He
thinks you came home last night.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Thanks. What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cosmo’s cheating on me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What! How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: A wife knows.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Then you don’t know. You’re just imagining
it. He’s too old.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I won’t be home for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: See you tomorrow, Chrissy.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Okay, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The cake!</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Where’s Ronny? How come he ain’t come
down?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: Hello, Cammareri’s? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: That was Ronny. He don’t feel good. He
ain’t gonna be down today.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What, is he still upset?</p>
<p><strong>chrissy</strong>: It’s that bitch!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like
Orlando Furioso!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: cautiously, then</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Shut up. They’ll hear you in the back.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: So what? The pleasure of marriage is you
sleep with the woman and then you don’t worry about nothing. Hey, how
about a date tonight, Rita. Let’s eat pasta and roll around.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What’s got
into you?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t know! That moon! That crazy moon
Cosmo sent over!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Hey there</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What’s the matter with him?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You got me.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You see that moon last night?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What about the moon?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Listen, I gotta go. I’ll take the deposit
to the bank but I’ll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You gotta date?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What are you talking about, you fool? Her
fianc�’s in Palermo.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I got things to do.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Sure you do. You got all that wedding
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Well, that’s romantic, too.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: HEY. Make me a bowl of minestrone.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: What’s the matter? You look crazy.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.</p>
<p><strong>old man’s voice</strong>: I’ve got a lot on my mind. Things
are getting bad in my house. My daughter-in-law is mad at my son because
he will not pay for the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to
kill me. Things are very bad in my house.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Don’t fight.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will
split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: We’re supposed to do fifty apples. We only
got twelve done.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I don’t know what to advise my son. I think
he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don’t look
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Don’t make yourself sick.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I will. But I must find the right
moment.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Did you see the moon last night?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Bye, Aunt Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yeah, I’ll be in.</p>
<p><strong>bonnie</strong>: So? You want the usual?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I want you to get rid of the grey.</p>
<p><strong>transformational music starts here and continues through
the</strong>: FOLLOWING SCENES. This music should convey that Loretta is
turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful coach. Bonnie
wakes up upon hearing this startling news and gets very excited.</p>
<p><strong>bonnie</strong>: I’ve been wanting to do this for three
years! Let me show you some magazines! You’ve got to get a manicure! And
your eyebrows! Sheila! I’m gonna need help!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You look beautiful. Your hair…</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I thought I’d try it. You look good.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I said I’d go to the opera with you.
Nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Who painted that?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Marc Chagall. A Russian.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Kinda gaudy.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: He was having some fun. Yeah, well he’s dead.
Come on, let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I don’t know. For your hair. For your
beautiful dress. For… you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love
the Opera. You know it’s been a long time since I’ve been to the
Opera.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: So. Where are we sitting?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who’s coming?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s just me. I want to eat.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I got a table for you right now.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This alright?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Enjoy your meal.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You eating alone
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a martini, no
ice and two olives.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>sheila’s voice</strong>: I’m trying to explain to you how I
feel. Every time I try to explain how I feel, you explain how you feel.
I don’t think that’s really much of a response.</p>
<p><strong>unseen man’s voice</strong>: Well, its the only response I’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You wanna see a menu?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Not yet. I’ll wave.</p>
<p><strong>sheila’s voice</strong>: I really do hate it though, when you
take that tone with me. Like you’re above it all and isn’t it
amusing.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: But it is, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sheila’s voice</strong>: Not to me! This is my life, no
matter how damned comical it may seem to you. I don’t need some man
standing above the struggle while I roll around in the mud!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I think you like the mud and I don’t.
That’s fair, isn’t it? If I don’t care to…</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Sorry about that, folks. She’s a very pretty
mental patient.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Don’t mind about me. But could you do me a
favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring
me a big glass of vodka?</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: Absolutely!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m sorry if we disturbed you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m not disturbed. By you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: My lady friend has a personality
disorder.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: She was just too young for you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Thanks, comrade.</p>
<p><strong>shy waiter</strong>: It’s nothing!</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know
how to hurt guy. How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Sorry. That was rude.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Will you join me for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Then I’d be delighted. I hate eating alone,
and it’s amazing how often I end up doing just that.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m a professor. I teach communications at
N.Y.U.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That woman was a student of yours?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: There’s old saying my mother told me. Would
you like to hear it?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Don’t shit where you eat.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’ll remember that. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m a housewife.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Then why are you eating alone?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m not eating alone. Can I ask you a
question?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Why do men chase women?</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Nerves.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I think it’s because they fear death.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase
women? I find women charming.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I teach these classes I’ve taught for a
million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I
started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now
it’s rote, it’s the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes
I’m droning along and I look up, and there’s this fresh young beautiful
face, and it’s all new to her and I’m this great guy who’s just
brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out
among those chairs and look at a young woman’s face, and see me there in
her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I
ask her out on a date. It doesn’t last. It can go for a few weeks or a
couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I’m just a burnt
out old gasbag and that she’s as fresh and bright and full of promise as
moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a
glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What you don’t know about women is a lot.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: They get some turnout for this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: It’s the best thing there is.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I like parts of it, but I don’t really get
it.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You haven’t once said you like my dress.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I like your dress. It’s very bright.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Why you looking around so much?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I don’t know. I got a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: I’m wearing your bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: May I walk with you a ways?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: You knew that man?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That was just so… awful!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Awful?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Beautiful. Sad. She died!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I couldn’t believe it! I didn’t think she
was going to die. I knew she was sick…</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: She had TB.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I know. She was coughing her brains out.
And still, she had to sing all the time…</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Pop?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Wait for me by the doors, Mona.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Pop? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Mona?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: What’d you do to your hair?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I got it done.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Who is this man? You’re engaged!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’re married.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: You’re my daughter. I won’t have you acting
like a tramp!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’re my father.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Alright. I didn’t see you here.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I don’t know whether I saw you or not.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Let’s get outta here. I’ll buy you a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That wasn’t my mother.</p>
<p><strong>rose’s voice</strong>: That’s my house.</p>
<p><strong>perry’s voice</strong>: You mean the whole house?</p>
<p><strong>rose’s voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>perry’s voice</strong>: My God, it’s a mansion!</p>
<p><strong>rose’s voice</strong>: It’s a house.</p>
<p><strong>perry’s voice</strong>: I live in a one-bedroom apartment.
What exactly does your husband do?</p>
<p><strong>rose’s voice</strong>: He’s a plumber.</p>
<p><strong>perry’s voice</strong>: Well. That explains it.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Temperature’s dropping.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I guess you can’t invite me in?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: People home.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. I think the house is empty. I can’t invite
you in because I’m married and because I know who I am. You’re
shaking.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m a little cold.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re a little boy and you like to be
bad.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: We could go to my apartment. You could see
how the other half lives.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m too old for you.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m too old for me. That’s my
predicament.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek,
too?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: I’m freezing</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Another Old-Fashion?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Loretta?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I think that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What do you want to do now?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I wanna go home.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s really cold.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yeah. It smells like snow.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: My mother guessed that my father was seeing
somebody and I told her she was crazy. She looked like a real piece of
cheap goods. But who am I to talk?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How can you ask me that?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You’re making me feel guilty again.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You are guilty. I’m guilty.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Of what? Only God can point the finger,
Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I know what I know.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: And what do you know? You tell me my life?
I’ll tell you yours. I’m a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don’t
make you no lamb! You’re gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your
life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a
woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time,
why didn’t you wait for the right man again?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He didn’t come!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’m here!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’re late!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: This is your place.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: This is where we’re going!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: The deal was if I came to the Opera with
you you’d leave me alone forever.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I went with you. Now I’m gonna marry Johnny
and you’re gonna leave me alone. Right? A person can see where they’ve
messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and
they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I
don’t haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some
things and no to something that’s just gonna ruin everything! I can do
that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?
Ronny? Are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m really afraid.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m afraid of who I am.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: And you’re not now?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I don’t know. Everything seems like nothing
now against that I want you in my bed. I don’t care if I burn in hell. I
don’t care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now.
I see that they’re nothing, I see they ain’t here. The only thing that’s
here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take
everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t take
everything in a hundred years. It’s the way we are. We compound each
other.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Let me go home.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Let me go home.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m freezing to death.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Come upstairs. I don’t care why you come. No,
that’s not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love
is and I didn’t know this either. But love don’t make things nice, it
ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We’re
not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are
perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and
love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come
upstairs with me, baby! Don’t try to live your life out to somebody
else’s idea of sweet happiness. Don’t try to live on milk and cookies
when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It’s wolves run with
wolves and nothing else! You’re a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with
me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: 19 Cranberry Street.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Hello. I’m sorry to call so late…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Moving in?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I came right from the airport.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk
to her.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: She’s not home yet. Take off your coat and
come in the living room. I’ll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Out. I don’t know where. I was waiting up for
my husband.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: It’s late.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Maybe I should go?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What are you doing here? You’re supposed to be
in Palermo.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: That’s what I came to tell Loretta.
There’s been a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: A miracle. Well, that’s news.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: My mother’s recovered.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: The breath had almost totally left her
body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from
death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone
in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that
would choke a pig!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That’s incredible.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Hello Pop.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong
idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there’s a question I want to ask you.
And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase
women?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Well. There’s the Bible story. God took
a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back.
When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to
be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn’t complete as a
man without a woman.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: But why would a man need more than one
woman?</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe because he fears
death.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That’s it! That’s the reason!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No, that’s really it. Thank you for answering
my question.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Hi. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Hello, Mr. Castorini.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I don’t know, Rose. I don’t know where I’ve
been, and I don’t know where I’m going. You should have your eyes opened
for you, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I have my eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: You do, huh? Stick around. Don’t go on any
long trips.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I know you don’t. That’s the point. I’ll say
no more.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: You haven’t said anything.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: And that’s how much I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cosmo?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I just want you to know. No matter what you
do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Thank you, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: I’m going to bed now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo’s voice</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: He doesn’t like you. Thank you for answering
my question.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: You don’t know where Loretta is?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Then tell her I’ll come by in the
morning. We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Okay, I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Well. I don’t really know where to
start.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Your hair’s different.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Everything’s different.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No. Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. But I have a hangover.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Where’s pop?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last
night.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What? He’s in Sicily!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No more he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He’s with his dying mother!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: She recovered.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: WHAT!! She was dying!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It was a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: A miracle? This is modern times! There
ain’t supposed to be miracles any more!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I guess it ain’t modern times in Sicily. He
came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love
bite on your neck. He’s coming back this morning.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s not Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Ronny!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Is Johnny here?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Good! We can get this out on the table. I’m
Ronny, Johnny’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Nice to meet you. You’ve got a love bite on
your neck. Your mother’s recovered from death.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Oh. Good. We’re not close. I’m not really
moved.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You’ve gotta get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: No. I’m gonna wait.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Ronny, please…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Would anyone like some oatmeal?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yes, I would like some oatmeal.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: His brother.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: You’re Johnny’s brother?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I am old. The Old are not wanted. And what
they say has no weight. But, my son, I must speak. You should pay for
the wedding of your only daughter. You are breaking your house through
pride. There. I’ve said it.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: It’s okay, Pop. If she gets married, I’ll pay
for the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Have I been a good wife?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I want you to stop seeing her.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And go to confession.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: A man… under stands one day… that his life is
built on nothing. And that’s a bad, crazy day.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Ti amo.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s Johnny. I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: No, I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No, I’ll tell him. What am I going to tell
him?</p>
<p><strong>cosmo</strong>: Tell him the truth, Loretta they find out
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I love you Pop.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Hi Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Hi, Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hi. Why ain’t you at the store?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Is there anything you want to tell us,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You? No.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We just come from the bank.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: She’s got it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I knew she had it.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: We didn’t know what to think. You were so
weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no
bag.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Listen. Who wants coffee?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: So what are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We’re waiting for Johnny Cammareri.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’m his brother.</p>
<p><strong>ta</strong>: Nice to meet you. I’m Rita Cappomaggi.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m Raymond Cappomaggi. I’m Rose’s
brother.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Somebody tell a joke!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m getting palpitations!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I thought he was in Palermo.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s Johnny Cammareri.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Loretta…</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Ronny! Our mother has recovered from
death!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Have you come to make peace with me?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Well. Yeah. You may not want to.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Of course I want to.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I don’t know. But Johnny, how did your
mother recover? She was dying.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: We should talk alone.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I can’t. I need my family around me
now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Well. I told my mother that we were to
be married. And she got well. Right away.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: I’m sure she did.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: It was a miracle!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Johnny, I have something to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I have something to tell you. But I must
talk to you alone.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I have no secrets from my family.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Loretta, I can’t marry you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: If I marry you my mother will die.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What the hell are you talking about? We’re
engaged.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Loretta, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m talking about a promise. You proposed
to me!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: Because my mother was dying! But now
she’s not.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: You’re forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama
is still running your life.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: And you are a son who doesn’t love his
mother!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: And you’re a big liar! I’ve got your ring
here!</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: I must ask for that back.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Here! Take your stupid pinky ring. Who
needs it? The engagement’s off.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: In time, you will see that this is the
best thing.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: In time, you will drop dead, and I will
come to your funeral in a red dress.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Loretta?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Will you marry me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. johnny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Where’s the ring?</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Could I a… borrow that ring.</p>
<p><strong>ronny</strong>: Thanks.</p>
