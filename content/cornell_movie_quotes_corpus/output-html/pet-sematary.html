<h1 id="pet-sematary">pet-sematary</h1>
<p><strong>biffer biffer a helluva sniffer until he died he made us
richer</strong>: 1971-1974.</p>
<p><strong>the camera holds on this for a moment or two, then pans
slowly</strong>: DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are
looking across to a deadfall–a tangle of weather-whitened old dead
branches at the back of the graveyard. It’s maybe twenty-five feet from
side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are thick tangles
of underbrush that look impassible.</p>
<p><strong>growing sound</strong>: the rumble of a truck. A big, big
truck. It belts between the CAMERA and the house – a tanker truck with a
silver body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its
short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it comes a
Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the driveway of the
house we’ve been looking at.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: So…what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s gorgeous!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Am I really gonna have my own room?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yaay!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes, but the rope might be–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yaay!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Let her go. It’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Louis, the house is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The Master of Disaster awakes.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And Buckaroo Banzai.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Come on–let’s parole ’em.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Decided to wake up and see what home looks
like, huh?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ellie, you heard your m—</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Wh–</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire
swing–with ELLIE still inside it–goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE
screams and begins to cry–a little hurt and a lot surprised.</p>
<p><strong>louis rachel</strong>: Ellie! Are you all right? Honey? Are
you okay?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hurrts! It hurrrrts!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Anyone who can scream that loud isn’t ready
for intensive care just yet– looks like she just skinned her knee.</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Hi-Durch!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Waow!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a
big one.</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Druck!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Gage’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jesus, the road!</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Drucks!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Gage!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes–thanks. I’m Louis Creed.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m Rachel. Thanks again for saving the
wandering minstrel boy, here.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for
that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the
night.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Who might you be, little Miss?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane,
Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your
dad’s gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think
you’re going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Crandall–I’ve got to change
this kid. It’s nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Same here. Come over and visit when you get the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No-I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yayyy!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: House has stood empty for too long. It’s damn
good to see people in it again.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A truck engine, gearing down.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hey–they actually found the place!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Movin’ in’s mighty thirsty work. I usually sit
out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m’dinner.
Come on over and join me, if you want.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, maybe I—-</p>
<p><strong>first mover</strong>: You Mr. Creed?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes. Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The movers–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes–I know. This path, Louis? Where does it
go?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I don’t have the slightest idea. When I saw
the house, this field was under four feet of snow.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Oh, ayuh! I know. It’s a good story, and a good
walk, too. I’ll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too–
after you get settled in.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Crickets. Ree–ree–ree-ree…</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the
far side of the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re not really going over to have a beer
with that old guy, are you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, I’ve got a million questions about the
area, and—</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: —and you’ll end up doing a free consultation
on his arthritis or urinary problems and—</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Did you see his shirt?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I really do have a million questions about
the area…but the thing I’m really curious about is how come this
octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with
the Boss.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Well, come on up and have a beer.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You need a glass?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: God, that’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ain’t it just? The man who invented beer,
Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What were you listening to?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Allman Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good
before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Ramblin’ Man blasts us out of our seats.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I’m sorry. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Try that.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I like rock and roll. No…I guess that’s too
mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it’s the only
music I can really hear. And since my wife died…I dunno, some- times a
little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. One more
time–welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The one that goes into the woods–sure.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: That road–and those Orinco trucks– are the two
main reasons it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What’s at the end of it?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And yours.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Church! God, you scared the life out of
me!</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Waow!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Take a look behind you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My God!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You folks ready to go on?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You’ll see soon enough, hon.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper
companies?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Nope. The Micmac Indians. What’s up ahead is
all that’s left of their tribal lands.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Not yet…how much further is it?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Aw, you’ll be okay. Less than a mile.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’s it say, mommy?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It’s misspelled,
but…that’s what it says.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Ellen–!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I told you it was a bad road, Louis–it’s killed
a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy. But at least something
good come of it. This place.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How can you call it a good thing? A
graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken-
hearted children!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Well, but Missus Creed! It ain’t quite that
way, deah!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I think it’s rather extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Well…they have to learn about death somehow,
now don’t they, Missus Creed? The little ones?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Well…well, because–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s okay, Mr. Crandall–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, I thought it was safe–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like
this, Ellie–sometimes they bite.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Bite?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I want to look around, daddy– may I?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: For a little while.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can hardly read these.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh–they get older as you go toward the
middle. Pete LaVasseur’s dog is buried there… the Stoppard boys’ racing
pigeon that Missus Cowley’s cat got…and I think that’s the cat himself
right there, although it’s been so many years I can’t tell for sure.
Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I see you’re quite a reader for such a little
girl. Can you read that?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: “Spot a good fellow we love you boy.” “Owned
by Judson…Judson…” Gee, I can’t read the rest.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Last name’s Crandall, little missy.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: That’s where I buried my dog Spot when he died
of old age in 19 and 14. Dug it good and deep. By the time I finished, I
had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back. Soil’s
stony up here.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I
know you know it’s a boneyard, but a bone ain’t nothing and even a whole
pile of ’em don’t amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really
is?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well…I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: It’s a place where the dead speak, Missy.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No–not right out loud. Their stones speak…or
their markers. Even if the marker ain’t nothing but a tin can someone
wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain’t that so, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I think it is so, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What if you can’t read what’s written on
there anymore?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Well, it still says some animal got laid down
here after, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And that someone cared enough about that
animal to mark the spot.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: To remember.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Mommy! This is a place where dead animals
talk! Mr. Crandall said so!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any
kind. As you may have noticed.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Me neither. But I believe in knowing your
enemy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there because of
the road, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge
tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn’t cross the road so much.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, it’s always better to take
precautions–but I’m sure Church will be all right, honey…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: In the end he’s gonna croak, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lovey…Church might be still alive when you’re
in a high school…and that’s a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It doesn’t seem long to me. It seems short. I
think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: If it was up to me I’d let Church live to be
a hundred…but I don’t make up the rules.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She’s finally asleep.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She was a little over-excited, that’s all.
Poor kid.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It was that place. That creepy cemetery up
in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don’t
want Ellie to catch it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jesus, Rachel, what’s got into you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Do you think I didn’t hear her tonight,
crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going
to die.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Rachel…someday Church is going to die.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Rachel–!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yee-uck! Gross!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He can’t help it, babe. Emily Post is going
to be beyond him for a few years.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t want him to get his nuts cut, daddy!
What if he dies?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Good God! Where’d you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Missy Dandridge. And she says it’s a
operation!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Honey, Church will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet
Sematary?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t be silly. Church is not going to
die.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: According to what Mr. Crandall says, the
road’s a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the
same. Well–almost the same–and we won’t have to worry about him getting
turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s enough of that kind of talk!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I just said–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your
place.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’ll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be
excused. Go and wash your face.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And Church will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, honey…you know that…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little
girl her promise.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yayyyy!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh, you’re welcome. Only if some- thing
should go wrong while he’s under the gas–it’s a one-in-a-thousand shot,
but it happens–you explain to her.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Have a great day!</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Bye-bye!</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: Gonna get his–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: –nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy, for
introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter’s vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You ought to see a doctor about it.</p>
<p><strong>missy</strong>: It’ll pass. They always do.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank God. I was a little worried there.
Have a great first day at school, doc. No broken bones.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: Holy Jesus. Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed!
Dr. Creed, we’ve got a mess here! Stat!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Steve, get the ambulance over here right now.
He’s got to go to EMMC.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: The ambulance is at Sonny’s Sunoco downtown,
getting–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: –a new muffler, oh shit–</p>
<p><strong>candystriper</strong>: I can’t look at it…I can’t stand
it…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Help me hold him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It wouldn’t matter if we did have the
ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It wouldn’t matter if we had the SST.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He’s going. Steve, go call the motor- pool.
Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.</p>
<p><strong>charlton</strong>: It won’t–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I know it won’t! But let’s for God’s sake do
it by the rules!</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: There wasn’t even supposed to be a sprain
today, my friend–that’s what I told her.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: …Pet Sematary…</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: It’s not the real cemetery… The soil of a
man’s heart is stonier, Louis…a man grows what he can…and tends it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Louis, they’re sending a–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Steve, will you get a sheet to cover him
with?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He said my name. I heard it. He said my
name.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Loud, hollow BANG. It’s very loud–loud enough
to wake the dead.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Come on, doc. We got places to go.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Come on, doc–don’t make me tell you
twice.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Let’s go, doc.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Who said you were dreaming?</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: This is the place where the dead speak.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that’s
all. I–</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: The door must not be opened. The barrier
must not be crossed. Don’t go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you
have to. There’s more power here than you know.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone.
It’s not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought
you in–</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: The power of this place is old and always
restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Remember.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Getting there.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I got eggs down here!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Good d–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to
Chicago for a few days?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: For Ellie’s birthday, yes. I didn’t go
because her old man thinks I’m a shit and the feeling is heartily re-
ciprocated…they’ll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Well, there’s a dead cat over here on the edge
of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter’s.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s Church.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I’m sorry. At least it don’t look like he
suffered.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ellie will, though. She’ll suffer plenty.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Loved that cat pretty well, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Bagged cat. What a mess.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Going to tell Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Seems like you told me about a promise you
made–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Cat’s just as dead, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No need to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Maybe when they call I’ll just tell Ellie I
haven’t seen the damn cat around. You know?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jud, this is crazy. It’s going to be almost
dark before we get back.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: It’s going to be dark before we even get where
we’re going, Louis. But we can do it…and we’re going to.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Does she love the cat?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes, but–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Then come on.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed
Dreamland.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: What say, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle
or start a new one?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: We’re still not where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: The place we’re going is on the other side of
that.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We can’t climb over that. We’ll break our
necks!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No. We won’t. I have climbed it a time or two
before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me…move
easy…don’t look down…and don’t stop. If you stop, you’ll crash through
for sure.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m not climbing that.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Give me the cat. I’ll take care of it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: God, this is amazing!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Just don’t stop and–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And don’t look down. Right.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Louis! You all right?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No, you shouldn’t have stopped. But you got
away with it. Important thing is are you sure you’re all right?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes. Where are we going, Jud?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You’ll see before long. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: This next bit’s like the deadfall, Louis– you
got to walk steady and easy. Just follow me and don’t look down.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Is there quicksand?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: There’s a lot of funny things down this way,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You’re telling me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s funny, all right.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Just don’t stop, Louis. You don’t ever want to
stop down here in Little God. And you don’t ever want to look behind
you, whatever you hear.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Almost there, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You keep saying that.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: This time I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The wind, blowing ceaselessly.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: This was their burying ground, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Whose burying ground?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury
Ellen’s cat.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why? For God’s sake, why?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I had my reasons, Louis. We’ll talk later. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I guess so…but…</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You want to rest a bit before you start?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No, I’m okay. Will I really be able to dig
him a grave? The soil looks thin.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Soil’s thin, all right. But you’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I’m going to sit over yonder and have a smoke.
I’d help you, but you’ve got to do it yourself. Each buries his own.
That’s how it was done then.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What are those for?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Your cairn.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Doesn’t look like they last long.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Don’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jud, why am I doing all this?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Because it’s right.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a
hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but
you were a hell of a good cat.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: That’s fine. You did real good.</p>
<p><strong>sound, faint</strong>: The telephone.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh, shit! Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: When you talk to ’em, not one word about what
we done tonight. ’S’far’s you know, the cat’s still fine.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You’ll understand. In the meantime, keep your
peace. What we did, Louis, was a secret thing. Women are supposed to be
the ones who are good at keeping secrets, but any woman who knows
anything at all would tell you she’s never seen into a man’s heart. The
soil of a man’s heart is stonier, Louis–like the soil up there in the
old Micmac burying ground. A man grows what he can…and tends it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No buts! Accept what’s done, Louis. What we
done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was… at
least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call…but not a word
about tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sounds</strong>: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone.
Ringing. Then:</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hi, Dory…it’s Louis–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’d be real fine.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yeah, I know…how are things out there in
Chicagoland?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Fine…except when Mom was airing Gage’s diaper
rash, he walked away and got into Grampa’s study and pooped in Grampa’s
favorite chair.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I said that’s too bad. What did you get for
presents from Gramma and Grampa?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: …and a Garfield radio! How’s Church, dad?
Does he miss me?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well…I guess he’s just fine, Ellie. I haven’t
seen him this evening, but–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, make sure you put him down cellar
before you go to bed so he can’t run out in the road and get greased.
And kiss him goodnight for me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Want to talk to Gage?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Food, Church…food!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Miaow.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Come on, Church! Chow down!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: In a second.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded Christ,
he ch–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What did we do?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I most generally don’t start before noon, but
this looks like an exception.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What did we do, Jud?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Why, saved a little girl from being
unhappy…that’s all. Drink up, Louis!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I tried to tell myself I buried him alive.
You know–Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But…</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Wouldn’t wash?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No. I’m a doctor. I know death when I see it,
and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he’s
alive…and I feel like I’m going crazy. It was that place, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the
place–Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half
Micmac himself.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Can I have another one?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I guess it wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: The Micmacs used to bury their dead up there
long before the whites came.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: They buried their dead and for a long time
their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died
in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Wendigo?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit.
Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And
if one touches you…</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Maybe it really was a Wendigo– I ain’t the one
to say it wasn’t– or maybe it was just some disease. Whatever the
reason, those that were left moved on. But they left that place…the way
it is now.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You and this old Indian rag-man–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last
night, Louis. Only I wasn’t alone when Spot came back.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How did your mother take it, Jud? How did she
take it when your dog came back from the dead?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Well, she was a little upset at first, and
that’s why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to
your people last night…you did, didn’t you, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Why, then, things should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: A little upset is all she was? Because I’ll
tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the
edge of a meltdown.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: She got used to the idea. Spot lived another
four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I
buried him in the Pet Sematary…where his bones still lie.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: A man doesn’t always know why he does things,
Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain’t ready for her
favorite pet to die.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ellie’s a little scared of death. And the main
reason Ellie’s that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death.
Now you just go ahead and tell me I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little
girl her promise.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: The door must not be opened. The barrier
must not be crossed.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You don’t understand–</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Sometimes the dead do more than speak.
Remember, doc.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Promise…</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A splash. Something has been dropped into the
bath.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How the hell did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hi, sugar!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Daddy, is Church all right?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes…I guess so. He was sleeping on the front
porch when I left.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed
he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet
Sematary.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Is he really all right?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Because you promised.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Want to take your son, doc?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes–you have to take them to someone who
grooms animals, though. I think it’s pretty expensive.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ve noticed it, too. I’ll cough up the
money, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I hate that smell.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes–I hate it, too.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A pen scratching over paper.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Descending footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Ree-ree-ree…then…</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Kick! THUMP!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Ree-ree-ree…</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Car engines starting up.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: They’re all turning on their lights! Daddy,
why are they all turning on their lights in the middle of the day?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Is that right, dad?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes. To honor the dead.</p>
<p>**[note**: In the book LOUIS finds it difficult to enter at night
because of a high iron fence. Here we should see there’s no such
problem; there’s only a low stone wall between the graveyard and the
public road.]</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Rachel not feeling well?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well…a touch of the flu…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: She’s in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since
Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’s enough, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: This babe has said enough.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hop in, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I
remember when she was no older’n Ellen there, walking down to the store
with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin’ behind her in the dust. I don’t know
why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still
in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My father used to have a saying, Jud– “God
sees the truth, but waits.”</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh…how is your cat, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s Ellie’s cat.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Nope. He’s your cat now.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: ELLEN&lt; crying.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ellie? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No more chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in
the world–even Mom said so. Now there won’t be any more because she’s
gonna be dead forever!</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems
almost beyond doubt: the dead are returning to eat the living.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What’s up, sugar?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to
heaven?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna
fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of
shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But don’t you dare say that.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I won’t…is Missy in heaven, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I don’t know, honey. Different people believe
all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in
heaven or hell. Some think we’re born again as little children–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you
rented, Audrey Rose.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, it’s actually reincarnation, but you
get the idea. And some people think we just wink out…like a candle flame
when the wind blows hard.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Do you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I think we go on. I’m not sure what happens
after we die, but yeah– I have faith in that.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh, faith’s a little more than just
believing.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do
you think my chair will be here tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then you have faith in that. But we don’t
know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in
while we’re away and steal it, right?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But we plan on that chair. We believe in that
chair. And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die. I
believe I will.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes ma’am. Just like I have faith that it is
now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed. So buzz.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m not tired!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m sure you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Then why do I have to go to bed?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Because your mother and I need the rest,
sugar. Now buzz.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I heard you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I thought maybe you did. I know you don’t
approve of the subject being raised–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s not true. The subject scares me.
Because of Zelda.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Your sister, I know.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sometimes you’re so good with her, Louis–so
straight with her–that you make me ashamed of myself.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sorry I couldn’t go with you to Missy’s
funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal
graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’s forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Not by me, it isn’t. I know how badly I
acted, how unfair I was. It’s just that I..you know.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes, I guess I do.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m going to try to do better.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You’re doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: An idling truck motor.</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Go, dayee!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hey, Gage!</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Dat?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: String! You’re flying it, Gage–you got the
hammer, my man!</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Gage fline it?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Bet your boots. Look–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Gage fline it!!</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: You–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: How do you like that, you son of a bitch? I
should have done it sooner!</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: How do you like that? How do–</p>
<p><strong>marcy</strong>: Stop them. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Come on! I’m ready for ya! I’ll take
y’apart!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Stop it! Jesus, what’s wrong with you, Louis?
It’s your son’s funeral, not a boxing match!</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: A man grows what he can…and tends it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I want to fly it! Can I fly it now,
mommy!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his
turn.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: I don’t know what happened to me. Louis,
please–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It got away from him! That numb shit!</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: Kite fline too fast!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The oncoming truck.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Don’t let him go in the road, Louis!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old
guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No…squatting out there at the Holiday Inn
like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel’s going to go back
with them. Her and Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Louis–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: What you got there, Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m going to carry this picture,
Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage come back.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ellie…God doesn’t do things like that. I know
you loved y’brother, but–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He can if He wants to. He can do anything,
just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for
him, that’s what I think. I’ve got his picture and I’m going to sit in
his chair–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ellie–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And I’m going to eat his breakfast cereal,
too, even though it tastes like boogers. And…and…</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Louis, take care of your little girl…she needs
you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: G’night daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: God could take it back if He wanted to,
couldn’t He? If He really, really wanted to? Can I have faith in
that?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes–I suppose you can. Good night, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I got you a fresh beer out of the fridge,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jud, I buried my son today and I’m very
tired. I wonder if we could just–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You’re thinking of things best not thought of,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m thinking about going to bed.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You never asked me if anyone had buried a
person up there in the Micmac burying ground–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: –but I think the thought has crossed your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Shit! Look at this mess!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh–it’s a mess, all right.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy
place…and then they thought it was a cursed place. That’s why they moved
on.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Because something called a wendigo soured the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: And because the dead walked.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Oh, ayuh. It’s been done. What you’ve been
thinking of has been done.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ll bite–what’s the bottom of the truth,
Jud?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Why…that sometimes dead is better. That’s all.
Sometimes dead is better.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: It ain’t your wife and little girl that’s got
me worried, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>sound bleeds in</strong>: Most of all the SOUND OF THE
CRICKETS.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Crazy laughter.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Oh holy Jesus lookit that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You men get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I heard your boy was killed down Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: Was it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You see him standing there, don’t you? Now get
out! Get the Christ off my land!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He ain’t dead! Give him a day or two and he’ll
be fine! Don’t you say that!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Bill, this ain’t right–you can see that
yourself–</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: God help you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Get out, Billy–the place is going up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: You think Bill’s gonna get out, Jud?</p>
<p><strong>gate agent’s voice</strong>: This is the final call for
United’s flight 61 to Chicago…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You better get going, hon.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh Louis, I just don’t know about this–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I told you last night–this can be the start
of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn’t come of
Gage’s death, I think I’ll go crazy.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Louis, are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t want to go to Chicago, Gramma
Dory.</p>
<p><strong>dory</strong>: Why not, darling?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I had a bad dream last night. A
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: About Daddy. And Gage.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And someone named Paxcow.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Come on, you guys–before you miss the
boat.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Louis, I am sorry. What can I say? That I
lost my mind? It’s the truth, but no good excuse.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Be good to your mother, darlin’. She needs
you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ll be there in three days–four at the most.
I’ve got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your
school so the truant officer ain’t after you, and–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Do you swear?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I swear.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Anything else for you today?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Looks like heavy work.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It could be.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Paxcow says it’s almost too late!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Ellie…Ellie…what…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Paxcow says it’s almost too late! We have to
go back! Paxcow says it’s almost too late!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s wrong. What happened to you is
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: The barrier was not meant to be crossed. The
ground is sour.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ll tell you where the ground is sour–the
ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby:
Wrong is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t talk like an asshole even if you are
just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: If it doesn’t work–if he comes back like
Timmy Baterman–I’ll put him to sleep. But I’m going to try. And if it
doesn’t work…they don’t ever need to know.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Paxcow says Daddy’s going to do something
really bad. He–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the
boogeyman?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He’s a ghost. But he’s a good ghost.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go
to sleep and forget all this nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Will you at least call and make sure daddy’s
okay?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Of course I will.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Now will you try to go to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Pascow.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Pascow? Was she saying Pascow?</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A car starting up.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’s not home.</p>
<p><strong>dory</strong>: Why, he probably went out for a hamburger or a
chicken dinner, dear. You know how men are when they’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Phone starts to ring.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s Rachel Creed, Jud. I’m calling from
Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No…we’re going to be here awhile, and he
wanted a few days to wind up our affairs there. I just wondered if he
was with you.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No–but if he drops by, I’ll tell him to call
you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Jud, do you remember the name of the student
that died on Louis’s first day at work? The one that was hit by a
car?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Was it Pascow?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Ayuh, I think ’twas. If I see Louis come home
before I go to bed, I’ll tell him to–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t bother. I’m coming home.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you, Jud. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: No! Rachel! Don’t do that! Rachel–!</p>
<p><strong>dory</strong>: Rachel…darling…you’re upset… a night’s
sleep…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have to go. The connections are tight, and
I have to be at O’Hare in forty minutes. Will you drive me, daddy?</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: You know something’s wrong, don’t you? You
know. And Ellie does, too.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: I’ll drive you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Please hurry.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I will. Come and kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: I’ll come with you if you want, honey.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Bing!</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: You done it, you stupid old man… now you got to
undo it.</p>
<p><strong>seatmate</strong>: Think you’ll make your connection in
Boston?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh, Gage–oh, honey.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s going to be all right…I swear it’s going
to be all right…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I ain’t afraid of no ghost.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: An approaching car.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: There’s just time. If you run.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: Don’t do that, babe.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Make it come back!</p>
<p><strong>female gate agent</strong>: I can’t–</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: You’re doing just fine.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: An approaching car.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Please God–let this work.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ain’t gonna stop, Gage. Ain’t gonna look
down.</p>
<p><strong>hertz clerk</strong>: I’m sorry…it’s been very busy tonight.
I really don’t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: What about the Aries K with the scratch on
the side?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I do have an Aries K, but it came in sort of
beat up–there’s a long scrape up one side–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: See? Just imagination. Just–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Nothing…there.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding
ones. Something is coming which sounds approximately the size of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and
louder. LOUIS looks plenty scared.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A falling tree.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I think the
Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It doesn’t matter. Come on, Gage.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The wind, lonesome and keening.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Tortured breathing. Panting.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: It’s trying to stop you. Do you hear me?
It’s trying to stop you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Is anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Come back to me, Gage. Come back to us.</p>
<p><strong>sounds</strong>: GAGE coming. Dead dry breath. Low snarling
noises.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hop in, baby.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The doorlatch. CHURCH MIAOWS.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Can’t you go any faster?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Lady, I got nine points on my license right
now.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I understand. It’s just that–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you. If you only understood how
important this is–</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: That’s all right, babe. Only if we get
stopped, next time I’ll be the one hitchin’ and you can give me a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Todd Rundgren, singing “Bang on the Drum All
Day” at the top of his voice.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Come on, stop playing games!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Molly Hatchet, “Flirtin’ with Disaster,”
being played top end, from upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Gage? Are you the one playing games?</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: Gage? Come on out.</p>
<p><strong>jud</strong>: I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Miaow!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: I didn’t get a ticket, so you’re welcome,
lady. Whatever your problems are, I hope they work out.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: It’s the end of the line for me, too–I’m not
allowed any further.</p>
<p><strong>pascow</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Who–</p>
<p><strong>church</strong>: Miaow!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Church!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Gage? Gage?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Gage–?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh my God. Gage!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Gage!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes, she’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She…Rachel’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ll call you right back.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Irwin, you’ll just have to–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What did you do? What did you–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What you buy is what you own, and sooner or
later what you own comes home to you. Wasn’t that what you said, Jud?
Wasn’t that pretty much it?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hi, Church. Want some grub?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t mind me. Eat it while you can. Eat all
you want.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Eat all you can…all you want… that’s
right…today’s Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from
the dead…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No, you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Rachel? Jud? Gage?</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A low giggle.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Another giggle.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Gage?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: All right, Gage…let’s.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m sorry, Jud. I’m so sorry. I’m–</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m going to set things back in order. I…I
know just what to do.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Gage?</p>
<p><strong>gage</strong>: No fair! NO FAIR!</p>
