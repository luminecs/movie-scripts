about.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?</p>
<p><strong>black pusher</strong>: No… yeah…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take
off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?</p>
<p><strong>black pusher</strong>: Man, I’m clean.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You made three sales to your roaches back

<p><strong>doyle</strong>: How about that time you were picking your

<p><strong>russo</strong>: Drink this.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Whip it out.</p>

<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What about the last of the big-time spenders.

farm in Hackensack.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Dig who’s just come over. The creep on the

the same without a number across his chest.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Whatta you say we wait and give him a

<p><strong>charnier</strong>: En prolongeant les quais d’une trentaine
de m�tres on pourra recevoir des unit�s d’une cargaison de 500
tonnes.</p>
<p><strong>foreman marcel</strong>: Et combien d’hommes
suppl�mentaires?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Ca fera environ 10 hommes de plus par
�quipe.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Le Syndicat exigera un minimum de 12.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Quelle importance. Ce qui compte pour moi
c’est d’avoir un chantier qui puisse recevoir les plus grands bateaux du
monde.</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: Dis moi vieille branche? Comment fais tu
pour rester si jeune avec la vie que tu m�nes?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Quelle vie Marcel? J’ai plus rien foutu

<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Pour moi?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Formidable! Sans toi je m’habillerais
encore en docker. Je suis pass� voir Fran�oise.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Comment va-t-elle?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Je n’ai jamais vu tant de s�renit�. Elle
m’a demand� de tes nouvelles et si nous �tions heureux.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Le sommes nous?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Non!</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Ca a march�?</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: Au poil.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Sale boulot.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: Il fallait le faire.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Il est en retard.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: Je crois qu’on fait une erreur de le prendre
avec nous.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Une erreur! C’est g�nial. C’est une
vedette � la t�l�vision. Il peut aller partout sans �tre soup�onn�… En
plus il a besoin de fric.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: J’ai pas confiance en lui.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Sois gentil avec lui. On ne sait jamais.
Il peut te faire travailler � la t�l�vision.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Henri c’est gentil d’�tre venu. Je vous
pr�sente mon associ�, Pierre Nicoli. Henri Devereaux.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: Enchant�. Alain, j’ai r�fl�chi � votre
proposition et j’ai d�cid� d’accepter.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Our friend’s name is SALVATORE BOCA. They
call him SAL. He’s a sweetheart. He once was picked up on suspicion of
armed robbery. Tried to hold up Tiffany’s on Fifth Avenue! In broad
daylight! Could have got two-and-a-half to five, but they wouldn’t
prosecute. Also downtown they’re sure he pulled off a contract on a guy
named DeMarco.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: His old lady?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Her name’s Angie… Fast filly… she drew a
suspended for shoplifting a year ago… only a kid, nineteen according to
the marriage license.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah, nineteen goin’ on fifty. What else?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: He’s had the store a year an’a half… takes in
a fast seven grand a year.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: So what’s he doin’ with two cars and hundred
dollar tabs at the Chez?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: The Merc’s in his wife’s name. Dodge belongs
to his brother.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Lou… he’s a trainee at the Sanitation School
on Ward’s Island. Served time a couple of years ago, on assault and
robbery raps.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: If that’s not a drop or a pickup, I’ll open a
charge for you at Bloomingdale’s.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Make it Alexander’s, I like the toy
department.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Toy wit’ this will ya.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: There’s about a hundred years’ parole time in
there night or day.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: They treat our boy like a king. Wonder why he
don’t bring his old lady?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: There’s your answer…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Who’s the greaser?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: It’s his father.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Suspicion of what?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Makin’ wine in the basement. He looks like
that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Lay off with that wop stuff, will you?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That’s the third time he come here this week.
You got anything on the building?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: The building’s clean. I checked the tenant
list – Don Ameche, the actor lives there – oh, and somebody else. Do the
name Joel Weinstock ring a bell?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You’re kiddin’</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: No sir – this is where Joel lives.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico
three years ago.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: So I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Whatta you know – he’s takin’ his wife out
for a change.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Got a job for me when this is over,
Mrs. Levene?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. levene</strong>: What are you fellows looking for? What
do you want from that nice candy store?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We have reason to believe it’s a front for
the biggest counterfeiting operation in the country.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. levene</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That’s right. They’re trying to steal the
formula for Hershey bars –</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What the hell am I drivin’ for? I’m a first
grade Detective. You’re a second grade guinea.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I’m wounded. Oh, oh.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: He’s goin’ to Ward’s Island. We’ll get
spotted. What the hell’s he goin’ there?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Maybe he’s goin’ to see his brother.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Or could be another drop. I guess he gets a
free ride.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hands on your heads. Popeye’s here!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What’s my name?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Mr. Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Milk shake anyone?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Move ass when I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Put it on the bar.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: All right, you three clowns step into those
phone booths, you’re goin’ in. Go on. Stand in there till I’m ready for
you.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Everybody goes when the whistle blows.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: What’s your story?</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: Gimme a break, Mr. Russo. I’m in show
business.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: You’re in show business.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: S’right.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What do you do in show business?</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: I’m a dancer.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: All right, get up on that bar and dance.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Get up on the bar and show me how you work.
If I like it you don’t have to go in.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: You’re for real?</p>
<p><strong>jerry leon</strong>: Hey man, why don’t you let the fella
alone.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Am I talkin’ to you -</p>
<p><strong>jerry leon</strong>: No, but I’m talkin’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I’m tellin’ you to shut up and stand over
there.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Get up there.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: I got no music!</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Fake it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: All right, that’s enough, you’re under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What about you? Can you stand a toss?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: I’m clean.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You don’t use shit?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Did I say you could move that hand – I’m not
gonna get stuck am I?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: No - no.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Cause if I do.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Wise guy, huh? Let’s see what else you got. -
Buddy!</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: If I see any shit on the floor, it’s yours,
so keep your eye on your neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: How’s everything?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Everything is everything.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: How come there’s nothing out there? That
stuff is all milk.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: There’s nothing around. Nobody’s
holding.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Boca?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Doesn’t register.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Got a wife named Angie.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: No, nothing. There’s only some talk.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Coming in this week, week after. Everybody
going to get well.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Who brings it?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where do you want it?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: This side.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I’m goin’ check on this address in the Bronx,
if you’re bullshitting me, it’s your ass.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Tell everybody we’ll be back in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We’re goin’ now! Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: How long will you be here?</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: Not long enough. Two… perhaps three…
weeks at most.</p>
<p><strong>girl tv reporter</strong>: Why did you come by ship,
Mr. Devereaux?</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: The next several weeks will be very
difficult and the middle of the ocean is the only place where the
telephone isn’t ringing all the time.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What will be the viewpoint of your
documentary.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: To make a Frenchman feel what it is like
to be a New Yorker.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: That’s enough now, ladies and gentlemen.
M. Devereaux is due at his hotel in half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: All that is great – but you guys work
Bed-Stuy. You’re not supposed to be in Ridgewood.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Detach us. Let us have a shot at it, at least
until we see if there’s anything here or not. Everybody wants Weinstock,
right? So maybe here’s a lead. We deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: You couldn’t burn a three-time loser with
what you’re bringing in here. You know you stiffs could run yourselves
an entrapment rap. The guy has done nothing – Brooklyn is full of Candy
Store guys with two cars who like to go to nightclubs.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Put this little candy hustler together with
Joel Weinstock and it could be we stumbled into a big score.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: Big score! He’s dealin’ a few bags here
and there on the side.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Simonson, I wouldn’t be infringing on your
coffee break if I thought he was a nickel and dimer.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: Your hunches have backfired before,
Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: Jimmy, what the hell’s happening with you
lately? You got more collars than any Narc in the bureau. What was it.
Over 100 last year? Terrific. But who?</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: You stop and shake down a bellboy because
he’s got three joints in his sock. You hit a high school kid in short
pants who looks like he’s got a twitch.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: We got information that there’s no shit in
the street – it’s like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming
in to make everybody well.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: This could be it, Walter. This Candy Store
guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections
all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we
tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who
do we come up with? Joel Weinstock. You gotta let us have it.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: You really believe all this crap?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I go with my partner.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: What’ll it take?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: First a wire.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Two wires. One on the store and one on his
house.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: You know I have to get a court order for
wiretaps.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Try… okay?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We know you can do it, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: Popeye…</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: You still pickin’ your feet in
Poughkeepsie?</p>
<p><strong>sal russo</strong>: What’s this crap. I just spoke to my wife
and she with a coffee cup. halfa cent on the cups. C’mere and lissen to
your Yeah, well you know I about a halfa cent. shoulda raised this here
a long time ago. We got a DOYLE inflation period… How we gonna keep
Simonson</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I got your inflation. I can RUSSO get the same
cups on Delancey If he does, we’ll be back in Street for what I been
Bed-Stuyvesant tomorrow. payin’ you for the last year – That’s all I
gotta do with you guys – next time it’ll be two cents on the cones, then
two cents on the seltzer –</p>
<p>****: C’mon Sal, I got my orders, too –</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Well, if you can’t do better than that, you can
stick the cups.</p>
<p><strong>high angle</strong>: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA
VALLE walking slowly together toward the camera. They are at the auto
graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off New York streets
by the Police Department. About twenty other men are walking around,
looking at the cars.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: There are four auto graveyards like this
one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.
Those that aren’t claimed are auctioned here once a month.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Just for mistakes of parking?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: No. Many are involved in crimes and
confiscated… or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source
of scrap metal, M. Charnier.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Darling, may I have this one?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: It looks so lonesome here.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: It would look even more lonesome in our
garage.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Every car sold today must be removed at
the purchaser’s own expense. We have no keys or anything to start the
vehicles with. You buy ’em as you see ’em and where you see ’em. All
right, the first car offered is Number 24398. A Plymouth sedan. Do I
hear fifteen dollars?</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: We go to 24399 – A Pontiac Station
wagon. Do I hear ten dollars?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: Notice he will never mention the year of
the car.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: I got a fifteen dollar bid going… Do I
hear anymore… Eighteen… who’ll say Eighteen? Twenty… Twenty-three…
Anymore… Twenty-five. Twenty-five once – Do I hear twenty-eight… All
right, last call for twenty- five…</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: And these are the cars we’re buying for
shipment?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: Yes, sir. That man in the dark jacket is
our buyer.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Takin’ care o’ business, honey.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Takin’ care o’ business – it’s after
midnight.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You know I hadda meet some people tonight –</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: – Well finish all your meetin’ people and get
back here now – and bring a pizza with you.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Where’m I goinna get a pizza this time o’
night?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Well try, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I don’t know where I’m gonna find a pizza joint
open.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Sal –</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Don’t forget anchovies.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: This broad’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: It was built in 1917 - and was one of the
two heaviest bridges in the world. The arch is still the largest in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Who financed it?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: Two railroads as part of a connecting
railway which provided passage from New England to the South. It was
actually the first railroad through New York City.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Why is it called Hellgate?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: The river at this point is the most
dangerous on the East Coast. Years ago, hundreds of ships went down
here.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: If this bridge were in Europe, it would be
on every tourist’s sight- seeing list.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: Most New Yorkers never notice it - most
Americans have never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Look how gracefully they conceived that
arch. Like a bowstring. It was built from both ends. With no support in
the middle. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Alain is the only man I know who can become
as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Not any woman, Marie. Just one.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: I’m afraid the rest of Ward’s Island isn’t
nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school
for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept,
prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The
Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: What is that old building?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: Oh, it’s been abandoned for years.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: It was a crematorium.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: For garbage?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: For dead bodies.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Allo… Salvatore…</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Who’s this –</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: … Salvatore?…</p>
<p><strong>sal russo</strong>: … Oh… yes… yeah… Who is it? hello… this
is Sal… How are ya? DOYLE</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Very well… you meet me RUSSO Wednesday at
the hotel…</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Good… good… great! DOYLE Will I expect you?
It’s here!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: What time?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Twelve o’clock… yes…</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Yes –</p>
<p><strong>whip girl</strong>: You’re Fifty Dollars short.</p>
<p><strong>whip girl</strong>: M’sieru - the tab for this scene is a
hundred and a half. Hey Frenchie - if you don’t come up with the
scratch, you’re gonna run into my man downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>whip girl</strong>: Don’t hit me. Don’t. Please.</p>
<p><strong>whip girl</strong>: You filthy faggot sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: This is the new American religion,
professional football. It is where everybody goes instead of church on
Sunday to express that peculiar American taste for bloodshed and
violence.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: These men, playing a “game” - make more
money each year than many important business leaders, artists or
government officials. It tells us something about this country and how
its men live, or go to war with a smile, and sometimes die without a
cause.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: It’s for you - Alain Charnier.</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: Hey, Bo.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hiya, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: Can you use a new suit for Christmans?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Whatta you got?</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: Whatta you?… a 44… 46?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where’d you get this fag shit?</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: This is what the tough guys are wearin’. You
know I only steal from the best. It’s Bonwit Teller.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Pass.</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: Forty dollars – was $250.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Whyn’t you get it dry cleaned and burned.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: A big man could alluz beat a little man.
That’s why Wilt Chamberlain could murder Jim Brown if they ever
fought.</p>
<p><strong>bad eddie</strong>: No chance. Brown’d kill him.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: Chamberlain’s seven foot tall, right? He’s
got a twelve-foot reach. It’s geophysics. He’s punchin’ down on you with
leverage. He cave your chest in.</p>
<p><strong>bad eddie</strong>: Best I ever seen was The Rock. He was the
calmest and the meanest. Guys like Sugar’d be pukin’ before a fight.
Jake LaMotta’d be pukin’. Marciano was calm like he was goin’ to church.
What about the night he fought LaStarza? He hit him so hard he broke the
blood vessels in LaStarza’s arms. He was the strongest meanest bastard
ever lived.</p>
<p><strong>puggy</strong>: Hey, Mutchie, give us another bullet.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: Blackjack Burns coulds been the greatest
ever –</p>
<p><strong>puggy</strong>: – He was a stone tanker.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: That’s right, he couldn’t fight legit. One
night at the Garden about 1950, ‘51 – he fought either Jake LaMotta or
Gus Lesnevich, I think it was – he took one o’ those cream puff punches
in the sixth – the laziest left you ever seen – missed him entirely.
Down goes Blackjack without even workin’ up a sweat and the whole Garden
gets up in its feet and I swear to Christ, everybody starts singin’
“Dance With Me Henry.”</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I fought a guy in Cleveland once. I knew he was
a dirty fighter so I stick a crowbar in my crotch. Right here. Second
round he gives me a shot – Boom – he breaks his hand, the fight’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>puggy</strong>: Fuck it, I like nitroglycerin, that’s my
game.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: What about you, Doyle? Who’s the best
fighter you ever seen?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Willie Mays.</p>
<p><strong>bad eddie &amp; lee</strong>: Willie Mays?!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: With a baseball bat! One swing! Knock your
fuckin’ head off.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: What ya doin’ out so late? Hidin’ from the
cops?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I hear the health department is going to
close this joint for selling dirty beer. I come by to help you carry out
your money.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: They’ll close you down if they ever get a
look at those busted-valise broads you run with.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You want some eggs.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hey, Mutch! You want bacon?</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where the hell is it?</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: Where the hell do you think it is, potato
head?</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: No wonder there’s so many Mafia around. Ya
couldn’t find a Puerto Rican in Spanish Harlem.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: I got this little chick I’m tryin’ to hit
on. She’s about 20, 21… I take her to Jilly’s last night and she’s
tellin’ me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married… I
says, “Hey, this is 1971, baby, I’m just a dirty old man lookin’ to
score with some pussy.”</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Strike out, eh?</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: Yeah. In the late innings. Ya look like a
night’s sleep wouldn’t kill ya.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: A piece of ass wouldn’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: When ya go back on?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Morning. Sometime.</p>
<p><strong>mutchie</strong>: Whyn’t ya stretch out on the pool table for
a couple hours. The kid comes in at six will wake ya. A couple eggs and
a beer is cheaper than keepin’ a dog around the joint.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You got a pedaller’s license?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Whatta you got – four more years,
Walter?</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Christ, by the time you get out all this
shit’ll be legal.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: The judge gave you ten days on these.
Klein and Mulderig will be sitting in for the Federals. Tell Doyle
they’ll make all the buys, and that they’re to be kept informed of
everything that goes down.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: You know Doyle, don’t you Bill?</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Sure, I know Popeye. The Master of
undercover, whose brilliant idea of disguise is to limp into a room on
his left foot and limp out on his right. Whose brilliant hunches cost
the death of a good officer –</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: If that’s how you’re coming in, why not stay
home and save us all a lot of grief.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: That’s just my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Whyn’t you shove it up your ass!</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Popeye.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Popeye.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: It’s Cloudy. Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Let yourself in.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: What the hell you got holding the door?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed. With
my own cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>bike girl</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: You oughta get plastic covers for this stuff
like I did - your scrapbook’s a mess like everything else in your
life.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Gimme my pants.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You got the warrant?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What do we need those pricks for?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Because by actual count our bureau has
exactly nine hundred eighteen dollars and fifty-four cents to make buys
and Mulderig’s Feds can get all of Uncle Sam’s money he wants by just
asking.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Throw ’em in the bathroom, will you? How good
are the warrants?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Sixty days. Here. Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Drive carefully!</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Strictly small potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: You really know how to pick ’em,
Doyle.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Still wearing your gun on your ankle?</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Somebody told me the reason you did that
was so’s when you met a chick and rubbed against her she wouldn’t know
you were a cop.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: I said that was bullshit. It must be some
kind of fast-draw gimmick or something.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Knock it off, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: He’s gettin’ too far ahead. You’re gonna
lose him.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Phil – it’s Cloudy – we lost him –</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: He just got off the Bridge - He’s all yours
if you can find him. Sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: the jam they form on</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You take Sal. I’ll stick with the beard if
they split.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: You want the red or the white?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Pour it in your ear.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Yes sir?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: That guy just walked in. What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t know who you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: He got off on six.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: We have four rooms and six suites on
six. There’s a man in almost every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Little shorter than me. Well- dressed. About
forty-five or fifty with salt-and-pepper hair, a beard.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: There’s nobody like that on six.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Perhaps he’s visiting a guest.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: No, I figure he stays here. Where’s your
registration?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: There may be two… no, three who could
fit it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Names.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he’s here
alone.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where from?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Des Moines.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What’s he do?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Businessman. Owns a department store in
Des Moines, I think.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be
another. He’s in shipping.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeh? Who else?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don’t
know what he does.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: This Charnier guy. He’s in shipping?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I think so. But they’re in Room 408. On
the fourth floor.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where’s he from?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Marseilles.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: That’s in France.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: You about ready for a break?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The guy’s a frog – I’m pretty sure. Also he
made me. Stayin’ on four but went up to six – cute.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: The other guy’s a frog too. Checked in at the
Edison. Had a hooker sent up.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Christ you should o’ collared him right
there.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Who’s on him?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Phil Klein.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: What about Sal?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: We put him to bed for the night.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Why don’t you do the same, Doyle? You look
like shit.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Look. My partner and I found this case and I
don’t want no Feds screwing it up.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Case? So far I haven’t seen a damn
thing.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Bill, keep shootin’ your mouth off and I’ll
knock you into the middle of next week.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Jimmy, cool it. Nothin’s goin’ down tonight.
Cop a few zzz’s while you can.</p>
<p><strong>chemist</strong>: Absolutely dynamite! 89.5 proof! Best I’ve
ever seen! If the rest is like this, you’ll be dealing for two years on
this load.</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: Retail is not my end of the business. Are
you telling me it’s worth the half million?</p>
<p><strong>chemist</strong>: How many kilos?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Sixty.</p>
<p><strong>chemist</strong>: Six kilos at eight big ones a kilo… I’d say
it should be able to take a seven to one hit in the street.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: By the time it gets down to nickel bags it’s at
least thirty-two million!</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: Thank you, Howard. Take what’s left there
with you and goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I guess we got a deal, eh?</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: We got a test. A deal for half a million
dollars, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Joel, the man is in a hurry. He wants the bread
and he wants to go back to France. He ain’t gonna hang around and play
games. He’s one o’ the shrewdest cats I ever run across.</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: What am I, a shmuck? What’s the hurry? He
could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State
Building.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Joel, don’t jerk me. I spent a lot o’ time
settin’ this one up.</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: So whatta you want a badge? It’s your
first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move
cautiously. You’ll never be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I been damn careful up to now.</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: Which is why your phone lines are tapped
and the Feds are crawlin’ all over you like flies.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I’m straight, Joel. They haven’t got shit on
me. Look, I’m tellin’ you, he’ll take the deal somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: He could go someplace else with his sixty
kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million
cash. He wouldn’t find there was any hurry to do this kind of
business.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Look, the stuff is here. We could set up the
switch in an hour. I’m tellin’ you, Mr. Weinstock, he’ll split if we
don’t move. This guy is everything they say he is.</p>
<p><strong>weinstock</strong>: What about you, Sal? Are you everything
they say you are?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You own that lamppost?</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Then how come you’re leaning on it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I ever bust you?</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: I never seen you before.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Get your ass in the car.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You gonna wait on me or am I gonna sit here
all day?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: C’mere… C’mere!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Can you stand a toss, Hector?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What you mean?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You still dealin’ shit?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Jesus, no, Doyle. I’m clean. I’m working twelve
hours a day here.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: When they going to make you chairman of the
board?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: You clean your fingernails with this.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Rather be caught with it than without it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I’m sittin’ on Frog One.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a
tent.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The Westbury? Balls. I got him down at the
subway at Times Square. What the hell’s goin’ on? I make him coming
right out of the hotel free as a bird. Not a soul awake.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I don’t care how many bartenders are sick. I
don’t work in that joint. What the hell kind of a union are you running
down there?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: This belonged to the kid who was drivin’
the sports car. 17 years old. His girlfriend OD’d in the car. We found
this set of works in her arm.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where the hell was the surveillance? “Go to
bed.” That’s all you could say. You couldn’t keep track of a bleeding
elephant in a snowbank.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: Jimmy, it doesn’t matter anymore. If there
was a deal it must have gone down by now. We blew it! We blew our cover
and we blew the warrants –</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Charnier and his wife checked out of the
Westbury. Nicoli checked out of the Edison –</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: This fella Nicoli’s got a record in France,
Walter. He’s wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I say we keep sittin’ on Boca.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: That’s crazy. You lost the Frog in the
subway and you blew our cover. If they haven’t moved already they’re not
gonna move now.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will
get the hell out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: With pleasure – it’s all yours. Walter, if
anything develops outta this charade give me a call.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: My ass. The only reason you’re in this is
because you’ve got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to
see your picture in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: This is my case. Get these guys off my back
and let me handle it.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: For chrissake, will you come off that “my
case” bullshit. This has been a whore’s dream from the start.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The deal hasn’t gone down yet Walter – I know
it, I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: The last time you were dead certain we
ended up with a dead cop.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: That’s enough. Get the hell out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>simonson</strong>: Jimmy, you wasted two months - no collars
are comin’ in while you two been out jerkin’ off. Now go back to work,
you’re off Special Assignment.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: It has been highly informative and a
personal pleasure to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: I only hope we cut through to some
meaningful proposals in the next month or so. The pleasure was mine,
Mr. Charnier. When will we see you again?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Soon, probably in the Spring.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: Goodbye. Good trip home.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Everything’s smooth. Beautiful. I will need a
few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile – make
sure there’s no heat.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: You must take me for an imbecile. Why do
you think I asked you to meet me in Washington? I haven’t spent five
minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Look, I’ll level with you – I need a little
more time – I got to shift gears.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Are you having trouble raising the half
million?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Hell no – my end is covered – my associates
just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the
switch.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: It has to be by the end of this week.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be
reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: It’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: It’s yours too!</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: So nice to have seen you again.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Look, darling, they sell these at the
Smithsonian.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Are you sure it is dead?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I’m going to put them on the cat.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: That’s a relief.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: You did find something for yourself, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Of course. But I am not going to tell you
what it is until we are back in Marseilles.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Excuse me a moment, darling.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: I’m afraid they’ve become a bit…
over-cautious. Our American friends.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: What happens to the schedule?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: We must follow it.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: But will they?</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: I don’t know. Boca is scared. He’s not
strong enough. He sees policemen in his soup.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: He is not wrong.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Mmmmm. That bastard who followed me on the
subway, he’s the eager one.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: Let me take him out.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: There’ll be someone else.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: What difference does it make? We’ll be out
of the country Friday.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Everybody, down! Get down on the ground!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Get down! It’s a sniper. Get down!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Stop that guy. He’s wanted by the police!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Where’s the next stop? Going into the
city?</p>
<p><strong>token attendant</strong>: direction the train</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Police!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Police! Emergency!</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Blind sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: Don’t stop! Continue on to the next
station!</p>
<p><strong>motorman</strong>: I got to stop.</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: Touch the brake and I’ll blow you in
half.</p>
<p><strong>motorman</strong>: The signal lights are automatic. If I go
through a red I’ll be automatically braked.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Didn’t stop. Went right through there… Hey,
man, that’s my station… Where the hell’s he going? Hey, stop the
car…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: He’s got a gun… The motorman’s gone crazy…
Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>nicoli</strong>: Get back.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Hey, you can’t…</p>
<p><strong>motorman</strong>: I can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: We’ll crash. Won’t somebody please help me.
Murder He’s a killer. Crash. We’ll crash! Stop. Stop the train.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Hey, Mac, have you seen…?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: …the guy who runs this joint?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Yeh. He’s over getting my car.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Can I help you…?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: He’s in the brown Lincoln - foreign
plates.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Timezit?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Same car.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Third time around.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Let’s him ’em.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Police! Don’t move… get you… hands up…
you’re under arrest…</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Up! Up, you sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Of all the goddam cars they had to pick to
steal hubcaps.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.</p>
<p><strong>mulderig</strong>: Nothing in there except a New York street
map.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Tumble it. One end to the other.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Nobody’s been under there with anything
but a grease gun since if came off the line.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I don’t buy it. The stuff is on this car.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Then you find it. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: The car was lost sometime this evening.
First they send us to Pier One – then they send us here –</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: I don’t understand why you had it
parked on the waterfront. You’re staying at the Doral and you lose your
car somewhere out by the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: In point of fact, M. Devereaux is scouting
locations for a film for French Television. He left the car to look at
some point of interest.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: We were told by the Police Commissioner’s
office that the car was brought to this garage. I demand its immediate
return.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: If you’ll be patient,
Mr. Devereaux.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: I have been patient enough. There is no
reason I should have to waste time with this red tape.</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: Mr. Devereaux is an extremely important
guest of this country. He is working with the absolute cooperation and
participation of your government. Here are his credentials from the
French Consulate. Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his
film I suggest you locate his car immediately.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: What are you looking for? Is it as big as
an orange or an elephant’s ass? I’ve been over every inch – top to
bottom. If you could give me a club – to the size…</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: What was the weight of the car when you got
it, Irv?</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: 4,839 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: You’re sure? The manufacturer’s spec says it
should weigh 4,719 pounds. This one’s carrying roughly 120 extra pounds
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: When it was booked in at Marseilles it
weighed the same. 120 pounds overweight. Jimmy has to be right.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: I ripped everything out except the Rocker
panels.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Got it for you, Randy – it just came in from
downtown. Who’s Devereaux?</p>
<p><strong>la valle</strong>: This is M. Devereaux.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we get reports
on a couple hundred vehicles a night. Sometimes it’s a little tough to
keep track.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: You mean the car’s here now?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Yeah – fine – it’s okay – not even a scratch.
You’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Someone stole it right off the street, huh?
You’re gonna have to pay the tow away charge.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: I was told these things happen in New
York – but one never expects it.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Yeah. Well, it’s in perfect shape. You must
lead a charming life.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Henri…</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Did you pick up the car?</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: It is waiting for you in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Did they follow you?</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: I wasn’t looking.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Henri… I need one more favor from you. I
know I am imposing…</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: My friend, I am not sure about what is
going on – but for me, I am finished.</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Not quite – you are in it whether you like
it or not. The police know you brought the car into the country. This
makes you an accomplice.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: An accomplice to what?! What have you
gotten me into, Alain? You asked me to do you a favor – and I did what
you asked – but you’ve taken advantage of me. I have my reputation –</p>
<p><strong>charnier</strong>: Calm down – Henri! You must trust me –
this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple
solution if you do exactly what I tell you. It’s worth more money to
you.</p>
<p><strong>devereaux</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>boca</strong>: Keep going. Right in there.</p>
<p><strong>first mechanic</strong>: Over there. On the right.</p>
<p><strong>second mechanic</strong>: The clear spot.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Bulls!</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Phil, you take that side, Bill, go around the
other way.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Cover the other side – Frog Number One is
down there.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: He’s gone, Jimmy. Bill is dead.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The sonofabitch is in here somewhere. I saw
him – I’m gonna get him.</p>
