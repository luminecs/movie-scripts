<h1 id="burlesque">burlesque</h1>
<p><strong>title sequence over music</strong>: A series of tight
CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high energy fast paced sexy
choreography. Very provocative. Legs. Arms. Butts. Boas. Sequins.
Costumes. High heels. A kaleidoscope of images and colors.</p>
<p><strong>end titles on a black screen</strong>: FADE IN sounds of
PEOPLE TALKING – GLASSES CLINKING – all the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY,
HIP NIGHTCLUB. SUDDENLY.. .a loud DRUM ROLL. CAMERA is low, moving
through BACKSTAGE, passing CURTAINS and the WINGS, flying out onto a
shiny black STAGE awash in light. PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now
blinding us, blasting into camera as they form the word…</p>
<p><strong>burlesque</strong>: DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The
SCREEN goes BLACK. Then we hear an opening MUSIC “INTRO”, a bawdy
QUARTET.</p>
<p><strong>extreme close up</strong>: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS… speaking
directly into CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Once upon a time …a long, looong time ago…
there was a good little girl…and they called her… REVEAL …TESS. A
stunner with impossibly long lashes, theatrical make-up and a sequined,
skin-tight band-aid of a dress. She works the tight stage of the club,
toying with the AUDIENCE.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Burlesque. MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG
BUMPER BAND – sax, drums, bass – wearing bowler hats, suspenders and
lots of ink. The crowd HOOTS. Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Some say she up and died-of neglect.
Abandonment.</p>
<p>****: .old age. The club’s red booths are about half-full with a hip
crowd. Walls cluttered with photos. Celebrities tucked in shadows.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: But I say…no matter how hard you try, you
can’t keep a good girl down. And I’ve got a bevy of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Come to think of it, none of them are all that
good, which isn’t all that bad… SEAN , a cute gay guy with an armful of
accessories pushes his way through the girls and in a blur, tightens a
corset, tosses a boa, adjusts a garter just so.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Eight shows a week. Sixteen gorgeous girls.
Thirty-two towers of luscious legs…</p>
<p><strong>back on tess –</strong>: Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the
stage one by one.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse. Anna. Coco-puff.
And Georgie-Girl. The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by
footlights, moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC. Hips sway.
Fingers snap. Tess weaves playfully between them.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: All of them the creme-de la creme.</p>
<p>****: De la creme. The girls strike nasty, provocative poses,
etc…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Each one a bastion of bodacious… Elegance. TWO
GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not to mention their other… Ass-ets. Coco
raises a brow, moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge, dead smack in
the center of the Sunset Strip– did I say “strip?” I meant TEASE…
FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their weight, hitting
the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE
suggestively toward the audience to the MUSIC…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Uh, excuse me? You forgot something. He turns.
Sees: ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on her
hip. Ali has a look that’s all her own: short shorts, white platform
sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than the rest of Grundy’s
women combined. She’s young – 22 – but has a confidence that’s got
nothing to do with age.</p>
<p><strong>regular</strong>: No, that’s your tip.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Huh. See, now that’s interesting – you and I
must do math completely differently, cause me? I start with the six
beers I brought you, add the four spills I cleaned up, the five times I
refilled your peanuts, plus the three times you “accidentally” touched
my ass, then I tack on lying to your wife when she called looking for
you, twice, and I come up with a sum that’s a hell of a lot more than
twenty-five cents. Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by
LORETTA – 30’s wearing every one of those years hard.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: She’s just teasing, Ike. You go on home
now, and tell Kay I said hi. The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the
quarter.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s better than nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Nothin’s cheap. A quarter’s an insult.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’ll cover half a load down at the Spanky
Clean.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: There’s only one thing a quarter is good for.
Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room, passing a
GEEZER who’s sitting by himself, drinking alone.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight feels
about that.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Dwight isn’t here. Ali stops in front of the
rinky-dink karaoke machine.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: He could come back any minute.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Tough. I’m not working here for the tips
Loretta. She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song. She
picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats, starts singing
ETTA JAMES’S “SOMETHING’S GOT A HOLD ON ME”.</p>
<p><strong>feeling, y-e-a-h</strong>: And now we see where the
confidence comes from. She’s got a voice that’s way too big for this
town– the kind that reaches way down inside you and rattles things
loose. WE HEAR the same song continue as we INTERCUT with:</p>
<p><strong>we intercut:</strong>: IN DWIGHT’S BAR, Ali is belting now.
Loretta is torn between enjoying listening and watching the door for
Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>never, never had before, no, no …</strong>: ON THE BURLESQUE
STAGE the Girls belt out a raucous chorus.</p>
<p><strong>yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhh…</strong>: As other ENTERTAINERS
appear onstage:</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: The insatiable La Puccini Triplets!
Death-defying daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille! The Countess of
contortion, Eva Destruction! And how about a little love for those bad
boys of burlesque, our naughty- bawdy bumber band! THE TATTOOED BAND
blares as the troupe kicks in unison</p>
<p><strong>that, oooh …</strong>: ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the GIRLS and
the BAND, loud and bawdy.</p>
<p><strong>ooooooooooohhhhhhh!!</strong>: IN DWIGHT’S BAR, Ali, letting
loose now. Wailing.</p>
<p><strong>yeah.</strong>: ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the BURLESQUE GIRLS
move in a line toward the audience, confident, sexy. The BARTENDERS,
WAITRESSES and people working at the club sing along.</p>
<p><strong>ba-da, ba-da, ba-da:</strong>: IN DWIGHT’S BAR, Ali, letting
it rip. The Geezer sips his beer, unmoved.</p>
<p><strong>sweeter when i talk. i said, oh.</strong>: ON THE BURLESQUE
STAGE, The Girls.</p>
<p><strong>ooooh.</strong>: IN DWIGHT’S BAR, Ali.</p>
<p><strong>oooh. hey baby, it must be love!</strong>: ON THE BURLESQUE
STAGE, The Girls form a line.</p>
<p><strong>you know it must be love.</strong>: IN DWIGHT’S BAR, Ali
sings.</p>
<p><strong>night, make me feel alright:</strong>: IN THE BURLESQUE
LOUNGE, The Girls, Tess, the other Entertainers, Busboys, Waitresses,
Bartenders and entire company do a BIG FINISH.</p>
<p><strong>ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da!</strong>: IN DWIGHT’S BAR, Ali
finishes the song. Loretta CLAPS. The Geezer, unimpressed, gets up and
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: People around here wouldn’t know talent if
it bit ’em in the Danglies. Where you gotta go is Des Moines. They got
karaoke bars where you can win a hundred bucks a night.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Loretta– when I get out of this butt-hole of a
town, I sure as shit won’t be heading for Des Moines. She hops up onto
the bar, spins around on her butt, one leg up in the air like a Varga
girl, then hops down on the other side then gets back to work.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Where the hell is Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Rehab, if there’s a God. The BACKSTAGE DOOR
BURSTS OPEN revealing–</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I heard that. Nikki, a stunning, feisty
brunette, sashays in–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Jesus, Nikki, you’re later than Georgia’s
period! Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Weave, wax, paws and claws. She drops her
bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out her arms as Sean slips her
corset onto her– Tess eyes Nikki’s body–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Hold it right there. Weigh in. Nikki
unwillingly steps on the scale. Tess shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Put on five pounds or I bump you. Nikki
protests as Sean double-takes at Georgia – who FLITS BY with a slightly
protruding belly.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Nanna? Got your pot roast here!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: They were out of steak fries, so I got you some
of those… Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna – 80’s, housecoat, oxygen
tank – is slumped in her chair. The TV remote is on the floor.
“ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT” is blaring.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Nanna?</p>
<p><strong>young minister</strong>: Dear Lord, we gather here today not
to mourn, but to celebrate the life of Alison Rose.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Arlene.</p>
<p><strong>young minister</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She’s Arlene. I’m Alison.</p>
<p><strong>young minister</strong>: Oh, shit. Can I start over? Ali
rolls her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>later,</strong>: The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk
away, leaving Ali and Loretta alone.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You were real good to her, Ali.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No, she was good to me. She rearranges the
flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And she wasn’t even my real Nanna.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Foster care. She took me in for the checks.
When I turned eighteen, the money stopped coming. She could’ve kicked me
out, but she didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She had a lot of pain at the end. Nothing she
talked about, but I could tell.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Well, then I guess this is a blessing. Now
she’s free. ON ALI, thinking realizing:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah. I guess she is.</p>
<p><strong>honey:::</strong>: In the wings, Tess watches with Sean.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Girls look good tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Amazing what a pink spotlight can do. Hides
more cellulite than a burka.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You’re three days late.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I had a death in the family.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: And what, people stop drinking cause your
grandma died? Get your apron and get to work.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m not here to work. I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>****: I just came for my back pay.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Payday’s the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But, I won’t be here then. And you owe me for
three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I don’t owe anyone anything till the end of
the month. Ali sets down her suitcase and marches over to him.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You know what, Dwight? Contrary to what you’ve
been told, there’s no law in Grundy that says you have to spend every
waking minute being a tight-fisted, cheap-ass prick –</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Ooh, hon, I’m not sure that particular
approach is gonna –</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ve spent three years of my life</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: –And you’ll probably spend another three.
You want to quit? Good riddance. I’ll replace you before you hit the
county line, but I sure ain’t gonna pay for the privilege. He walks out
the back door, slamming it behind him.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: THE CASH REGISTER. Ali opens the drawer,
pulls out a wad of cash. Peering out back to make sure Dwight isn’t
coming in, Ali counts out some money.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m only taking what he owes me.</p>
<p>****: How much was that bike you been wanting for little Keith? Ali
STUFFS a few TWENTIES into Loretta’s apron– pockets the rest.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Ali– where are you gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Somewhere I can breathe. Now gimme a hug, I
gotta get out of here before he gets back. Loretta hugs her tight, then
looks Ali in the eye, concerned.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You can’t just head off into the sunset
without a plan.</p>
<p>****: Watch me. Ali gives her one more hug, then grabs her bag and
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: She’ll be back. As Ali heads off, we
HEAR:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: How much to Los Angeles?</p>
<p><strong>ticket booth guy</strong>: One way or round-trip?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>in various layouts.</strong>: IN THE WINGS, Tess hands Sean
her corset as she slips into a slinky dress. He takes her cigarette
holder and grips it between his teeth as he zips her in.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: They’re loving you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: They’re loving you.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Oh, shucks, I just tell myself I’m writing for
a big old drag queen.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Eat me. As he heads off with her discarded
costume:</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: A big old foul-mouthed drag queen! Tess looks
in a mirror. As she makes the necessary adjustments, VINCE SCALI
appears. 35, scruffy-handsome.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Good show tonight. She glances up, sees him.
Gets icy. Goes back to primping.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Too bad the club’s half-empty.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Half-full.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: I got another call from Marcus Gerber.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: And you told him we weren’t selling.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: He wants to raise his offer. I told him we’d
hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Vince, I don’t care what the number is; the
only way Marcus Gerber will get this club from me is by prying it out of
my cold, dead, heavily- jeweled fingers. She pivots away and sweeps into
the club.</p>
<p><strong>oh, honey!!.</strong>: Big finish, the number on stage
ends.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: 102.7 KIIS FM. Broadcasting from Hollywood
and Vine… Ali perks up– looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend
and… THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN comes into view. NEW MUSIC UP:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p>****: Well. Good luck with that. He drops her suitcase on the bed and
stands there. Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh, hang on. She digs into her purse. All she
has is twenties. She peels one off and holds it out.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: If I could just get a little – But before she
can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves, closing the door behind him.
To the closed door:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: – change. She pulls open the blinds, they fall
off the wall with a CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the
window. The SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in. She digs out her cash, sticks
it under the mattress. Then she reconsiders.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey. I thought this was a single. The cat curls
up next to her. She checks his junk.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Typical. First guy I meet is neutered.</p>
<p>****: You don’t happen to know anyone in the music business, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>close on “backstage west” magazine,</strong>: Ali sips coffee
from a paper cup as she reads TRADES and WANT ADS spread over the floor.
She refills the lid of the cup, which the cat laps up.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Singer/Actress… Singer/Songwriter .Singer/Scuba
diver? Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>on another ad</strong>: It says: “SINGER/WAITRESS WANTED.”
MUSIC UP:</p>
<p><strong>a long line of 165 gorgeous, impeccably groomed
girls.</strong>: Ali stops in her tracks. Tougher competition than she
was expecting. She heads for the back of the line, passing girls doing
vocal warm-ups. One girl is belting out a riveting “SOMEWHERE OVER THE
RAINBOW”. Just as Ali gets in line, the door opens and a SKINNY GUY
sticks his head out.</p>
<p><strong>skinny guy</strong>: Sorry, ladies, that’s all the
applications we’re taking today.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: an ad: “DANCERS WANTED. PRETTY GIRLS
ONLY.”</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I can dance.</p>
<p><strong>drunk guy</strong>: She’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>alexis</strong>: Like I said, LOOK BUT DON’T TOUCH! ALEXIS,
drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make- up, TOSSES a GUY
out the front door onto the street, then heads back inside– Ali smiles
to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who disappears inside a BACK
DOOR as…NIKKI walks out. Lights a ciggie. She has on full make-up.
Lacquered lips. Lashes like peacock feathers. She sees Ali staring.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Didn’t your Mama tell you it’s not polite to
stare?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Sorry, you’re just – so DAMN beautiful.</p>
<p>****: In that case, screw your Mama, stare away. Nikki strikes a
pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They both laugh.</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: No one would ever guess.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That you’re a dude. Nikki’s face turns to
stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali sees the mistake she made. She’s
mortified.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: “Shit’s” right, you little half-wit</p>
<p><strong>twat–</strong>: Nikki is about to unleash when the stage door
opens.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Bitch! You’re on! Sean grabs her and drags her
inside. As he does, a STRAND OF CRYSTAL BEADS comes off her costume,
falls to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m really sor– The stage door slams shut. Ali
picks up the strand of beads. Holds them up in the light, watching them
shimmer. She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.
HIPSTERS enter. There’s a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos of the acts.
Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their elaborate costumes and
provocative poses. She’s unintentionally made her way to the front door.
Black curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool music
emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She ventures
inside…</p>
<p><strong>i.d.?</strong>: Alexis sits on a stool, glaring down at
her.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What is this place? A strip club?</p>
<p><strong>alexis</strong>: Strip club? Honey, I ought to wash your
mouth out with Jaegermeister. The only pole you’ll find in here is
Natasha the shot girl. Ali looks back at the photos.</p>
<p>****: Babycakes, shit or get off the throne, I got a club to fill
here. Ali digs her ID out, hands it over. Alexis scans it –</p>
<p><strong>alexis</strong>: Twenty bucks. Ali looks in her wallet. Sees
one lone twenty inside. She hands it to Alexis. He nods for her to go
ahead. Ali descends a staircase INTO THE CLUB… .and is BOMBARDED by:
colors, chaos, laughter, scandal – all shimmering, as if someone dunked
the place in glitter. And over it all, an incredible mash-up of old
music with a contemporary beat tying it all together. Ali ENTERS, rounds
a pillar, staring out into the room as a SPOTLIGHT finds the stage where
half a dozen OSTRICH FANS</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each
girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies,
hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have the
best view on the Sunset Strip! MUSIC KICKS IN AS LIGHTS FLARE from the
back of the stage, where Three Girls stand, backs to the audience,
Fosse-style. Coco, Georgia, and Nikki strut downstage. Behind them,
Girls MOVE AND DANCE on cabaret chairs. Totally raunchy, completely
timeless.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get you a drink? She turns. A bartender is
watching her watch. JACK - 25, punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm
half-sleeved with tats.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Only if you’re buying.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Welcome to L.A.</p>
<p>****: Is it that obvious?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You still have that new-car smell.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Not brand new. But still under warranty.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where you from? She looks back at the stage,
mesmerized.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We’re practically
related.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I thought you looked familiar. He smiles. As
Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a tray for a DITSY
WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She doesn’t notice. He barks at
her:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey_. Go.</p>
<p>****: Damn…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They don’t build ’em like this in Iowa,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hell no. I wouldn’t have left. She stares up at
the stage, marvels at the dancers.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So tell me – who does a girl flirt with to get
from here… to there?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is this you flirting?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: With someone wearing more eyeliner than me? He
laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading backstage.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ask for Tess. She’s your guy. Flirt away. As
she heads off–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Iowa– use my name. He hands her a card.
She looks at it:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thanks, Jack. She smiles, slips it in her
cleavage and heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Excuse me. I’m looking for Tess.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: So am I. And sometimes, when the lights are
dim, and I squint my eyes …I can still see her. She switches to mascara.
Sean, arms heavy with corsets, catches eyes with Ali, nods toward Tess:
“that’s her.” Ali steps closer to Tess.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hi. I’m a friend of Jack’s, and I’m-</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: New in town.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes, and I’m–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Looking for a job.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes, and I–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Want to perform here.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes. Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then
goes back to her mascara, unimpressed. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m a singer. A good one.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: This is a dance show.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I can dance.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Really? You a professional?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m a quick study.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not on my dime. Tess stands, a final check in
the mirror. Ali sees her chance</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Okay, I get that you’re busy so I won’t waste
any more of your time– but this place– I’ve just never seen anything
like it before and I know I belong here. So, how can I be a part of
it?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Twenty bucks at the door can make all your
dreams come true. Tess strides out, not looking back. Ali sees the Girls
trading glances, amused. She turns and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: One Dewar’s neat, one shot of Patron, and get
this, tough-guy in the hat? He wants a Cosmo. Jack looks at her,
surprised. Impressed.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: One night. If I’m not 20 times better than
boobs-for-brains over there, you don’t have to pay me.</p>
<p><strong>on ali’s white platform sandals,</strong>: weaving their way
through the tables. WIDEN to see she now wears a Burlesque Lounge
Cocktail Waitress get-up. She delivers a heavy tray to a table. She
heads back to the bar with empties, eyes glued to the stage, where Coco
and the GIRLS are dancing to “Wagon Wheel Watusi.” As Ali hits the bar,
Coco nails a stunning kick.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Her leg went behind her head!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, Coco’s the real deal.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I want to do that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She used to dance with the Joffrey Ballet.
Nikki sang opera. Eva performed with Cirque. Everyone here’s a pro. And
you’re on!</p>
<p><strong>backstage,</strong>: Nikki, lined up with the other girls,
peers between the curtains, spots Ali serving the drinks to a table.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What’s she doing here?!</p>
<p>****: I want that bitch out. Now.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What’d she do to you?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: She thought I was a drag queen! Stifled
giggles from the girls.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Can’t be the first time THAT’S happened. Nikki
is about to haul off on Sean when the CURTAIN OPENS, and WHOOMP!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: When he kisses me I get a thrill… The Cat MEOWS
and slinks out from behind the bed. Ali pulls the crystal beads out of
her pocket</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And when he does that wiggle I can’t keep
still</p>
<p>****: Cause he’s a tough lover.. .</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thanks. She heads back to the bar. As Jack
loads her tray up, she stuffs her tips into her pocket– SEES Sean,
looking her up and down.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Okay, girl, time for Sean to give you a real
tip. He ties her shirt up higher, undoes the top few buttons…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You got lips that could suck the chrome off a
Peterbilt, but that matte is about as sexy as a bedpan.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Now baby, go show ’em what you got. He heads
off. While Eva performs onstage, Ali delivers the drinks to a table of
SCENESTERS as Eva winds up her act in a flurry of fierce ballet moves,
finishing to APPLAUSE as… Ali notices someone waving her over. MARCUS
GERBER. 31, boyishly handsome in jeans and a ringer tee. Gold Rolex,
status sneakers. Charming. Charismatic. When Ali gets to him:</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dewar’s on the rocks for me. Bottle of Dom
for the table and– –And tell Nikki I’m here. Ali starts away, then–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: A member since 1991. Oh-kay. He smiles,
wickedly handsome. Ali pivots and heads back to the bar. Before she can
tell Jack the order:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dewar’s rocks, bottle of Dom, keep it
coming.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So Asshole’s a regular?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marcus Gerber. Real estate guy.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: He’s with Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This week. Vince goes over to Marcus’s table,
shakes hands, joins him.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Who’s that with him?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Technically your boss: Vince Scali. Tess’s
partner. And ex… Jack is about to lift the AmEx off the tray, when Sean
swoops by and intercepts it.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: A black AmEx! The backstage pass to life! He
sees Coco walking by, swipes the AmEx in her cleavage. She shudders,
then turns around and tips her ass up at him. He swipes the card
again.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Access denied!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Now there’s a first! Jack sees Ali laughing at
their banter. She heads off with the tray of Dewar’s and Dom as the
“Prince Nez” number ends.</p>
<p><strong>on stage</strong>: LIGHTS UP on TESS, CENTER STAGE as she
begins a new number, “Long John Blues.” A singing/spoken hilarious
interlude. The Girls back her up.</p>
<p><strong>it’s just your cavity, needs a little fillin’.. .</strong>:
As she continues… ON THE FLOOR, Nikki is sitting in Marcus’s lap,
nibbling his neck. Vince sits down beside Marcus. Marcus pats Nikki on
the butt, excusing her. As she heads off:</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: She’s on the verge.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: That’s what you said last time.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: She has no choice. We owe a balloon payment
of 100 grand on the first, she took out a second to buy me out of the
condo. And she just got turned down for another loan today.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: There’s a handful of these clubs around
town, I could buy one of them tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: But it wouldn’t be in the heart of the Sunset
Strip.</p>
<p><strong>again, and again, and again and again:1:</strong>: A RIM-SHOT
and BLAST from the band as the audience laughs. From the stage, Tess
notices Vince shake Marcus’s hand and leave. A flicker of irritation–
nothing anyone in the audience would notice – but it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>at the bar,</strong>: Ali brings a tray of empties over. Sean
is there.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Thanks. My lines. Our secret. Jack gives Sean
his drink. He walks off. MUSIC UP: An insanely cool version of Sly and
Family Stone “Everybody Is A Star” mashed up with a Fosse-esque
Burlesque rap.</p>
<p><strong>…</strong>: Song CONTINUES over a SERIES OF SHOTS: IN ALI’S
HOTEL ROOM, Ali plops down a bunch of BOOKS, OPENS The Golden Age of
Burlesque”, lays on her bed, petting her cat with her foot. She locks in
on a photo of 20’s-era Burlesque dancers over which we HEAR–</p>
<p><strong>everybody is a star …</strong>: IN THE CLUB, BURLESQUE GIRLS
strike a similar pose</p>
<p><strong>ali channeling the choreography as she:</strong>: - wipes
down tables with Jack in the club after hours, - flips through old Soul
records at a used LP store, - pokes her way through the scruffy street
folks that hang out by her hotel.</p>
<p>****: ON ALI’S BED, Ali flips to a picture of Mae West IN THE CLUB,
Tess cracks up the crowd</p>
<p>****: IN ALI’S HOTEL ROOM, Ali eats Chinese take-out as she pores
over the book. Turns the page to a photo of OLD SCHOOL ACROBATS over
“Everybody Is A Star”… IN THE CLUB, Daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille
nail an</p>
<p><strong>come out on a cloudy day …</strong>: IN ALI’S HOTEL ROOM, Ali
vamps, dancing to the song in her room in a t-shirt and undies. The cat
watches her, yawns and slinks away. IN THE CLUB, The Burlesque Girls
thwack down on chairs.</p>
<p>****: IN ALI’S HOTEL ROOM, Ali thwacks down on an old mustard-
colored chair.</p>
<p><strong>stopping til it’s in the ground…</strong>: IN THE CLUB, AN
OVERHEAD SHOT, THE BURLESQUE GIRLS now in different costumes in a BUSBY
BERKELEY cluster, AS CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON THEM and they separate to
reveal: ALI, center stage, belting UP AT CAMERA:</p>
<p><strong>slam cut to –</strong>: FIND Ali, in her waitress outfit,
watching the girls on stage, lost in her fantasy. She catches herself,
then moves along serving drinks while the Girls work the stage. The
Burlesque Girls continue their Burlesque Rap. When the girls thrust out
their hips in unison, Ali does too, unconsciously dancing along with
them. AT THE BAR, Jack notices. Watches. Tries to focus on pouring
drinks, but his eyes keep drifting to Ali’s hips. NEARBY, Sean notices
Jack noticing. Looks from Jack to Ali. Eyebrow goes up. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Nikki, do you even own a watch? Or do you
measure time in Patron shots? Ali enters with a tray of drinks. Nikki
swipes one.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey, no, that’s for – Nikki opens a bottle,
pops 3 pills in her mouth, washes them down with the drink, and sets the
empty glass on Ali’s tray.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You, I guess. Nikki turns to the mirror and
starts getting to work. As Ali hands out the other drinks:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Tess? Do you have a second? Tess doesn’t
answer. But a slight glance at Ali in the mirror shows she’s
half-listening.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I was thinking – see, I grew up listening to
all this music, I’d play the records over and over –</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Fast-forward, babe. I gotta rebuild Rome in
the next two minutes–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Now see– that’s what I’ve been thinking about.
There’s one thing I don’t get.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Just one?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: It’s the vocals. You have the girls
lip-synching. which is fine, I guess, but wouldn’t it be so much better
if they actually sang? The Girls trade looks, knowing Ali’s overstepping
here. Ali doesn’t feel the vibe-shift, surges ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ve been reading up on it, and back when
burlesque started, that’s what they did. Silence. Nobody moves. All eyes
on Tess.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Oh, no she didn’t? Tess slowly spins around in
her chair to face Ali. Peers at her with a supercilious gaze.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: “When burlesque started”? Which was…when?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh. Well… this book said it came after…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Vaudeville – is the word you’re looking for.
Derived from the 15th- century French expression “voix de ville” –
“voice of the city”. Popular songs of the time that were strung together
into stage shows. Which, over time, gave birth to another kind of show
in which talented girls showing a bit more skin danced, did skits, and,
_ yes, sang. In addition to being raunchier, these shows were funnier,
hence the new name. “Burlesque”: “comical” in French. Ali sees the Girls
enjoying this dressing-down immensely. Tess stands, peers down her nose
at Ali.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Dance major. Juilliard. I did my thesis on
Burlesque.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh. Ok. It’s just– It’s just that …I CAN sing
and–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: We can all sing. But they don’t come to hear
us sing. They come to see the best dancers in town backed by the
greatest singers in history. But tell you what: when you find someone
with better pipes than Sarah Vaughn, Billie Holiday and Etta James– you
let me know. She sashays out leaving Ali standing there with what’s left
of her dignity and an empty cocktail tray. The Girls launch back into
prepping for the show.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Georgia? You okay in there? A FLUSH. The stall
door opens. Georgia comes out shakily with mascara-smudged eyes, sweet
as ever.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: I don’t know why they call it morning
sickness when it hits at every freakin hour of the day. She rinses her
mouth out at the sink.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: There aren’t many women who could dance the
Charleston on a chair at - - what are you, three months? Georgia turns
sideways to the mirror, inspecting her bump.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Four. Can you believe my boyfriend hasn’t
noticed yet?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You haven’t told him?</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: I guess as long as he doesn’t know, I can
still imagine he’ll be happy about it. Oh my God, look what the cat
dragged in. She gets to work wiping away her smudged mascara.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You look pretty hot to me. Georgia reaches into
her corset, yanks one breast skyward, then does the same to the
other.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Yeah, well – you take what Mother Nature
gave you and milk the hell out of it, right? Coco enters carrying a
glass of tonic for Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Thanks, Coco.</p>
<p>****: Shouldn’t you be on the floor?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I had to pee. Is that okay with you?</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Not when you’re blocking my mirror it’s not.
Ali sees she’s in the way. As she steps aside:</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: That’s us. You okay, or are you gonna puke on
me during the number?</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: I can’t make any promises. Coco drags her
out, leaving Ali alone. Ali looks at herself in the mirror. Reaches into
her shirt and does the boob-hoist that Georgia did. Looks again.
Better.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey! They tear past her. She shakes her head,
reaches her landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees: HER
HOTEL ROOM DOOR, ajar. The lock broken.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No. No! She runs down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No!!! God damn it!!! She looks out the window,
SEES the ROBBERS running off, disappearing down the street. She kicks
the trash can. It flies across the room.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it,
damn it! She sees the cat watching her from behind the bed.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: A lotta help you were. The cat creeps out,
slinks around her legs. Ali plunks on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Shit. Then she sees, on the floor, the PHOTO
she took from Nanna’s. She picks it up. The glass has cracked, tearing
the picture.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ali? What’s wrong? You okay? She tries to
speak, but can’t – so she just nods.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Really? Cause, in my experience– when you’re
on someone’s doorstep surrounded by everything you own, there’s usually
a not-so-good story</p>
<p><strong>i– was–</strong>: And as she expected, as soon as she talks,
she starts to cry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit. No way!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Came in – busted the lock– and stole all my
MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!! She sobs–trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS
only heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And there’s no way I– sleep there– with– like
that– the manager said- - not till Monday– and I don’t– anyone else– but
then– so I remembered I had…but it went straight to…so I… She reaches in
her pocket, pulls out a card. It’s Jack’s that he gave her in the club.
It has his address on it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. I have no idea what you just said, but
come on in here and we’ll get it sorted out. She looks at him. Wiping
her tears. He picks up the heaviest of her bags and leads her to:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Have a seat. I’ll get us BOTH a drink. Here –
He hands her his phone. She looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – call whoever you want, long- distance,
whatever–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure you can. Go ahead. Her chin starts
quivering all over again.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I.. .don’t …have anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: To call.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No parents? Siblings? Aunts? Uncles?</p>
<p>****: Friends?</p>
<p>****: No one! No one, okay? Do I have to spell it out for you? I am –
completely – alone!</p>
<p>****: So…you’re not here to use my phone. She starts to cry
again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. Wait. No, stop, stop, stop, it’s okay,
it’s fine. You’ll crash here. No problem. Just, please – no more crying.
She nods. He grabs a bottle of Tequila and a couple of glasses. Pours
them a couple. They both take a drink.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Better? She nods.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. Good. She wipes her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Just for one night, I swear. Just till it’s
light outside and I can figure out my next move.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Deal. Then she opens her small bag and the cat
strolls out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whoa, whoa, you didn’t say anything about a
cat.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What? You don’t like cats? It slinks around his
leg. He shakes it off.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I hate cats.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: How can you hate a cat?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s easy, I’ll show you. The cat bolts into
the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where’s it going? If that thing pees on my bed
–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: He goes outside. We just have to open a window.
He’s very independent. She opens the window. The cat scurries back in,
leaps onto the ledge. Ali pets him. Looks at Jack, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t have a name for him yet. It purrs. Jack
eyes it warily.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: One night?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: One night.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why don’t you play at the club?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Make more money bartending.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You in a band?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Was… Guitarist moved to Reno, Drummer went to
med school, bassist is in rehab. I’m subbing around town till I regroup.
This is for a punk fusion band – their keyboardist is a flake, so they
call me a lot.</p>
<p>****: A flaky punk-rock-fusion keyboardist? No way. He smiles.
Continues playing. HIGH ANGLE, seeing both of them on either side of a
wall. Her listening, him playing. After a few measures:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey… He stops playing again.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why’d you leave Kentucky?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why’d you leave Iowa?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Cause I looked around and realized there wasn’t
one person whose life I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Exactly. A beat. Then as he starts playing
again:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey Jack? He stops again.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thank you. I’m really glad I’m not alone
tonight. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE CAT’S FACE, staring right into
camera.</p>
<p><strong>reverse on</strong>: Jack, waking up. As his eyes open, the
Cat licks him on the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Aauuuugggghh. He hurls the cat away and bolts
out of bed, disgusted.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Morning. Coffee?</p>
<p>****: Black. Like my soul. She pours him a cup. Sees a picture of a
BEAUTIFUL GIRL on his fridge.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She’s pretty. Your sister?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My fiancee. Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Fiancee? You’re straight?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course I’m straight. You thought I was
gay?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t know, the…make-up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s a look.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A straight look.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>****: And the floral couch…?</p>
<p><strong>ali/jack</strong>: Natalie. As Ali realizes she’s barely
dressed in front of a straight guy.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I should put on pants.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Probably. She bolts out to the living room,
starts digging through her bag, bent over. She’s in the doorway, so from
the kitchen, all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: New York. Doing a play.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Six more weeks. She can’t find pants. She
shifts, so now her ass is facing him directly. He tries not to look–</p>
<p>****: Oh, God, now I feel bad about this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t know. Now that you’re straight and
engaged, it feels weird that I came here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, you did, and it was fine. Aha! Pants.
She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He looks out. Her foot is
caught in the pants leg. As she hops around, trying to untangle it–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Or at least it will be as soon as you get
dressed. She tumbles out of view, thumps against some furniture. She
appears in the doorway, pants on, pulling on a sweater. She slips her
feet into her shoes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Alrighty then– I’ll get outta your hair
now…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait, where’re you headed?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh, don’t worry about me. I’ve got a plan. Come
on, cat. She zips the cat into the bag he came in.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hang on, let me at least spot you some cash.
I’m a little strapped, but I could –</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No, I’m good, if you could just She nods at the
door. He opens it for her.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thank you. For everything. You are my knight in
shining… eyeliner.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ll see you at the club.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Cool. She leaves. He closes the door behind
her. Stands there.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So, this plan of yours?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: .was to sit here at the bus stop and come up
with a plan.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come back inside.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No, Jack, I–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ll figure it out, this is not</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s pouring!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: It’s only water for chrissakes–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Jack– you’ve done enough and– In ONE MOVE he
SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Jack– No! Stop it! He grabs her bags and
carries her back across the street–</p>
<p><strong>please put me down–</strong>: He sets her down–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, you have nowhere to go, I have a couch.
You may as well stay here for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You really don’t need to do that. I’ll be fine
–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ll be homeless. You always have this much
trouble saying yes when someone is trying to help you?</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: It’s never happened before. The Cat jumps up
on the back of a chair, all wet, and SHAKES, splattering them with wet
cat smell.</p>
<p><strong>jack/ali</strong>: Aaaaargh! As his PHONE RINGS.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s a towel in the bathroom– dry yourself
and that damn cat off.</p>
<p>****: Hey, baby, how’s it going?… Really? That’s awesome…</p>
<p>****: That…? Just this person from work What? No, she’s just a
friend, I’m helping her out. Nat, it’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>o.s. music up</strong>: “BABY YOU’VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES” by
Brook Denton and Dinah Washington over…</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: the dancers auditioning, in small groups.
All shapes, sizes. Ali watching. Finally only a few are left.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Okay, front row, thank you very much. They
walk off stage, dismissed. Tess turns to Sean.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What happened to all the great dancers in
L.A?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: They’re busy “Dancing with the Stars.” Last
group, please. HALF A DOZEN DANCERS move to the stage. Ali watches from
behind the bar, thinking. Then, on her face, we see: an idea forming. ON
THE FLOOR, Tess and Sean check their clipboards, organizing for this
next set. They look up and start in:</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: All right, ladies, and five, six, seven –
whoa. There, in the back row, is Ali, in her white platform shoes.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re doing? Coco
and Georgia ENTER– surprised to see Ali on stage.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Trying out.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Tess, I’ve been singing and dancing my whole
life and–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: The girls here have years of training and
experience. This stage is for serious and professional</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey_. This is your club and you can be as rude
as you want–but don’t you dare tell me I’m not serious. Sean’s eyebrows
reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES Ali on stage.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I may not have been to a professional dance
school, but I have a lot of talent and I came to this town to do
something with it. And the only reason I’ve been putting up with all the
bullshit “attitude” I get from you is cause I want to do it here.</p>
<p>****: For the first time in my life, I don’t want to be someplace
else. So you’re gonna give me MY shot. Right here. Right now. Everyone
in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess just looks at her,
blinks, incredulous.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: One song. You don’t like it, I’ll quit and do
us both a favor.</p>
<p>****: Your call, lady. I know every number in the show. Sean, eyes
big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back</p>
<p>****: You know every number.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Which one do you wanna see? Tess looks at her
in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I said, which one do you wanna see? Ali just
stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to DAVE in the sound
booth–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Tough Lover! Tess plops down in a booth–
crosses her arms indignantly. ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies
herself, starts to dance. Behind a beat to two. She’s got the steps
right, but it isn’t clicking. She’s thinking too hard. No personality.
After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Okay then, next?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hang on. Start it again, please? As Dave resets
the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down and shakes it loose. Nikki
ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage–</p>
<p>****: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Shhhh. On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales,
breathing in attitude. Then she looks up at the booth again.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Anytime. The MUSIC starts in again. And this
time, Ali comes alive. She may not have perfect technique or the best
extension, but she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from
her before. It’s like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She misses a
step or two, but who the hell cares? On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes
popping. Tess is poker-faced. Coco and Georgia’s expressions turn from
dubious to respectful. Nikki’s eyes narrow. At the bar, Jack freezes, a
huge rack of glasses in his arms - - unable to tear his eyes away.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What are so you happy about, that’s your
replacement.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Yeah, but she’s really good. Tess and Ali
are in a stare down.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I want so badly to say something bitchy, but
nothing’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: There’s a first. Tess sighs, not wanting to
give Ali any props.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You were off the whole second half.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So, I was spot on the first half? Tess narrows
her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco and Georgia. Georgia
gives an effusive THUMBS UP– then suddenly becomes overcome by nausea,
covers her mouth and RUNS to the bathroom to puke– Tess rolls her eyes,
looks back at Ali.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh, you’re gonna be such a pain in my ass. Ali
tries hard not to beam–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Do I have the job, or not?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You’re not great. What you are is lucky.
Because I need someone tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and
leaves–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Even in those shoes that time forgot.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Theeeere’s bitchy. Nikki watches Tess go–
turns and pours herself a shot.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well– this totally sucks ass. Sean jumps up
on the stage.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Congratulations. The last time someone showed
Tess balls like that, she married him. You look like a checker at a Mal
Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your salary. Get a new look.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey, I happen to like the way I look.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Really? That’s a fascinating story. And then
what happens?</p>
<p>****: Backstage in five.</p>
<p>****: Welcome to the family. Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the
bar, where Jack is still standing, slack-jawed. She throws her arms
around him.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Sorry for the short notice, I quit! But hey–
with my raise I’ll be off your couch in a week. She squeezes him tight–
then heads backstage leaving him standing there, really turned on.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: First number, second number, third number… She
catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them, holding them up as
he tells her what they go with:</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: With the sequined bustier. With the shorts and
garters. With the beaded number. And those – I never want to see
again.</p>
<p>****: Oh! And – He hands her a prop GOLD MACHINE GUN.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: For “Miss Otis Regrets”. Just be sure you
don’t – Ali pulls the trigger. BOOM – GLITTER SPLATS all over Sean.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Admit it. You like her. It kills you, but you
like her. Tess meets his eye, then walks away. The number ends. The
girls rush offstage and peel their costumes off.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: My tits are up around my ears, my thong’s about
a mile up up ass, this corset is so tight, I haven’t breathed since
Tuesday and these lashes are thick enough to kick up a stiff wind.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It’s fun being a girl, huh?</p>
<p>****: Yeah. She hands him the last bits of her costume. FOLLOW Ali as
she heads to the dressing room. As she grabs her T-shirt and jeans:</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’m starving, who wants to go grab some pizza
before the next show? A general chorus of “Yeah?” and “I’m in.” FOLLOW
Ali to the bathroom as she throws on her clothes and washes off her
make-up, humming “Rich Man’s Frug” to herself. She heads back out to the
dressing room to find: EVERYONE IS GONE. She looks around. Feels like an
fool. She plunks down in a chair. Drops her bag on the floor. Looks at
herself in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Your brush is for shit. She turns and sees
Tess in the doorway. Tess comes over, takes Ali’s brush. Looks at
it.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Where’d you get this, the 99 cent store? She
chucks it in the trash.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Make-up is like wine. The good stuff costs a
fortune but is worth every penny. Where is everyone?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: All the girls went out for pizza.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Aren’t you one of the girls?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Apparently not. Tess reads her like a book.
Knows what went down. She turns to leave, then pauses at the door. Turns
back.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Don’t take it personally. Their love’s the
kind you gotta earn. Ali meets her eyes in the mirror. Then Tess grabs a
brush from her own station, tosses it to Ali.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Dip it in water first, or you’ll never get a
clean line. She leaves Ali alone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your stupid cat peed in the tub!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What…? You closed the window, what do you
expect?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your cat pees in the house, and it’s my_
fault?! Ali scoops the cat up.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been
desperate.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Goddamn cat. And you used my towel again.
How’s that apartment hunting coming? He GRABS the newspaper and tosses
it in front of her– she glares at him, then glances at the paper–</p>
<p>****: A thousand bucks for a studio?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can you really put a price on privacy?
Freedom? Your own bathroom? With clean towels?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Okay, Jack– I get it– His cell phone rings. As
he checks who’s calling:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Natalie. Hey, baby, how are you? He heads into
the bedroom, closes the door. Ali shakes her head, begins to peruse the
classifieds.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Guest studio, Hollywood, $900, with a yard, and
– oh. No pets. Screw them. She scans the ads some more. Finds a good
one.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ooh? Jack walks in. Looks like he’s got
something on his mind.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I think I found my new place. Where’s
Pomona?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go to Hell, turn left, it’s three miles down
on the right.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Really. How’s Beachwood Canyon?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Great, if you have a car.</p>
<p>****: Truth is, you should get a car first. This is L.A. You don’t
exist without a car. Plus, you can’t really afford a decent place
yet.</p>
<p>****: Tell you what.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m gonna suck it up and let you stay here a
little longer. Just throw in a little something for rent. She looks at
him, curious.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What about the “God damn” cat?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, I don’t like the cat. And I don’t like my
towel being wet. I don’t like the lack of privacy. But you’re in a jam –
and I’m the kind of guy, if a friend’s in trouble, I help. It’s just who
I am.</p>
<p>****: What did Natalie have to say?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing, you know just… hi. She narrows her
eyes at him. He concedes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And…her play got extended three more months,
so since she has to pay rent there, she can’t also keep up her part of
the rent here.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ah-hah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So if you could stick around and chip in, it
would –</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Save your ass?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – help. Ali looks down at his shoes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Well, will you look at that? The shoe, on the
other foot!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: One minute I’m a freeloader with a God damn
cat, the next, I’m the only thing standing between you and</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just – yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s the proposal, exactly? Jack looks at
her– realizes he’s screwed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The bedroom, with private bathroom access, for
600 a month, including utilities.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Closet?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Half . Ali picks up the paper, reads an
ad.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ooh, look! Hot tub!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine. The closet, too. She weighs it. Makes
him suffer. Then:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>****: Hey, I’m the kind of girl, if a friend’s in trouble, I help.
That’s just who I am. We HEAR an AUDIENCE laugh O.S. as we…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: So I said to the sailor, I may not be as good
as I once was…</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: But you can bet your sweet ass I’m better ONCE
than I ever was… The crowd laughs. Tess points to a woman who isn’t
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Drink up, sister! You’re a tad behind. Be a
dear and bring Mommy over there another scotch. The crowd chuckles as
the Bumper Band kicks in and the harem scene evolves into a sexy
tongue-in-cheek silhouetted dance.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: The distributor’s holding back the booze
unless we cut him a check.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Ply him with drinks, send Scarlett over to
flirt, and try to finagle him down to a half.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: How’s a third? He produces a check, all
filled-out, for her to sign.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Have I told you lately that I love you?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Got any brothers?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Drinking already?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yes, Mommie.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No. But I’m working on it. Nikki totters a
little. Tess looks her over.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’m pulling you from this number. Go home,
wring yourself out, and come back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You can’t pull me– Tess SPOTS Ali heading for
the dressing room–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Ali! Take Nikki’s spot.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: WHAT?! That bitch can’t dance my part!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Ali– get dressed NOW! Ali looks at Nikki– who
GLARES at her–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But, wait– Tess– that’s always been Nikki’s
number. Tess looks at her– she’s really had it with these girls–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: But this is MY club, and now it’s your number.
Ali looks between the two of them, Nikki glaring at her–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Is there a problem? You said you know the
whole show.</p>
<p>****: You can do anything, right? Tess just looks at Ali. Nikki
stares at Tess, livid, then storms off.</p>
<p><strong>the stage</strong>: Ali and the other dancers hit the stage
and start in on the vampy “TOUGH LOVER.” AT THE BAR, Jack is busy mixing
drinks. He glances at the stage, then DOUBLE-TAKES on Ali, looking crazy
gorgeous. She vamps forward with the girls, they rotate singing into the
prop mic.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Tess needs you. She said it was urgent.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I can’t leave here now –</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn you…</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Shit, okay – He checks his sound board – then
bolts from the room. Nikki watches him go LOOKS DOWN onto the STAGE as
ALI STEPS to</p>
<p><strong>thrill, and when he do that wiggle–</strong>: Nikki reaches
out and FLIPS A SWITCH. THE SOUND DROPS OUT. THE PLAYBACK STOPS. The
girls freeze in awkward poses, unsure of what to do. MURMURS in the room
as the audience looks around, confused. BACKSTAGE, Tess looks up at the
sound booth, sees it’s empty. Dave appears at her side.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You wanted to see me? ON STAGE – Ali looks at
flustered Tess…the girls…the audience. Panic. On the floor, Nikki
watches with satisfaction as she makes her way over to Marcus. Enjoying
the train wreck she caused. Then – in a flash, Ali turns to the
audience, and SINGS a’capella from the TOP OF THE SONG.</p>
<p><strong>oh–oh–ooooooooooh.</strong>: She looks around. Silence.
Mouths agape. Tess approaches in</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Close the Goddman curtain!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Hold on… Ali starts to sing again, her
version, slow, and sexy…</p>
<p><strong>lover. uh-ha…</strong>: Coco and Scarlett chime in on
back-up. Hearing them, Jessie and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off,
holding nothing back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of
them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping their feet
to the music. The girls singing back-up. In his seat, Marcus sits up a
little straighter – suddenly paying more attention. Unable to take his
eyes off Ali. The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with
hand-claps. All except Jack, who’s too spellbound to move.</p>
<p><strong>keep still …</strong>: ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast,
as the crowd engages like we’ve never seen them.</p>
<p><strong>tough lover. uh-ha…</strong>: The girls come alive, finally
able to sing a song they’ve been faking for so long</p>
<p><strong>tough lover. uh-ha::!</strong>: The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE,
knowing they caught a once-in-a- lifetime performance. Marcus stands,
clapping, whistling. Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances
to the wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she sees
Tess beside him, stone-faced.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Tess, when the music stopped–</p>
<p><strong>tess dave</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me you I have no idea
what happened. could blow like that?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I did. Tess spots a TATTOOED BAND GUY in the
door.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Do you boys know all the music?</p>
<p><strong>tattooed band guy</strong>: Hell, yeah. Nikki wanders in,
drink in hand. Tess looks at them all. Plants her hands on her hips.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Okay, then. Tomorrow night, Ali sings lead,
everyone else is back- up. Questions? Ali can’t keep from beaming as she
shakes her head, no!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Good. The Girls file into the dressing room.
Tess heads out, past Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: “People don’t come to hear us sing.”</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: No. But they’ll come to hear her sing. Dry out
and maybe you can back her up. She leaves. Nikki scowls. Sean grabs
Ali.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Bitch, you SANG that damn song! He heads off
to the dressing room, too, leaving Nikki and Ali alone together. Their
eyes meet.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: One of us has clearly underestimated the
other. She tosses her glass in the trash and leaves Ali alone.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Where’d you learn to sing like that? She
turns. Marcus is there. Handsome, charming and devious as ever.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You can’t learn to sing like that.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Well, you’re too good to be singing
here.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I just got into the show and suddenly I’m too
good for it? Shrugs, “but, you are” then–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: How about a drink?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Sure. Jack’s at the bar. Tell him I sent you.
It’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: But I hate lines. AT THE BAR - Jack looks
up, SEES Ali and Marcus talking. BACK ON MARCUS who looks Ali up and
down.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Seriously. You sound even better than you
look. Which is saying a lot.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Talk about a “line.” She smiles, amused, and
heads away from him, toward the bar. He watches her go. Tess intercepts
Ali.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Directions to the bar. As Ali heads off. Tess
glances back at Marcus, mistrustful.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You blew me away! Who knew you could sing like
that?</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Who knew any white chick could sing like that?
You channeled that shit.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: How the hell do you do that, girl?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t know, I can’t explain it. It’s like – I
start singing, and something starts to move inside me. It’s in my hands,
my feet, my gut,</p>
<p><strong>my thighs</strong>: She runs her hands over her body as she
describes it. Jack watches her – holy smokes. Sean notices his gaze on
her.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: and it just builds and builds till I feel like
I’m gonna explode.</p>
<p><strong>georgia</strong>: Trust me, I know what that feels like. I
have to pee. Again. She hops off the stool and scurries to the back.
Coco stands, to leave. Looks at Ali.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Wanna grab something to eat? Ali looks back at
Coco – validated. Accepted. At last.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah. Lemme get my bag. Ali moves off. Coco
goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack still watching Ali as she walks
across the room.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Well, will you look at that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You looking at that girl the way I looked at
you all those years. Only difference: you actually stand a chance with
her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I have a fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Three thousand miles away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We talk every day.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Let me guess what about: her, her and…oh! Her.
Jack shoots him a glare.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: All I’m saying is, this one’s beautiful on the
inside too. And she won’t be on the shelf forever. Ali comes back, ready
to go. Feels them stop talking and look at her.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I was just explaining to Jack that even
opportunity has a shelf life. Jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out
back. Sean looks at Ali more closely. He brushes her hair out of her
face. Then he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow. -
INT. SALON - DAY - Ali sits in front of a mirror while Sean gives the
HAIRDRESSER very specific instructions. - INT. JACK’S APARTMENT, AT HIS
KEYBOARD, Jack plays a high- energy style piano which runs over a QUICK
SEQUENCE: It’s the instrumental music to: “BUT I’M A GOOD GIRL.” - INT.
BURLESQUE LOUNGE - The Burlesque Girls dance on stage, performing a
high-energy tap dance, coupled with a European slap-dance, with the
slapping of each other’s bodies and faces integrated with tapping and
music. It’s very cabaret, but modernized with contemporary STEPPING.
CARRY MUSIC: - INT. SALON - LATER - The HAIRDRESSER spins the chair
around. Ali’s her hair is platinum blonde, with bangs and a Louise
Brooks bob that frames her face beautifully. Her smoky eyes pop like
never before. Ali studies herself:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where have I been all my life?</p>
<p><strong>what?. i am a good girl.</strong>: Ali finishes the song to
big applause. Takes her bow. Makes her way off the stage and ACROSS the
club to… JACK AT THE BAR - he turns to see Ali.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hiya, big boy. She spins herself around on a
bar stool, so he can see all angles. Jack likes plenty. Way too
much.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p>****: It’s…I think-you look…I mean, yeah… do you like it? Not the
reaction she was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Jack. It’s okay for you to think I look hot.
We’re friends for chrissakes. It’s not like we’re brother and
sister.</p>
<p>****: No. We certainly are not.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Why the hell is everyone having a conniption
over her? She’s just a tacky, pushy girl from a – Ali – sexy,
sophisticated, gorgeous – enters.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: – fly-over state. Ali pretends she didn’t
hear. She sits at her mirror. The girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali
picks up her mascara wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki’s
reflection.</p>
<p>****: What’s a fly-over state? Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand
over her lashes, then bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles
with appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Vince, if I were going to sell, I’d have sold
to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said
no.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Which made Marcus bump his offer up again.
It’s obscene, what he wants to give us. At least hear him out.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s very simple. I buy you out and pay you
a million off the top. Five hundred grand each. Tess looks up from the
contract, squints at Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Why do you want this club so badly?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Best view on the Sunset Strip.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Do you know what you could do with that
money, Tess?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Do you know what you can do with that money,
Vince?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Be reasonable. We’re rolling vendors ninety
days out.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: The club’s not even worth what you paid for
it. You’ve got a second mortgage, you can’t get a third. Tess looks at
Vince, betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Did you also tell him about the tattoo on my
ass?</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: It’s business, Tess. Not personal.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: My business. Which I built from the ground
up.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re not gonna get another opportunity
like this.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Exactly. She looks at a photo on her wall: the
Burlesque Girls, in all their glory.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Which is why I’ll never let it go. She gets
up, opens the door, ushering them out. Marcus shoots Vince an angry look
as they head downstairs. IN THE STAIRWELL, Vince reassures Marcus:</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Don’t worry. The balloon payment’s due on the
first. She doesn’t have the money. She has to sell. IN TESS’S OFFICE,
Tess stands in the doorway, having heard. Then she walks back to her
desk and sits, dejected. Head in her hands. For the first time ever,
looking worried and defeated. Something she’d never show anyone. A beat.
Then:</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Well. We’ve had a pretty good run. She looks
up. Sean is in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Maybe it’s time to just.. .hang it up. Let it
go. Call it a day. Tess’s eyes go steely with determination.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: No. You cannot say that to me. I can eat these
“sky is falling” dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but not YOU.
You cannot be that person. I’ve scoured dirty flea markets for costumes,
stayed up all night sewing till my fingers bled, painted and repainted
every goddamn wall of this place myself.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I choreographed every step of every number.
I’ve played nursemaid, sister, mother and shrink to every girl who’s
ever danced here. I’ve hocked every keepsake I’ve ever owned to keep
this place afloat. Because this club is the last of it’s kind, and if it
goes away, one day there won’t be anything like it- - and THAT would be
a tragedy. So you cannot say that to me. Because now someone’s gotta
believe in me, Goddamnit. And I need that person to be you. So don’t you
ever let me hear you say that again. I will never let this club go.
Never. Sean looks at her…a wry smile.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: There she is. Thought I’d lost you for a
minute. Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it
around his neck and exits. When he’s gone, Tess’s smile fades. IN THE
CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar cleaning up. He
starts stacking some chairs in the house as..SEAN CROSSES the floor.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Night, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Night. Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of
chairs to the side of the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS,
grabs a chair for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original
song. ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag over her
shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a column, SEES Jack playing.
She stays in the shadows and watches as he sings and plays a beautiful
song. The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up,
surprised that she is there.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Beautiful. You write that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just some sentimental crap. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Jack? Jack zips back to the door, opens it
quietly, then SLAMS it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey! Just got home! Ali grabs a dress from her
bed, slips into it.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: In here! Can you zip me up? In a nanosecond–
Jack enters the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey. Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Rehearsing. I’m playing a late show tonight.
As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO propped against
the lamp on the bedside table.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who is that? She picks up the picture. Looks
at it.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Me and my mom on my 7th birthday. She died just
a few weeks later.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She was so young.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: 24. There was so much she never got to do.
Sometimes I feel like, if I make the most of my life, part of her will
get to live a little more, too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wow. You must miss her. She puts the photo
down. Turns back to him. They’re close.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Every single day, something happens I want to
tell her about.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What was today’s? A beat. Their eyes
connect.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Don’t know. Hasn’t happened yet. They stand
there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of hair caught in the
earring. He pulls it away, freeing it. His fingers move through her
hair. She closes her eyes, feeling his fingers against her neck. Then
she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable to look away.
Until: His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from his
pocket. Checks who’s calling. Looks back at Ali.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I should… it’s… Natalie. Ali steps away from
him, disappointed. He answers the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, babe, how are you? Ali watches him walk
away from her, falling into the conversation with Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, she’s still here-What do you want me to
do, it’s not like you’re here helping out, you know…</p>
<p><strong>music up</strong>: An incredibly sexy saxophone which takes
us to:</p>
<p><strong>full close up</strong>: ALI steps into frame, starts
singing.</p>
<p><strong>a guy what takes his time…</strong>: PULL BACK to reveal
she’s on stage at the club with the BURLESQUE GIRLS. Finger waves and
1920’s sexy clothes.</p>
<p><strong>the song continues over:</strong>: - INT. JACK’S LIVING ROOM
- Ali lies on her stomach on the floor perusing a Fashion Magazine.
Across the room, Jack sits on the couch, PLAYING HIS
KEYBOARD–UNDERSCORING THE SONG. He looks at Ali. Watching her. Without
looking up, she takes a pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up
expertly. A few strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his
stare. Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her
magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she’s there. - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE -
DRESSING ROOM - Ali, the Girls and Sean getting ready. Georgia bursts
into the room, showing off an ENGAGEMENT RING. Everyone jumps up,
congratulates her. - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - The GIRLS and Ali vamp,
singing:</p>
<p><strong>spoils a master’s touch …</strong>: AT THE BAR, Jack watches
as he pours drinks. - EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON - Ali on the back of Jack’s
motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the engine.
Weaving through traffic on the Strip. The wind in their hair. Her scarf
tears away, lifting into the air… - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali and
Burlesque girls continue…</p>
<p><strong>know a guy what takes his time …</strong>: - INT. JACK’S
LIVING ROOM - Ali, Sean, Tess, Scarlett, Anna, Georgia, DAMON , hanging
out in the living room, decorated with party gear. The lights dim and
Jack and Coco enter with a birthday cake. They set it in front of Ali.
Ali looks around at her friends, drinking it in. She locks eyes with
Jack – then closes her eyes and BLOWS. - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali,
still singing her song.</p>
<p><strong>who takes his time…</strong>: PULL BACK to reveal A PACKED
HOUSE. The audience goes nuts. Marcus is at his table, clapping,
whistling, her biggest fan.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey – when can you cut out? I’m about to fall
asleep standing up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I have that gig, remember? In fact, I gotta
head out or I’m gonna be late. I can maybe swing you home before.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No, that’s okay, you go. I’ll grab a ride with
Coco. He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: By the way – you killed.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’ll drop you off.</p>
<p>****: Coco left five minutes ago. She realizes he was listening to
her conversation.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Sorry– I was coming to talk to you and
caught the end of your conversation.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Talk to me about…?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Dinner. With me. Gimmie that. He swoops down
and GRABS her dance bag and purse, turns and heads out.</p>
<p>****: If you ever expect to see this bag alive again… you’ll come
with me.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey…! Come back here…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I told you– to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Dinner? What about Nikki– What’s up with you
and Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: We’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where I’m from friends don’t chew each other’s
earlobes.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Aren’t you glad you left? Oh, damn!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I just remembered I have to make a quick
appearance at a party.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You just remembered.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It’s on the way. We’ll be quick. Ten
minutes, tops. Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And if I do.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Then you’ve been kidnapped. He turns off
Sunset and heads up into the hills.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Wow. Nice house.</p>
<p><strong>party guest</strong>: Hey, Marcus –</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hey, how you doing? He shakes the guy’s hand
and moves on through the party. Someone else calls out to him.</p>
<p><strong>another guest</strong>: Marcus!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hey, let me get a drink, I’ll be</p>
<p><strong>back –</strong>: Marcus pulls Ali in the opposite direction,
avoiding another GROUP trying to greet him. He grabs two wine glasses
off a tray, gives one to Ali, then pushes through a door into:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Marcus – you can’t just take that.</p>
<p><strong>shhh –</strong>: He hands her one tray, sticks a bottle of
wine in one pocket, throws an opener in another.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: They’re gonna throw us out of here.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Not if we sneak out first, come on. He kicks
open a back door.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Up there. He starts up some steps to an
outdoor gazebo. Ali follows. They pass AN INCREDIBLY WELL-DRESSED COUPLE
coming down.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, Marcus –</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hey, Guys. Greg, Marla, this is Ali. They
exchange hellos. Ali notices:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ooh. Killer shoes.</p>
<p><strong>marla</strong>: Aren’t they? Louboutins.</p>
<p>****: Great party, as always.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Glad you could come. Ali stares at Marcus.
He smiles, takes her hand, keeps leading her up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: You had to make an appearance at your own
party?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Would’ve been rude not to, right? You’d like
those guys. Greg’s the entertainment editor at the Times, and Marla’s a
designer. Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: I’m gonna dream about those shoes.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Thousand dollars a pop.</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: Jesus. Who can afford that?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I can.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey, I saw them first. He laughs as they reach
the top of the stairs and a BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE
CITY is revealed. Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of
L.A.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot prettier
from up here.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: It should. That view cost me three times
what the house did.</p>
<p>****: See that strip mall down there?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You own that too?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: No. I own everything above it.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: There is nothing above it.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You own…air?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Air rights. The guy who owns the strip mall
was having money issues and almost had to sell. Whoever he sold to would
have put in a huge tower. So I bought the air rights. Now no one can
ever build above one story.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Aren’t you the sly puss.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Mall guy gets to keep his property. I get to
keep the second best view in L.A.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s the first? He gazes at her. She rolls
her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: How many girls have you used that on?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: None who ever called me on it. He smiles.
Looks at her. Then…</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What do you want, Ali? In life. Girl like
you, gives up everything, gets on a bus heading for total uncertainty–
she’s got a dream. I want to know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Because you’re talented enough to get
whatever you want. And I’m smart enough to help make it happen. So? What
do you want? A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I want to be the best singer I can be. I want
to give as much joy as I get when I perform. And I want to die knowing I
made the most of every opportunity life gave me.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: That’s …so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: There wasn’t a dry eye in the house when I
said it at the Grundy County Junior Miss Talent Show. His eyes
narrow.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Why do you women always take advantage of
nice boys?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh, please. You are SO not a nice boy. He
clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ooh, I love this song. The Piano Player scoots
to make room. She sits beside him. He starts humming along. She does
too. Then he sings a line. She sings one back. And they fall in
together. Not vamping, not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the
music in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ali? He looks in. Empty. He checks the clock:
4:45. He hears a “meow”, and sees the cat. He picks it up, turns out the
light, and leaves the room.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Someone has a package! Ali sees A GIFT BOX at
her station. She reads the card: “You saw them first.” She opens the box
and sees the Louboutins.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Ooh. Faboo. Nikki picks one up – checking
their authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Who’s the sucker? All eyes turn to Ali. She’s
saved by Tess entering.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Coco-puff, shake a leg, you’re on in five,
Georgie-Girl, Ali-Cat – move, move, move – Tess exits.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ahh. My Nanna used to call me her Ali-Cat.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Yet another fascinating story.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Why doesn’t Tess have a nickname for me?</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Oh, she does. A knowing look amongst the
girls.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: She never uses it.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Sure she does.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Just after you leave the room. Nikki gives him
the finger and walks out. A beat. Then:</p>
<p><strong>girls together</strong>: Coke-whore. They crack up. CUE
MUSIC: “STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING”</p>
<p><strong>music continues over:</strong>: - INT. JACK’S APARTMENT -
Jack, playing his keyboards. Ali comes in, wearing the Louboutins.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You were out late last night.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I got a ride home with that guy– Marcus– we
went to a party. It was fun.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Marcus the Asshole?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah. Turns out he’s not so bad. She heads past
him, toward the kitchen. He notices:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: New shoes?</p>
<p><strong>ooh every day …</strong>: All the Bartenders sing, except
Jack, who keeps his eyes on Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s only one reason a man buys a woman
shoes, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So what if I’m getting a little male
attention.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You get a lot more than a little.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Not from anyone who matters.</p>
<p>****: I just think that you should be careful. Ali stops in front of
him. Hands on her hips.</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: And I just think that – if you really feel the
need to tell a girl what she should and shouldn’t do, you should pick up
the phone and call your fiancee.</p>
<p><strong>you…</strong>: After she passes… Jack’s eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>are happening!! happening .1</strong>: The SONG ENDS in a
flourish. There’s a CAMERA FLASH! FREEZE FRAME on the image: ALI,
belting onstage, with the Burlesque Girls striking a pose behind her.
WIDEN to see it’s a photo on the front page of the L.A. TIMES Calendar
section. The headline: “BURLESQUE HAS A VOICE:”.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey. Have you seen this?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What? Ali wanders out of the bathroom, brushing
her teeth. He shows her the paper. She SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>scarlett</strong>: No. That’s major.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Look again. The only thing major is the size
of your ass. Nikki walks off– Scarlett pick up the paper, looks closer–
Ali enters, dance bag over her shoulder, running late. The Burlesque
Girls and Sean all APPLAUD Ali smiles. Embarrassed. She curtsies
sarcastically. Coco points to a BOUQUET OF ROSES at Ali’s station.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: From Monsieur Louboutin, I presume. Ali reads
the card: “To the best view in L.A. - M”. Sean shoves her down in her
seat, pulls her coat off.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Shake your tail, Alicat, you still got a show
to do.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: To the girl of the hour.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m starting to think you’ll go to any
length.</p>
<p>****: I just made a call to Greg at the Times.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Well– I appreciate the kudos. And Tess
appreciates the business.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: This has NOTHING to do with Tess. This is
about you. And me.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You are so full of it. He laughs– takes her
arm–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I’ve got another friend I want you to meet.
She sees HAROLD SAINT sitting in the booth. He’s in his 60’s, still
dressing like Robert Evans in his heyday.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Ali Rose, Harold Saint.</p>
<p>****: Harold Saint? Shut up. You worked with Etta James.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Her, she chewed me up and spat me out, that
one. But with her voice, I forgive her everything.</p>
<p>****: You got a set of pipes on you, too, little girl. I like your
sound.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>****: I like yours.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: You ever recorded?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: We should do something about that. He
stands. Turns to Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: See you round, kiddo. He points his finger,
gun-style, which would seem cheesy, but he’s old school, so instead it’s
weirdly cool. He leaves.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Holy shit. Harold Saint. AT THE BAR, Jack
watches Ali and Marcus talking excitedly. Not liking what he sees. Sean
breezes by, grabs a drink.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You snooze, you lose, pretty boy.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Can you believe this crowd? He dumps the
costumes in her arms.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: ’bout time. These poor babies are begging for
your glue-gun. Tess walks off with the armful of clothes, so happy,
humming to herself, passes her OFFICE– OPENS the door to SEE– VINCE is
sitting at her desk. He flinches at the sight of her-</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Can you believe the crowd out there? Never
thought I’d see- She stops in her tracks, spotting Vince’s PANTS on the
FLOOR, and a TRAIL OF WOMEN’S CLOTHES to… THE NEW COCKTAIL WAITRESS,
peering out, half-dressed, from behind the curtains–</p>
<p>****: In my god damn office? She shakes her head– GRABS HER PURSE–
and walks out.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Tess. We need to talk. Tess rolls her eyes,
doesn’t slow.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not now, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yes, now. I’ve been here since the beginning.
We built this club together. And then some girl shows up out of nowhere–
who hasn’t even paid her dues–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I’ll get her to write a check tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And suddenly it’s her show?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: No, it’s not her show. It’s my show. But
people want to hear her sing. She’s bringing them in off the streets.
You better believe I’m building a show around her!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I can sing too! And you know it. But you
don’t give a shit. You always say this is a dance troupe, now suddenly
it’s not?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And you expect me to dance behind a girl who
struts in with a new pair of shoes she got for sleeping with Marcus
Gerber?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Nikki, you’re wasted. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I won’t be upstaged by some slut with mutant
lungs! Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: So don’t be! Leave! If you don’t want to be a
part of what’s happening here, then I don’t want you around.</p>
<p>****: You’d destroy our friendship and break up the group over some
girl you barely know?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Since when do you care about friendship? Or
this group? You’re a trainwreck, Nikki! You put tequila on your
breakfast cereal! I’m struggling to survive here, and you show up too
drunk to dance! You call that loyalty? Nikki just looks at her–</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Okay, then. I quit! Nikki stomps off. Tess
sighs –</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Marcus says you’re losing the club
anyway!</p>
<p>****: “They don’t come to hear us sing”</p>
<p>****: Stupid bitch. Nikki flips her off and keeps walking. Then turns
once more:</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: By the way: I slept with Vince the day after
your honeymoon. Tess’s eyes narrow. She grabs a HIGH-HEELED PUMP and
HURLS it. It flies through the air and hits Nikki in the back of the
head. Nikki SCREAMS, whips around, incredulous, to see: TESS, running
right at her. Nikki bolts, heading for her car. She jumps in, locks the
door just as Tess SMASHES her fist on the window and KICKS the door.
Nikki starts the car.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You crazy bitch! Nikki screeches off, leaving
Tess alone in the parking lot. Tess stands there a moment, then HEADS
back into the club.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Night, Tess. Tess looks up, Dave is closing up
the sound booth.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Night, Dave. Dave FLIPS a big lever, and
almost all the lights go OUT, leaving one shaft of light across the
stage. We HEAR Dave leave, as the street door closes shut. Tess alone on
stage.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You really need to do that at 6 in the morning?
He turns, sees her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Little overdressed for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: My pajamas were in my bedroom. Which was
occupied.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, you’re never here so… it’s stupid for me
to crash on the couch every night when there’s a perfectly good empty
bed. Jack grinds the coffee beans again. Ali winces.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So – you want the bedroom back? Is that what
you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The bed should be used by someone.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey, I’m home every night. Maybe not when you
think I should be, but last I checked, you were my roommate, not my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: However, since it’s an issue, what the hell,
take the bed, I’ll sleep on the sofa. I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ll have to move all your shit.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I realize that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Cause the room’s a total mess –</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ll move my stuff, God –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Clothes, make-up, shoes, hair things.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Jesus, Jack, what is your problem? Ever since I
started hanging out with Marcus, you’ve been acting like a class-A
prick. Is there something you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What? No. What do I care? You’re ambitious, he
can make things happen, go ahead, make a deal with the devil, what’s it
to me?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: First of all: He’s not the devil. He’s a smart
businessman. And oddly enough– a gentleman.</p>
<p>****: Second: I’m gonna take the couch, and you’re gonna 86 the
attitude. Or I’m finding another place to live. She storms out of the
kitchen, tripping over the cat– a LOUD MEOW! as the cat scurries away,
Jack intercepting him–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And try not to kill the cat!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A DIAMOND RING as it’s placed on the hand
of A VERY PREGNANT GEORGIA. Wearing an adorable mini-skirt maternity
wedding dress. She looks at DAMON with devotion. Ali, Tess, Coco, Sean
and Jack, all watching the ceremony. Ali looks over at Jack. He looks at
her, then away.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you mean, you’re still in New York?
…So you just – decided not to come? You think you might’ve wanted to, I
don’t know, let me know??? We haven’t seen each other in six months.
ACROSS THE TERRACE, Ali sees Jack yelling into his phone. Sean sees her
watching.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: .why does every conversation we have end up
being about YOUR future… Jack looks across the terrace at Ali. Moonlight
on her shoulders. A breeze in her hair.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: .you know what, you’re right. We both should
be thinking about our futures. And I might just be looking at mine right
now. Break a leg baby. Jack hangs up with finality and marches toward
the bar– His cell phone immediately rings again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I guess Natalie’s not coming after all.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Oh, please, that girl? Show up at a party
where she’s not the center of attention? AT THE BAR - LATER - Jack
drains one drink and orders another, getting very drunk. Ali sidles up
to the bar.</p>
<p>****: Shot of Patron. Jack raises his brow. Ali drinks the shot, and
without looking at him–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Lookin’ kinda lonely.</p>
<p>****: No. Not lonely. Liberated, yes. Libated, absolutely. But never
lonely. Cheers, baby– He raises his glass– she rolls her eyes, walks
off– he follows her, playfully PUSHING her from behind.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey– what’re we, in junior high?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You still mad at me, Iowa? C’mon. Bring it on.
She starts to say something as– THE SHIRELLES start to sing “BABY IT’S
YOU”– Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers at him and YELLS:</p>
<p><strong>i love this song, man!!!</strong>: Everyone stares at the
drunk guy. Ali rolls her eyes and walks off– Jack swings her around,
PULLING her close– she just looks at him. Starts to laugh at how drunk
he is– Jack wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her
ear.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: .Many many many nights go by, I sit alone, at
home and cry, over you…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Well, you’re quite the crooner. He looks her in
the eye.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry for being a class A prick. Ali
smiles, surprised at his candor. He breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And as of about…</p>
<p>****: .some time ago, I am officially a single man.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You and Natalie split up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That we did. So. That explains what I’m doing
here all alone. What are you doing here all alone?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Do I look alone to you? They share a look. Then
he spins her around in his arms. She laughs. AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and
Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances
down at them.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: That DJ’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: He keeps looking at me. Coco smiles up at him,
flirty. The DJ smiles back.</p>
<p><strong>coco</strong>: Hmmm…I think he’s cuckoo for Coco- puffs. They
look at each other, then crack up like giggling schoolgirls.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A KEY TRYING TO GO INTO A LOCK. Then it
disappears from view. We hear it CLANK to the ground. Then giggles.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Whoopsie daisy – PULL BACK to find Jack and
Ali, drunk, staring at the keys on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whoopsie daisy?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: My Nanna used to say that all the time. That
and upsie jumpsie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Upsie jumpsie? Upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy,
upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy, upsie jumpsie –</p>
<p>****: When would she say that?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: When she wanted her dog to get on the bed with
her. That is –</p>
<p>****: when she was alive. Their eyes meet. A connection. Then,
staring into her eyes:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The dog, or Nanna? Ali bursts out laughing. So
does Jack, as he pushes the door open, and they fall into the
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Help me. Jack gets the lamp to standing, then
grabs one of Ali’s boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the
second – it sticks – he pulls harder – the boot pops off and he careens
backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over again. Ali cracks
up. He turns to the lamp.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stay. He turns back to Ali, regains composure,
bows</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good night. He backs away, into the bedroom.
Ali looks confused.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh. Okay.</p>
<p>****: Good night. Jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the
door. Ali stares at it, surprised. Then resigned. Oh, well. She undoes
her bra, threads it through her top and out the arms. Then Jack’s door
opens. He stands in the doorway in matching “Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer” pajamas, leaning against the doorframe like Hugh Hefner in his
finest silk smoking jacket.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Cute jammies.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A gift from my mother. Never worn them.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Go figure. Jack walks past Ali, toward the
door.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Forgot to lock up.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Night.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Night again. He walks back into the bedroom and
once gain shuts the door. Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The
door flies open again – Jack’s there in just the pants, no top.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Water. No hangover. He stumbles past Ali to
the kitchen, drinks from the tap. After a moment he returns to the
bedroom, nodding to Ali.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Night. Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali
smiles, waiting. After a beat, the door opens again. Jack is there, in
boxers.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hungry. He walks past her to the kitchen,
opens a box of cereal, pours it into his mouth. Grabs some milk from the
fridge, pours it into his mouth, too. Returns to the bedroom, crunching.
He closes the door. Then – very quickly – he opens it again and walks
out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know I forgot something else, but I just
can’t remember what…</p>
<p>****: Door locked, water, food… He wanders out into the room, past
Ali, and we see from behind he is butt-ass naked. She cracks up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s so funny? She covers her face. He
glances down.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well I never! He strides back to the bedroom,
shutting the door. After a moment, he comes back out dressed in an old,
flowered bathrobe and fur-lined orange hunting cap.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I remembered what I forgot to do.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: Kiss you goodnight. He crosses to her, takes her in his arms,
and kisses her. She kisses back, making up for all their lost time.</p>
<p><strong>music up</strong>: “PRISONER” a big, soulful ballad.</p>
<p><strong>jack’s apartment - day</strong>: Jack and Ali in bed, in
post-coital bliss.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Well, it’s official.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You are definitely not gay. He smiles at her,
drunk with lust. CAMERA PANS UP AND OFF OF</p>
<p><strong>the club - night</strong>: Ali on stage, lights blasting.</p>
<p><strong>jack’s apartment - day</strong>: Ali and Jack in bed, in
different positions, wrapped in sheets. Jack traces the outline of her
lips with his finger.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ve been wanting to do this since you first
walked in the club. She cocks an eyebrow at him.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Sure got a funny way of showing it. He smiles
at her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll show you an even funnier way – you ready?
He disappears under the sheets. She SQUEALS, starts laughing
hysterically. CAMERA PANS UP AND OFF OF THEM THEN DRIFTS</p>
<p><strong>burlesque lounge - night</strong>: Ali, on stage,
belting:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So, what about Natalie…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Natalie who? Ali smiles. Rolls the stocking up
over her shapely thigh, then slowly takes it off. Looks at Jack. He
strikes his chest, struck by cupid–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do it again. She giggles, repeats the sexy act
for him. CAMERA PANS UP AND</p>
<p><strong>the burlesque lounge - night</strong>: Ali on stage, the big
finish:</p>
<p><strong>i knew it!</strong>: Jack bolts up in bed. Stares.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Natalie! Ali blinks awake. Confused.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Natalie? Jack scrambles for something to put
on.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: YOU are a LIAR. You’re a sneaky, pathetic
LI-AR!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What ’s she doing here:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I LIVE HERE, you bleached out tramp, what
the hell are YOU doing here?!!</p>
<p>****: You were engaged to this woman?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nat, can we talk about this in the living room
–</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I can’t BELIEVE I bought your bullshit:
“It’s nothing, she’s just this chick from work, she’s nothing.”</p>
<p>****: That’s what he called you. “Nothing. She’s not even pretty.
Well, at least you were honest about one thing–</p>
<p><strong>ali jack</strong>: You said that? No, I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>natalie jack</strong>: He most certainly did! Nat– shut the
fu–</p>
<p><strong>ali natalie</strong>: Jack?!? Don’t even say his name! As Ali
grabs for a shirt–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, Ali– let me just– would you mind –</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Giving us a little privacy?</p>
<p>****: You want me to leave?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yes you! I’m the fiancee. You’re a booty
call. You go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Natalie, Jesus, STOP IT! Ali grabs some pants
from the floor, pulls them on.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Fine, I’m out of here– You said you split
up!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: In one phone call? Please, you don’t dump a
girl like me on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Both of you– STOP IT! As Ali quickly grabs a
few things–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ali– I’m really sorry– I–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So am I. She gathers up more things, really
pissed–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait– do you need money for a Motel or… Ali
stifles him with an incredulous glare– can’t believe how this is going
down. She looks at him, so incredibly hurt. Grabs her suitcase and
brushes past him, stuffing her belongings into it. Jack goes after
her–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ali, wait a second– don’t– –go.</p>
<p>****: Shit. Jack looks at Natalie. She folds her arms.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry. I think I have the wrong
apartment. I’m looking for Sean? Brown hair? 5’10n? Early 30’s?</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: Oh, Sean! I thought he said John. He’s asleep.
Come in.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: That him? Ali nods. Sean’s eyes pop open,
confused to see her.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Long story. Sean notices the guy in the
blanket.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Ali, this is Mike.</p>
<p><strong>dj</strong>: Mark.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Mark???</p>
<p>****: Oh. Anyone want coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ll make it. You two get acquainted.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hey gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh. Marcus.</p>
<p>****: Is the coffee ready?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Mark. Or Mike. Jury’s still out.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Should I be jealous?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Only if you had your eye on Sean.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You okay? You sound down.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Mmm. Maybe a little.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I know just the cure.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Me. But you turned me down. She thinks for a
moment. Then:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Haven’t you heard? No is the new yes.</p>
<p><strong>another slamming door.</strong>: NATALIE’S HEELS storm away
from the apartment. Carrying her bags, really PISSED, she kicks a big,
fat rose blossom off a bush, and continues on.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Well. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You… Take care. Sean. Mark turns, heads down
the stairs as Jack rushes up, calling:</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is Ali here?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Just left. Mark continues down. Jack whips
around, looks at him, then up at Sean, who nods.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where’d she go?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: With Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I told you, opportunity doesn’t knock forever.
Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs. Sean shakes
his head and turns to go back inside. Then pauses, noticing: Mark,
looking up at Sean’s apartment, hesitating. Then he opens his car to get
in. Sean stands there, realizing he’s doing the same thing. He steps
onto the stairwell. Calls out:</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Hey! You!</p>
<p>****: It’s Mark.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Mark. You wanna have breakfast? Off Mark’s
smile:</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: My mother always said there’s only one thing
to do when you’re feeling blue… He opens the fridge and pulls out a
bottle of CHAMPAGNE.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She was a poet.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: And a drunk. Ali smiles. Marcus pops the
cork, fills two glasses, hands her one. Clinks.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: To your new place.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What new place?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: All yours. Unpack. Move in.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Marcus, I can’t just–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Sure you can. Marcus plops her suitcase on
the bed.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Unpack. You’re home.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: It’s not even on the bus route.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Okay, that is the first and last time the
term “bus route” will be spoken in this house. Four cars. Which do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Better?</p>
<p>****: Better. She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: You’re gonna be on one of those someday.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Sooner than you think, too. Harold Saint
called me today. You made quite an impression on him.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Really? What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: He wants to make a demo with you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Are you serious? When??</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: He found a little studio time on
Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: This Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Too soon?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No! Oh my god, no, that’s amazing. You’re
amazing.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: I like making you happy. Your whole face
lights up. Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I think you’re way too nice to me.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: And that’s a problem because…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ve had a lot to drink. And my judgment is
off. He touches her face, their chemistry palpable.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Hey, I’m a gentleman. Which means I’d never
kiss a lady when she’s… vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Liar. She leans in and impulsively pulls him
into a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where am I? She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF
MARCUS on the wall. She raises her brows then sees her disheveled
reflection in a huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Who am I? She sees her and Marcus’s clothes in
a trail on the floor and bites her lip, remembering last night.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Now it’s a model. But when it grows up,
it’ll be a mixed-use space: retail and residential.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: This is the address of the Burlesque Lounge.
Marcus shrugs, dries his hair.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Best view on the Sunset Strip, with no
windows. When I’m done with it, it’ll have a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You can’t tear down the club.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Actually, I can.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But what about the history? That place is a
landmark.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Not according to the city.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Does Tess know about this?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: What Tess knows and doesn’t know isn’t a big
concern of mine.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What makes you think she would ever sell the
Lounge?</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: She has no choice. She’s going under.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But that club is her life!</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Oh, come on, you get this. It’s business.
It’s not personal.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Not personal? It’s pretty god damn personal for
Tess! And Coco and Sean and Alexis. And what about Jesse? And Dave the
lighting guy?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And what about me? It’s pretty God damn
personal to me. She turns to leave.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: To the club. Where I work. She marches out of
the room, resolute–</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Ali– wait!!! At the door she turns back and
looks at him. As he starts to speak, she SLAMS the door shut as we HEAR
“THAT’S LIFE”.</p>
<p><strong>in the race…</strong>: The whole club is with him now, as
Jack channels Sinatra, standing on the bar– the Bartenders sing
back-up.</p>
<p><strong>ball and die. my, my.</strong>: Applause, hoots and hollers.
Jack high-fives and fist pumps his buddies, hugs Sean, grabs his bag and
suitcase and EXITS out the back as… Tess ENTERS. SEES Sean is at the
bar. He looks up–</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: How’d it go? Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Right now? Get really drunk. THE FRONT DOORS
OPEN, and Ali ENTERS, spots Tess, rushes over to her.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Tess! I have to talk to you! Tess keeps
walking.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Marcus Gerber is trying to buy the lounge, and
he’s gonna tear it down and build a twenty-story skyscraper! Tess stops.
Slowly turns and stares at Ali, who’s suddenly embarrassed to admit…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I just saw the plans. Tess looks at Ali.
Stunned. Ali stands there, breathless, waiting for her reaction. But
Tess just turns, continues up to her office, and shuts the door. Ali
turns to Sean– then starts after her–</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She has to do something! She can’t just let him
–</p>
<p>****: Let it go, girl. She just got turned down for another loan.
It’s either foreclose, or sell to Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So that’s it? It’s over?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: The circle of life, baby. All good things must
come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But she can’t just give up!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: She’s not giving up. She’s going down with her
ship. With dignity. Ali sits on a barstool, in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I’ve got something for you. He pulls out the
photo of Ali with her mother. It’s in a new frame.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Jack. He dropped it off on his way to the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where’s he going?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: New York on the red-eye.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: To be with Natalie?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Pedal faster, baby, he and Natalie are over.
You’re the one he’s been looking high and low for.</p>
<p>****: Really…?</p>
<p>****: Then why’s he going to New York?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Get your ass over to LAX and ask him yourself!
Ali nods, jumps up from her stool, and races for the door, then stops,
realizing:</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t have a – Sean tosses her his CAR
KEYS.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: American to JFK. Go! Ali catches the keys and
TAKES OFF. - EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT - Ali peels out of the lot,
weaving through traffic as she lifts her cell.</p>
<p><strong>- int. airport - night - close shot</strong>: a CELL PHONE in
a plastic bowl moves through a security X-ray machine.</p>
<p><strong>jack’s voice</strong>: This is Jack. Leave me a message. FIND
Jack on the other side, as his belongings come down the conveyor belt.
He grabs them, turns off his cell. - EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ALI skids
through a light, veers past cars. - INT. CONCOURSE - NIGHT Jack reaches
gate 43, sees a long line. Gets in back. - INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT
- Ali bolts through the front door, frantically checks the DEPARTURES
MONITOR. Finds: NEW YORK JFK, GATE 43: NOW BOARDING. - INT. TERMINAL -
NIGHT - Ali races up the escalator, approaching SECURITY.</p>
<p><strong>security guy</strong>: Boarding pass?</p>
<p><strong>al i</strong>: I have to talk to someone, he’s –</p>
<p><strong>security guy</strong>: No one’s allowed past this point
without a boarding pass.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But I have to speak to him!</p>
<p><strong>security guy</strong>: I’m sorry, miss.</p>
<p><strong>security guy</strong>: There’s Gate 43, right over there.</p>
<p><strong>jack! jack! jack!</strong>: ALL HEADS TURN to look at her,
except Jack, who can’t hear. A PLUMP WOMAN in front of him looks at Ali.
Ali points to Jack. The woman taps Jack and points. He looks to see:
ALI, on the other side of Security. Jack takes his earphones off and
smiles. He crosses over to her, carrying his bag. They are separated by
several feet of security ropes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Sean told me you’re going to New York. Please
don’t go!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I have to. I got an offer from that band – the
Punk Fusion group. They want me to tour with them.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They finally had it with the flaky
keyboardist. I’ll be back in five weeks. Will you be here?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes! Yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What about Marcus?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: .Marcus who? They share a smile, separated by
the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m trying to figure out if I should kiss you
now, or make you wait five weeks.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Five weeks?! That’s forever!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A MALE AND FEMALE SECURITY GUARD,
listening to the whole exchange.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I gotta go, that’s me. He picks up his bags.
It’s killing Ali.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll call you when I get there. Take care of
Miles Davis. Our cat. I named him. They smile again. Neither wanting
this moment to end. She waves. He nods. Then he turns and walks off to
board. Ali watches him go. ON JACK, walking back to the gate-then – he
stops. Turns back to see Ali, but she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>female security guard</strong>: Boy, you get out there and
kiss that girl! Now! Jack looks at her, then quickly turns to walk past
the Male Security Guard.</p>
<p><strong>male security guard</strong>: Go ahead– but you’re gonna have
to come back through Security again.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But then I’ll miss my flight!</p>
<p><strong>female security guard</strong>: Martin! Don’t you dare keep
that boy from kissing his girl! Martin looks at Jack. Then:</p>
<p><strong>male security guard</strong>: Ah, hell. Go ahead. Bag stays
here. Jack drops his bag, takes a running JUMP over the ROPES and RUNS
through the crowded concourse – startling everyone. ON ALI, as she walks
through the concourse, reliving her last sight of Jack. As she’s about
to get on the escalator:</p>
<p><strong>ali!</strong>: She turns. Jack is there. In one fantastically
romantic move, he pulls her into his arms, kisses her deeply – an epic
kiss that makes passersby stop and stare.</p>
<p><strong>to new york jfk at gate 43.</strong>: Jack looks at Ali.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Well, go get ’em, Jack. He smiles, then
disappears into the crowd. Ali stands there, watching him, gobsmacked by
the kiss.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each
girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies,
hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have…
.the best view on the Sunset Strip. The audience hoots as the Burlesque
Girls ENTER the stage dancing. ON ALI– a lightbulb going on! As Tess
exits the stage, Ali pushes through the crowd and races backstage.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Tess!</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You could knock– this is still my office–at
least for another 48</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But this is really, really – Tess holds up a
hand.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not. Now.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I said – NOT –</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes now! God damn, you are one stubborn mule of
a woman. Anyone else in their right mind would have figured out by now,
when I have something to tell you, you listen! I told you I could dance,
did you listen? No. Big mistake. I told you I could sing, did you
listen? No. Big. mistake. This time you are going to hear what I have to
say if I have to tie you up with your corset strings and scream it in
your God damn ear. For the first time someone silences Tess. Ali takes a
breath.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Have you ever heard of air rights?</p>
<p>****: Jim – Jim – hang on, I’m gonna have to call you back – Jim!
Damnit, Nancy, get him back. Assistant scurries out. Businessman turns
to Tess.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Back with more noise complaints?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: You offered to buy my club a few years back. I
said no.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: And now you’ve changed your mind.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not exactly. Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali,
who’s not smiling. She elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to
the desk and sits herself down. Ali does the same.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I’m confused.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Go with me, there’s a good ending, I promise.
How much will these condos you’re building sell for?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: They start at one million and go up,
depending on the view.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What if I told you a twenty-story high-rise
was going up where my club is?</p>
<p>****: Would twenty stories block his view?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ten stories would. Twenty would decimate them.
Leaving behind a lot of angry homeowners staring across the street at
fluorescent light bulbs and dirty windows.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: So. Mr. ?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million- dollar
ocean views are going away because I’m selling my building to a
developer tomorrow who’ll have his twenty stories all framed up by the
time you start selling –</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Trying to sell–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Trying to sell these condos.</p>
<p>****: Or. I can put you in a position where your buyers could be
guaranteed their million-dollar views forever.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: As am I. As long as you’re telling me you’ll
have a check to me by 5:00 today.</p>
<p><strong>cocktail waitress</strong>: Sorry, baby, they cut you off at
the bar. Said you have to pay cash.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What? I co-own this goddamn place–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not anymore you don’t. I’m buying you out.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: You can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Actually, according to page 4 of our contract,
I can.</p>
<p>****: In the next 48 hours?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Why postpone joy? She hands him a CASHIER’S
CHECK. Vince stares at it.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: I realize it’s been a while since you’ve seen
one, but it’s called a check. He stares at it, stunned.Then at her.</p>
<p><strong>vince</strong>: Where’d you get this?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not your business anymore. And neither is the
lounge.</p>
<p>****: I’m sure you know where the door is. It used to be half yours.
And take HER with you. Tess turns and goes over to the bar, where Ali
spins around on her barstool, having heard the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: How’d that feel?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Not half bad.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: It felt pretty God damn awesome! And they
crack up again. Then…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And to think, you didn’t even want me
around.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Oh, Jesus, here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: .What was it you said to me that first night?
“Twenty bucks at the door will make all your dreams come true.” That was
sweet of you.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Kinda ironic, when you think about it. I
started off begging you to make my dreams come true, and here we are
–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: All right already! You want me to say it, I’ll
say it. She looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: This place is the love of my life. The only
dream I’ve ever had. I don’t know what I would have done if I had lost
it.</p>
<p>****: Thank you. A moment between them… as Tess SPOTS NIKKI ENTER the
club carrying her dance bag–a little fresher than we’ve seen her before,
and sober. Nikki looks over at Tess… then approaches. Ali turns away on
her bar stool, respectfully.</p>
<p>****: I crossed the line. Tess crosses her arms, and with a smirk on
her face–</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Again, and I wanna come home–</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or
what…?</p>
<p><strong>tess</strong>: What do you think? Tess and Nikki share a
look.</p>
