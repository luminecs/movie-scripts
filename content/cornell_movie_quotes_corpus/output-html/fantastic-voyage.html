<p><strong>man</strong>: Sorry we had to get you up at this hour,
Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I thought I was on my vacation… What’s it all
about?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I can’t tell you that either… Excuse me,
Mr. Grant, but you’ve got a smudge on your cheek.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What’d you do that for?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m married.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: And she said it was indelible…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re to stay inside, Mr. Grant. And wait…</p>
<p><strong>22- <out></strong>: 39</p>
<p><strong>42- <out></strong>: 43</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Your I.D. card, please.</p>
<p><strong>46- <out></strong>: 50</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The Pentagon, wasn’t it, General? Only you
weren’t in that uniform…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Benes… What the devil happened?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: The Other Side got to him.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How bad off is he?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Brain injury.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Before or after what he wanted to tell
you?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Before he could breathe a word. He’s the
only scientist who knows the answer to what we’re after. That’s why we
have to operate –</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: – and why we need you.</p>
<p><strong>53- <out></strong>: 55</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I can’t even put a Band-Aid on my finger.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Here’s the Surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the
country. Ever hear of him?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sorry, but I’m rusty on surgeons. Who’s the
girl?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
You’ll join Duval and the others –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What can I do? Except maybe pass out?</p>
<p><strong>carter’s voice</strong>: Mike…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of
the Medical Section.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Wish I knew why.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Tell him where he fits in, will you? I’ve
got a few things to check out.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: We need you for Security purposes,
Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: At an operation?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: They know they failed to kill Benes.
Security thinks they’ll try again, first chance they get. We’re afraid
of medical sabotage – or surgical assassination.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Surgical assassination?! But that means you
suspect –</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I don’t agree. Just because he’s often
difficult –</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Difficult? He’s impossible!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: That’s no reason to suspect him of
disloyalty.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: But why take the chance, when there must be
other doctors?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: We have no choice. Duval’s the most skillful
brain surgeon in the country, and he’s right here, at hand.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I wouldn’t know if he’s trying to save him or
kill him.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I’ll be standing by. &lt;I’ll&gt;
know.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And no matter what happens, you’re to take
orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Come along, they’ll be operating shortly.
See you later, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>57- <out></strong>: 61</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: His technician okay? In addition to the Looks
Department?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No question of her loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I don’t mean to be inquisitive. But this
<CMDF> – for all I know it could stand for
<Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Say that again?</p>
<p><strong>63- <out></strong>: 74</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: We can reduce anything down to any size we
want. People – ships – tanks –planes…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: General, I’ve heard some wild ones. But this
takes it.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: We can shrink an Army – with all its
equipment – and put it in a bottle cap. That’s why we call it
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing
like that…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: They have… But we’ve both got the same
problem – lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for
exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its
original size.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I assume Benes knows how to control it.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s right. He wanted us to have the
secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: They’re bound to try again. No wonder they
want me to stand by during the operation.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And take a little trip with them…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Trip? Where to?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Well, the only way to reach that clot is
from inside the Brain. So we’ve decided to put a Surgical Team and a
Crew into a submarine – reduce it way down in size, and inject it into
an Artery –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You mean &lt;I’m&gt; going along?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: As part of the Crew.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Wait a minute! They can’t shrink <me>!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink
anything.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: But I don’t want to be Miniaturized – !</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s only for an hour –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir,
I’d like you to reconsider your choice. I’m just not the right man for a
mission of this kind.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Come on, Grant. You’re going to a
Briefing.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Miss Peterson volunteered to come along!</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: So did every male Technician in the Unit. A
woman has no place on a mission of this kind.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I insist on taking my Technician.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: You’ll take whoever <I> assign!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Don’t tell me whom I’m to work with! Not on
this operation or any other! I’ll do what <I> think is best, without any
interference from anyone!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Dr. Duval has relied on Miss Peterson for
years. And since she wants to come along, I’m sure it’s for the best,
Dr. Reid.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: I don’t agree with you – but since you’re in
charge, you can do as you please. But I want to go on record as being
against it.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Grant – Colonel Reid, Operation Commander.
You’ve met our Medical Chief.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Oh yes, I’ve heard of you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Miss Peterson, his Technical
Assistant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How are you, Miss Peterson?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: This is Captain Bill Owens, designer of an
experimental submarine for the Navy’s ‘Oceanographic Research and
Development Program.’</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Out of your element, aren’t you, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Grant’s uniquely qualified for this mission.
He’s a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides,
he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about
him, the better. At any rate, you’ll find Grant invaluable, should
anything go wrong once you’re under way. Okay, Don.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Here’s the overall Target Area…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Benes’ brain…near as we can map it
stereotaxically…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: The clot’s right here…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Impossible to get at – – without damage to
the intervening tissue…which would prove fatal to Benes.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: The only way to reach it is via the Arterial
System.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Phase One calls for Miniaturizing a submarine,
with Crew and Surgical Team, and injecting it into the Carotid
Artery.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: How small would that be?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: About the size of a microbe.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Colonel, I’m sure that’s quite a comfortable
size, but –</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Reduced proportionately, you won’t find it too
strange –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: All in a day’s work, sure. But I was thinking
of the speed of the Circulatory System.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: About forty miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to
microscopic size – and the stream remains constant – we’d take quite a
beating.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: I hope you’ve taken that into account –</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: We have.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: You won’t be going anywhere near that fast.
We’re putting Benes in deep Hypothermia – that is, freezing him low as
compatible with human life. It’ll slow down his heartbeat, Circulation,
and all other physical processes.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Even so, because of our size – I mean lack of
it – we’ll still be cruising mighty fast. We’ll be smashed to bits if
there’s any turbulence –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: The only danger of turbulence is in the
Heart – and we’re not going through it. Once in the Carotid Artery,
we’ll remain in the Arterial System… until we reach the point of damage
– – where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam.
After the operation, we’ll return by way of the Venous System – – until
we reach the base of the neck – – where we’ll be removed right here –
with a hypodermic.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How will you know where the sub is, at any
particular moment?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Dr. Michaels – our Circulatory Specialist –
will serve as your Navigator. He’ll know just where you are. And you can
communicate directly with us, by wireless. Besides, the sub is
nuclear-powered, and we’ll be tracking it just as we would any
radio-active tracer.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: There’ll be a team of Surgeons standing by.
We’re prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In
any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you’ll be
in danger of attack.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Attack? Who – or should I say what from?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Benes’ natural defenses. White Corpuscles –
Antibodies. Once you begin to grow – and become a menace to the body –
you’ll trigger them off… MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the
body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should
reconsider –</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: We understand your concern, but we’ve made
our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Just one, General…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Where can I get a cab back to town?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Proceed to the Sterilization Section.</p>
<p><strong>78- <out></strong>: 80</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How much can a man give to his country?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Make the final preparations…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Heart.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: How’s it look, Henry?</p>
<p><strong>heart specialist</strong>: Holding steady at thirty-two per
minute.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Respiration.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: How’s he doing, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>lung specialist</strong>: Respiration is now six per minute…
I wouldn’t take him down any further.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Hypothermia…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Any problems, Dr. Sawyer?</p>
<p><strong>hypothermia specialist</strong>: No sir. We’re holding him at
twenty- eight degrees Centigrade.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Where do we stand?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Medical’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: They’re in the Sterilization
Corridor –</p>
<p><strong>83- <out></strong>: 88</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Don’t touch me. I’m sterile.</p>
<p><strong>carter’s voice</strong>: Please board and check all your
equipment immediately.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Here’s the particle, sir.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Everything aboard?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: All squared away, sir.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Hold this…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Atomic fuel?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But
there’s a microscopic radio-active particle inside.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: If it’s no military secret, how can a sub run
on a microscopic particle?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: They can’t reduce nuclear fuel. But once the
Reactor’s Miniaturized – along with the submarine – a microscopic
particle should emit enough energy to activate it.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s cutting it mighty close – for a
perfect fit.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: It should work – theoretically. If it
doesn’t, the mission’s off. The craft’s nuclear-powered. Except for your
wireless.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: All in all, quite a canoe…</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Designed for Piscatorial Research – the
Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Remind me to ask you about the love life of
an octupus.</p>
<p><strong>95- <out></strong>: 96</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Test message from the Proteus,
sir. ‘Miss Peterson has smiled.’</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: That’s an auspicious sign.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Confirm receiving.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Captain, how will you be able to follow my
charts – –from up there?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: On the Repeater.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Once the power’s on, we’ll be in direct
touch. Come, I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: That’s it…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Looks simple to operate.</p>
<p><strong>owens’voice</strong>: It actually is, although the controls
are highly sophisticated. There’s a button for everything –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Bet you’re pretty handy around the house… Can
you cook?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: We’re pushing oxygen today.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’ll take some Laughing Gas, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You sound as if you’re not looking forward to
it.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, it’s not exactly a pleasure cruise.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I think it’s the most exciting – We’re going
to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of
Life itself – not something under a microscope… Just think of it –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s the trouble. I am. Being shrunk…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You may learn to like it.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: For a nice young lady, you play with the
damndest toys, Miss Peterson…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: That’ll teach you where to keep your hand.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Now I know…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That could be quite a lethal weapon… It could
kill, not cure.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Not in the hands of a great surgeon like
Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a
millimeter.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I understand you’ve been Dr. Duval’s
Assistant for quite some time… He must’ve snatched you out of the
cradle.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I’ve been with him since I got out of school.
He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: A long time, with one man.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Not working for someone like Dr. Duval –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: ‘Prepare for Miniaturization’…</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Positions, please. And strap yourselves
in.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: It’s all right – I can manage.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Yes, Cora.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I – I want to say…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: What is it? Anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I just wanted to thank you for taking me
along.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Thank you for volunteering.</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Okay, Mr. Grant. Tell them we’re
ready.</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: ‘Proteus reports all
secured.’</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Miniaturizer…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: All stations stand by…</p>
<p><strong>110a- cuts of technicians in main ops room</strong>: 110D Now
all are mobile, waiting at their machines.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Commence Miniaturization.</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Commence Miniaturization.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Elevate Zero Module.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Okay to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Phase Two.</p>
<p><strong>142- <out></strong>: 143</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: We’ve got to submerge manually. Grant, open
Valves One and Two on the bulkhead.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Here – I’ll get the other.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Close valves.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Valves closed.</p>
<p><strong>owens’voice</strong>: Right. That’s all for the present.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Doctor, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I can’t breathe!… I’ve got to get out!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: It’s too late now. We must go on.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’ll feel better once we’re underway.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I – I’m sorry… Claustrophia – buried alive
– two days – air raid – England… Thought I’d gotten over it. Please –
forgive me… I’m quite all right now…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Phase Three.</p>
<p><strong>garter</strong>: Inform Proteus they are at Full
Reduction.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Proteus On-Power.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s all yours, Don.</p>
<p><strong>reid’s voice</strong>: Phase Four.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Contact Proteus –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Stand by for injection!</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Tracking.</p>
<p><strong>197- <out></strong>: 198</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: You may unfasten your belts…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: The Medieval Philosophers were right… <Man>
is the center of the Universe… We stand in the middle of Infinity,
between Outer and Inner Space. And there’s no limit to either.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You mean Inner Space is endless?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Everything can be divided in half, no matter
how minute.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I never…never imagined it could be
anything…like this.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I always thought it was nothing but red.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Only to the naked eye. Those corpuscles –
carrying oxygen – give the stream its color. But the rest of the
plasma’s very much like sea water. An ocean of life…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Quite a piece of plumbing.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: End-to-end, a hundred thousand miles
long.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Dr. Duval – what could those be?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Never saw <that>. Not even under an
electron-mrcroscope.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: They’re much smaller than bacteria…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Looks like the molecular structure of
proteins.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I don’t agree. I think we ought to stop and
take a sample.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: That’s not the purpose of this mission.
Captain – keep a straight course – until you’re in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Arterial Wall to the right!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: What’s our speed?</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Fifteen knots.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: We should reach the Branching Artery in
two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Keep the Wall at its present
distance when you turn. That’ll bring you safely into the middle of the
Branch.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Captain – correct your course – and
speed.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: She won’t respond! We’re in some sort of
current!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: But that isn’t possible.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.
Captain – something must be wrong with your controls!</p>
<p><strong>owens’voice</strong>: No – it’s a current! It’s too strong –
I can’t break out of it!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Whirlpool!… Strap yourselves in!</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Proteus Off Course, sir.
They’ve picked up a blip in Quadrant 23, Level B. Reid moves quickly to
the window overlooking the Main Operations Room, followed by Carter.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: They’ve crossed over into the Jugular
Vein!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That can’t be – there’s no direct connection
between the two –</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Normally not. Unless it’s an Arterio-Venous
Fistula –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: A forced joining of an Artery and Vein.
Must’ve happened when Benes was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the
X-rays.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: But big enough for us…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Captain – head back into the Artery.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: We could never fight that current it’s
physically impossible.</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Then don’t drift down further.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: If we can’t go back, is there an alternate
route?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes… We can go forward on this course, but
it means going directly through the Heart.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: We can’t do that! We decided in the Briefing
– the craft could never stand the turbulence!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes, it would be a hundred times worse
than the whirlpool.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s just dandy. We can’t go forward – and
we can’t go back.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I’m afraid there’s only one thing we can
do. Call off the mission.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Doctor…you can’t mean that! Not when we’ve
come this far. And if we give up, there’ll be no way of saving Mr. Benes
–</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Tell them to take us out.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: If there’s any chance –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Request removal, Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: But we have no choice! We’ve got, to take them
out!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them
in.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: But it’s hopeless! They can’t go back and they
can’t go on. I tell you there’s nothing else we can do but remove
them!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Not until the very last second. We must
think of something… Something to save the situation.</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Proteus reports trapped in
Venous System. Requests removal, sir.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Well, there it is… What do I tell them,
General?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Doctor…without killing him – how long could
we stop his heart?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: The less time, the better.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I know that. But what’s the maximum?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: In his comatose state…and everything slowed
down…no more than sixty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: At topspeed…and adjusting distance for
Degree of Miniaturization – The sub should get through the Heart in
fifty-seven seconds.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: That would give us only three seconds to
revive him…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What are the problems in stopping the
Heart?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Nothing – compared to starting it up
again.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: We’re wasting time, Colonel. Let’s get on
with it.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Heart.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: <Cardiac Red Alert> we’re stopping the
Heart.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Message to Proteus.</p>
<p><strong>carter reid</strong>: You are heading in the An

<p><strong>grant</strong>: – at which point the Heart will be stopped by
electric shock.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: And if it should take more time to get through
–</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: We can’t take a second more.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Captain – head in the d1rection of the
flow and drift with it.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: I’ll never find my way through that.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I’ll guide you, once we’re in the
Heart.</p>
<p><strong>257- <out></strong>: 260</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Ready for Cardiac Shock…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Listen…the Heart.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes…slowed down agreat deal.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sounds like heavy artillery…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: It lays down quite a barrage in a
lifetime. Forty million beats.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: And every beat separates a man from</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Captain! They’ll stop it on the next
beat!</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: As soon as the Valve opens again,
go through and give it everything you’ve got!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Twenty-four seconds left including the three
to revive him.</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Nineteen seconds, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: The Semi-Lunar Valve should be on our left
any time now.</p>
<p><strong>293- <out></strong>: 294</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Fasten yourselves in. There should be a
tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: If it does…</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Eight seconds left –</p>
<p><strong>heart specialist</strong>: Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>311- <out></strong>: 312</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Proteus in Quadrant 161 Level
E…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: They’re in the Pulmonary Artery.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: They’ll make up some time, once they get
through that and reach the Pleural Cavity. Respiration Post…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: What’s his rate, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>lung specialist</strong>: Back to six per minute.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Damn. And I just had them cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>321- <out></strong>: 322</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’d hate to get lost on that Freeway…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: They all lead to the same place – the
Lungs.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Doctor – the channel’s getting awful
narrow.</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: We’re entering a Capillary. Remain
in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: The Wall’s transparent…</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: It’s less than one ten-thousandth
of an inch thick. And porous.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Look at that…they’re changing color…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Doctor – is it possible? That we’re seeing it
happen before our eyes?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Yes, Cora… We’re the very first to see the
<living> process.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Mind letting me in on what’s going on out
there?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles
releasing carbon dioxide – the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung –
in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Don’t tell me they’re refueling…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Oxygenation…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: We’ve known it exists – even though we never
saw it…like the structure of the Atom… But to actually behold one of the
miracles of the Universe – the engineering of the Cycle of a Breath…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Nothing miraculous about it. Just an
interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of
Evolution.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: You can’t believe all that’s accidental? That
there isn’t a Creative Intelligence at work –</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What is it, Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: We’re losing pressure in the Flotation
Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The left tank’s losing pressure.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Grant! Get up here, quick!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Air bubbles!… Doctor –</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: No danger of an embolism. At our reduced
scale, they’re much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: There’s a short in the valve. Take over.
Steers like an airplane.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Well, that takes care of the valve. It was
probably caused by that electric shock.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Was there any damage?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Not to the valve. But we’ve lost too much air
to make it the rest of the way.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: What do you propose we do, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Nothing we can do. We must have full tanks to
continue.</p>
<p><strong>337- <out></strong>: 338</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Any reserve air?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Enough to breathe, but that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber
– one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung – and we can’t get enough to
fill a microscopic tank.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Maybe we can… Skipper, is there a snorkel on
this sub?</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Yes, there is.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Could I run a tube through that Wall, without
harming Benes?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: At this size, I would certainly think
so.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: If those Corpuscles can take on air, no
reason why we can’t. All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that
air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should
be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank. How’s that
sound to you, Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: It’s a dangerous procedure. If I miss the
timing, we could explode the tanks… But I’m willing to try it.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes, by all means. We must try it.</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: It’ll be safer if everybody leaves the
sub.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Cora!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Looks like you didn’t batten it down too
well.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: But I did. I’m positive!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Then how come it worked loose?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Cora, is something wrong with the laser?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I don’t know yet, Doctor. And I won’t know
until I test it.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’ll have to wait until after we’re
refueled.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I can’t imagine how it possibly could have
come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: It must have been jarred loose during the
whirlpool.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, let’s get into these as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: They’ve stopped – on the outer limits of the
Right Lung…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Another delay… With only forty-two minutes
left.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: It’ll be close – but there’s still a margin of
safety.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Let’s find what the devil’s holding them up!
Contact the Proteus!</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: It must be some kind of mechanical
difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: I told you to cut down on the sugar.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I can’t help it. I’m just weak, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>347- <out></strong>: 349</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Shouldn’t you answer that?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Not now. We need air, not greetings!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Let’s go, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It’s full of rocks!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: In a way – yes. Those are impurities
imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of ‘Civilization.’ Carbon from
smoke and smog – specks of dust –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, we better get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Careful! There is a tremendous air
pressure in there – in relation to our size!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’ll try to hold it from the other side of
the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You can’t –it’s too dangerous –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes – with all that pressure, and suction
within –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: There’s no other way. Tie my safety line to
the sub.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Here, let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: All right now – push the snorkel through as
soon as I get inside.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Walt for the lull – between the time he
inhales and exhales.</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Full!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: He’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Nothing – against all that force.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: But we just can’t leave him in there! What’ll
happen to him?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: We’ll know – in the next breath…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: ‘Proteus reports putting in to refuel air.
Proceeding through the Pleural Cavity.’ Refuel air?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Why not? They had a choice of over a billion
Alveoli…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: And a broken trigger-wire…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: A smashed transistor. No way to fire the
lamp… Well, that’s the end of the laser.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You must carry spare parts –</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Not anything built into the chassis. If it
hadn’t come loose –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: That’s beside the point now. I don’t see
the sense of going on.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: We must!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: With no laser –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Isn’t there another surgical procedure you
can try?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: No, there’s no other way.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: If you had a transistor about this size and
power output, and a thin enough wire – – could you piece it
together?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: No, it requires such absolute precision –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: A surgeon might…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Oh yes, I’m sure Dr. Duval could. If we had
the parts.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’ve got a source. All I have to do is tap
it.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Grant – wait a minute – you’re not going
to dismantle the wireless?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Just one little transistor and a circuit wire
is all it takes.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: But that’ll knock out our communications!
We’ll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: They’ll still be able to track us by radar,
because of the radioactive fuel.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or
Benes’ life?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Send the following message…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: ‘Cannibalizing wireless to repair laser.
This is last message.’</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Incommunicado… Now they’re really on their
own.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: We can still track them – but that’s all we
can do.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Something told me I got into the wrong end
of the bus1ness. <Inner> Space…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Nothing closer.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I may be able to scrape it thin enough. Cora,
get me a number eleven scalpel.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Looks like the sea, at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: We’re safe – long as it remains that
color… We’re in the Pleural Sac. It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against
the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we
wind up with Pleurisy – and a wracking cough.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just
<breathing> –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: His Pleura’s in fine condition. It should
be clear sailing through this area.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Let’s hope… So far, somebody’s tried to
sabotage this mission twice.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Sabotage? I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I saw the laser just before we started. It
was fastened down securely. You don’t suppose what happened was an
‘accident?’ Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off
to the sub?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: You have no right to blame Duval –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That line was tampered with…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I – I don’t know what to say. I know he’s
under a cloud, but there’s not a more dedicated man in the entire
medical profession.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You still never know what’s going on in
anyone’s mind…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I can’t believe it. Whatever happened was
an accident.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Two in a row?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: It’s possible –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Thirty-two minutes left… But chances are we
won’t have to wait that long for try-number three.</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Look at those Walls up ahead!</p>
<p><strong>grant’s voice</strong>: <Poached eggs>?!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: We’re entering the Lymphatic System. Those
are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I always had an idea there was only one
System. The Circulatory.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: The Lymphatic System drains off excess
fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we’d all swell up like balloons. He
reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Looks like quite a Navigation problem…</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Only until we get through the Nodes
– the Lymphatic Glands. Follow your present compass heading.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Skipper, you’re picking up seaweed – or
whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of
them soon.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: I hope so, Doctor. If that stuff clogs the
vents, the engine’ll overheat –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Doctor –</p>
<p><strong>407 ext. lymphatic node - beginning of battle between
bacteria and</strong>: ANTIBODIES - P.O.V. PRINCIPALS</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: What’s causing all that – ?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Looks like somebody declared war.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying
Bacteria – or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.</p>
<p><strong>cora’s voice</strong>: Look – it’s taking its exact
shape!</p>
<p><strong>grant’s voice</strong>: Like hand-in-glove.</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Much closer. Like two atoms.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: We’ll never get there in time, at this
rate.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Isn’t there another route? So we can by-pass
all this?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Yes… We can transfer over to the Inner Ear,
and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Then why not take it?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: It’s infinitely more hazardous than going
this way. Once we enter the Inner Ear, <any> sound in the Operating Room
will be disastrous. At our reduced size, the vibrations inside the Ear
would have a shattering effect.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: They’re tracking us Topside. Once they see
where we’re going, I’m sure they’ll take every precaution.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Let’s hope they realize the danger.
Captain, I’ll give you a new compass heading.</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Proteus turning in Quadrant
73.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: At last they’re heading for the Inner Ear…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: About time they realized they’d never make
it the other way.</p>
<p><strong>reid’s voice</strong>: The Proteus is about to enter the
Inner Ear… You are not to walk, talk, or make a sound of <any> kind.
<Absolute silence> must be maintained until they are out of the danger
area…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What’s wrong, Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: What I was afraid would happen. The
stuff we passed through – that looked like seaweed –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Reticular fibers –</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: It clogged the intake vents. We’re not
getting any propulsion.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, there’s only one thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You’re going out there? With those Antibodies
–</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: No danger of attack, as long as you don’t
trigger them off by any injury to the System.</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: How’s it look?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I could use a lawnmower…</p>
<p><strong>418- <out></strong>: 455</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: How long do you think it’ll take?</p>
<p><strong>grant’s voice</strong>: Quite a while.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Wouldn’t it be quicker if we all helped?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes, there’s no time to spare. And those
fibers can be quite tenacious.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I’d better use the time to finish repairing
the laser.</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Report no movement of the
Proteus since entering Quadrant 74, Level D.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Twenty-four minutes left. Maximum. This is
just what we need – another delay…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: You’ll wind up a Hindu. Respecting all forms
of life – however small…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>cora’s voice</strong>: Please! Help!</p>
<p><strong>grant’s voice</strong>: Cora! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I don’t know! I think I’m caught on some
auditory fibers!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Where would that be?</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Right down there.</p>
<p><strong>grant’s voice</strong>: Okay! I can see you!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Antibodies!… Coming at Cora! She’s
triggered them off!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Doctor! Get back in the sub! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Where are they?!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Below the Cells of Hensen. If those
Antibodies reach her, they’ll attack as if she were bacteria…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Hurry! Oh please, please!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Open it! Open it before they get here!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I can’t till the hatch is flooded!</p>
<p><strong>518- <out></strong>: 520</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: They’re tightening…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: How much longer?!</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Ten seconds –</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: That’s too long!</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Please – I – can’t – can’t breathe…</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Proteus proceeding toward
Quadrant 75…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: On their way again…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Twelve minutes left – Of all the time to run
out of sugar…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Looks like quite a way to go…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: No, we should reach the base of the Brain
shortly. And from there, it’s not far to the site of the injury.</p>
<p><strong>grant’s voice</strong>: Where’s that light coming from?</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: The outside world. Filtering in
through Benes’ Eardrum…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: That puts us right here… Which means we can
head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: If we can go in past the Oculomotor
Nerve…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: No need to get up –</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: I feel much better now…</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: The outside world… I thought I’d never see it
again.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Thank you for saving my life.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s what they pay me for.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: A great deal more than that, I believe…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What gives you that idea?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: That’s why you’re really here. I knew it from
the start.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: As obvious as that? Our Security people will
jump for joy. I suppose Duval’s onto me, too?</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: You’re not the first, but he’s much too
innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what’s going on
around him.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Under a cloud without cause, I take it.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won’t follow the
herd, or change his convictions – even when they’re not popular. And he
believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between
scientists of different countries – and these days, there’s nothing more
suspicious than that.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Depends on which end of the telescope you
look through.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, if you happen to be very fond of him –
even in love with him – it would certainly affect your point of
view.</p>
<p><strong>duval’s voice</strong>: It’s out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Now be reasonable!</p>
<p><strong>duval’s voice</strong>: I won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sounds like trouble…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: It’s against my better Judgment…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual
operation – when it may be too late?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I’ve done all I could with the laser.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: All I’m asking is you test it
beforehand!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: If it won’t work, it’s beyond my power to fix
it. But if it does, there’s no telling how long it will hold up. It’s a
jury rig, at best, and we’ll need every second of use we can get out of
it. That’s why I don’t want to put any extra strain on the connections
by running unnecessary tests.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Dr. Duvall I insist you test the
laser.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I’ll do nothing of the sort! The operation is
<my> responsibility! I won’t do it, and that’s final!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: As usual, you want everything your way.
Except this time there’s more than your damned ego at stake.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I know only too well what’s in the balance,
Doctor. And it’s not my ego, damned or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>communications aide</strong>: Proteus turning into Quadrant
791 Level F.</p>
<p><strong>reid’s voice</strong>: The Proteus has passed the Inner
Ear.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: – Just in time! I couldn’t hold it back
another second! – I was afraid to <breathe>! – My foot’s asleep. – Only
one? – I thought I’d die when the scissors hit the floor!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Only eight minutes left…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Imagine – they’re in the Human Mind –</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: “Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of
the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought –”</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: “Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad
Mind of Man…”</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Very poetic, gentlemen. You seem to see a
great deal out there. Let me know when we pass the Soul.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend
Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Take a close look at your Soul, and your
Infinity, and your God out there –</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: – and you’ll find it’s nothing but
a combination of atoms, molecules –</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: –and certain chemicals involving proteins
–</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: You left something out.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: The Breath of God…</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Doctor – what’s that up ahead?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: There it is. That’s the site of the injury –
the dark spot. We’d better get prepared.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: It’s too late…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: You couldn’t possibly operate and get out
before the hour’s up. Captain, keep going. Head for the Removal
Point.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Removal Point? What’re you talking about!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: We have no alternative. With only six
minutes left, we’ll just barely make it.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hold it, Skipper. What happens if we
overstay?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Once time’s up, De-Miniaturization begins.
In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger
to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they
would any invader.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How long will it take to get from here to the
Removal Point?</p>
<p><strong>owens’voice</strong>: Approximately two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: That still leaves me four minutes to
operate.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: All you’ll succeed in doing is getting us
trapped! Captain, you will proceed immediately to the Removal Point.</p>
<p><strong>owens’ voice</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: My power’s gone! Grant – what’re you
doing!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Get the laser, Dr. Duval.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I’m in charge of this mission! You were
instructed to take orders from me, not give them!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sorry, but the situation has changed.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Nothing has changed as far as <my>
authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we
have left! There’s no chance of success! It’s sheer suicide for all of
us!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Dr. Duval, you are not going through with
this! I absolutely forbid it! I’m responsible for the lives of everyone
here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I’m going to do what I can to save Benes.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: You fool! Don’t you see what you’ve done?
You’ve given him a perfect opportunity to kill Benes!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I don’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Why not? Because of his gibberish about
GOd and the Soul? Camouflage – that’s all it is – to blind the gullible
like you! And to hide his real identity – a fanatic whose only purpose
is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’ve come up against fanatics before, and
Duval just doesn’t fit the pattern. I’m going out there, Skipper. Maybe
I can be of some help…</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Remember – we can’t take more than five
minutes to get out.</p>
<p><strong>552- <out></strong>: 553</p>
<p><strong>556- <out></strong>: 557</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How does it look, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: If I can relieve the pressure on a few key
vessels…</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Skipper…</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: There seems to be something wrong
with the Escape Hatch…</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Fluid is seeping through. Better
come down and have a look!</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: I don’t see any sign of –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Doctor, we’ve just about had it.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may>
be enough…</p>
<p><strong>566- <out></strong>: 567</p>
<p><strong>570- <out></strong>: 571</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: That should be enough…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We better get back to the sub. Every second
counts now.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: Look! They follow the direction of her glance,
are startled to see:</p>
<p><strong>cora’s voice</strong>: It’s heading right for the Nerve!</p>
<p><strong>duval’s voice</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The laser! Let me have the laser!</p>
<p><strong>577- <out></strong>: 589</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Give me your widest beam! Full power!</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Time’s up… We’ll have to take them out
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It means killing Benes… And for all we know,
they may have completed the operation! Damn it to hell!</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Remove the Proteus…</p>
<p><strong>chief surgeon</strong>: Prepare for trepanation…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The ship’s good as finished. We’ll have to
get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner
of the Eye.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: It’s beginning to grow…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: We’ve got to get them out.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hold it…</p>
<p><strong>cora’s voice</strong>: White Corpuscles!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: They’ll ingest the ship and everything in
it!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Stay here, both of you. Hold them off, if you
can.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Grant! Help!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Dr. Michaels… He went berserk…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Berserk nothing. He’s the one who’s been
sabotaging the mission… Get this on. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>michaels’ voice</strong>: Grant!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Macrophages!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Get me out of here. Get me out!!</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: No…no…</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Come on – it’s no use!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We can get out through the Lab Section.</p>
<p><strong>602b- <out></strong>: 602D</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You said there was a quick way out!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: What about Dr. Michaels?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>604- <out></strong>: 606</p>
<p><strong>608- <out></strong>: 616</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hold it, Doctor!</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That blip we’re picking up might only be the
radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: What’re you getting at?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: If I were in their place and I’d run out of
time, I’d abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size… and use the
few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own…</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.</p>
<p><strong>reid’s voice</strong>: Wait thirty seconds…</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: Light impulses – on the way to the Brain!
We’re nearing the Eye!</p>
<p><strong>623- <out></strong>: 628</p>
<p><strong>632- <out></strong>: 639</p>
<p><strong>643- <out></strong>: 645</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: A glass slide! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Open those doors!</p>
<p><strong>654a- <out></strong>: 658</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hello, Mr. Benes… How’s the prize
patient?</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: He’s making a fine recovery.</p>
<p><strong>cora</strong>: He certainly is. He should be up and about in
no time.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can’t
remember what he came to tell us.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Can’t remember?… What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He’s blanked out on that one particular
point.</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: Yes, he can remember everything – except how
to control De- Miniaturization…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: After all that.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: A specific area of memory may have been
destroyed by the laser beam when Dr. Michaels interfered.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: As long as it isn’t a certainty, we’ve got
to try everything possible to make him remember!</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Well, if you have no further need for me…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Yes, we’d like to get moving.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Why don’t you go on. We’ll meet you at the
Clearance Desk in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Good-bye, Mr. Benes. I must say it’s been
quite an experience knowing you.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Now how soon can we try Sodium
Pentathol?</p>
<p><strong>reid</strong>: I’d hold that off awhile.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Well, how about hypnosis? That can’t hurt
him!</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: I suggest the first thing we try is letting
the patient get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>duval</strong>: He may have a head injury! Get him to the
hospital!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Who, me? Oh, no! Don’t bother about me! We’re
not hurt! Isn’t that right, Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Uh – what?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We feel great, don’t we? Just <great>?!</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Oh – sure, sure! Never better!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We’re
fine – just fine!</p>
