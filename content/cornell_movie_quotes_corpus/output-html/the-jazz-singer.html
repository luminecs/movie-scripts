<h1 id="the-jazz-singer">the-jazz-singer</h1>
<p><strong>1. ext. new york street long shot</strong>: It is a typical
East Side business street at the height of the day’s activities, a
street that is lined with pushcarts, sidewalk vendors and little stores,
with its milling shoppers, its petty marketing arguments, its unkempt
kids playing in the street heedless of consequences. In the distance is
seen an elevated train flashing across the background like a comet
across the sky.</p>
<p><strong>2. moving shot same</strong>: A shot may be made from an auto
or truck down the street showing the teeming life of the ghetto. As the
camera reaches a street intersection, a half dozen kids come into the
scene.</p>
<p><strong>3. med. shot kids</strong>: They are playing tag on the
intersecting street which is given over to tenements. There are no
pushcarts and only a few stores in the basements or ground floors of the
buildings which house many thousands of ghetto folk. The kids are
attracted to something. They all look down the street and then start
running in the direction they have been looking. Some little girls join
them.</p>
<p><strong>4. ext. side street med. shot</strong>: In front of a low
brick building is an Italian with a street piano and he is grinding out
that always popular classic of the East Side, “The Sidewalks of New
York.” The kids come into the scene and gather around the
hurdy-gurdy.</p>
<p><strong>5. close-up group</strong>: The Italian smiles as the
children start dancing about. He looks expectantly at the windows above
him and nods pleasantly to someone up above as he continues cranking the
piano.</p>
<p><strong>6. ext. tenements long shot</strong>: Looking upward from the
street piano. This may be a very effective shot. In several of the
windows women are looking down at the music-maker and other heads appear
in other windows. Several take deliberate aim and toss coins to the
street.</p>
<p><strong>7. close-up italian</strong>: He holds out his ragged cap and
expertly catches several coins without once taking his hand from the
crank of the street piano. The piece ends. He pulls a little lever and
starts turning on another selection – some old operatic favorite like
the “Intermezzo” from Cavalleria Rusticana. He starts moving down the
street as he plays.</p>
<p><strong>8. tenement street long shot</strong>: As the street piano,
still in operation, goes down the street, the group of kids, now much
larger, follows along. The Italian stops in front of another building,
which adjoins the Orchard Street synagogue.</p>
<p><strong>9. close shot front synagogue</strong>: It bears the name, in
Hebrew, of the temple. Several children get up on the steps in front of
the closed doors to listen to the music, which is approaching. Next door
is an old brownstone front, before which the Italian stops. Underneath
is a store, and in the flat over the store live Cantor Rabinowitz and
his family.</p>
<p><strong>10. int. room in synagogue</strong>: Full shot of the little
anteroom in which the rabbi holds school for the children of the
congregation and in which the cantor teaches the boys of the choir the
songs and chants of the orthodox – the prayers set to music that has
been handed down for generations. Several boys are seated on a bench
beside a battered old square piano . The sound of the street piano comes
through the open window, and the kids rush to the window. They no sooner
get to it and climb up to look out when the door into the room from the
synagogue proper slowly opens and the head of the venerable Cantor
Rabinowitz appears.</p>
<p><strong>11. close-up cantor</strong>: He peers into the room to see
if his class is ready for him. He has some difficulty in finding them.
Finally he discovers them at the window. He lifts his head as he hears
the strains from the street piano, and a look of disgust comes to him.
He closes the door behind him and starts in with a determined look.</p>
<p><strong>11a. reverse shot boys</strong>: They are packed in the
window, patched pants seats and legs only being visible.</p>
<p><strong>12. ext. med. shot</strong>: The Italian is now in front of
the synagogue and is grinding out another tune while the children dance
about the discordant instrument.</p>
<p><strong>13. int. school room med. shot</strong>: The four or five
boys are jammed into the open window, some of them half way out with
feet sticking almost straight out backward. With determined tread the
cantor comes up behind them and starts yanking them out of the window.
They are badly frightened and duck as the cantor cuffs them right and
left.</p>
<p><strong>14. full shot room</strong>: The boys, some of them propelled
from behind by the irate cantor, scramble for their seats. The cantor
starts to come after them, then the strains of the music assault his
delicate ear and he turns instead to the window.</p>
<p><strong>15. close-up cantor</strong>: He takes hold of the window and
yanks it down roughly as though he cannot shut out the sound from
without quickly enough. Then he turns and faces the boys. He looks them
over, muttering to himself imprecations on the terrible sounds from
without – an insult to his musically attuned ear.</p>
<p><strong>16. med. shot boys and cantor</strong>: The boys straighten
up with solemn looks on their faces as the cantor looks them over
scowlingly.</p>
<p><strong>17. ext. street outside temple long shot</strong>: The
Italian and his piano are disappearing in the distance, and a group of
boys are playing ball in the street. One is batting.</p>
<p><strong>18. int. cantor close-up</strong>: He is looking at the boys
as he says:</p>
<p><strong>19. full shot room</strong>: The cantor is in the foreground
addressing the boys. As he finishes the question one of the boys starts
to answer it. The old man suddenly jumps around and looks up in back of
him.</p>
<p><strong>20. close-up window</strong>: There is a big round hole in
the window.</p>
<p><strong>21. close-up cantor</strong>: He looks down at the glass on
the floor, then stoops and picks up a ball from the floor. He shakes his
head ominously. He scowls at the kids, then looks toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>22. close-up at door</strong>: It is opening cautiously and
the black curly head of a boy of about thirteen appears. He enters
hesitatingly and fearfully of the possible consequences.</p>
<p><strong>23. full shot room</strong>: The kids all look from father to
son expectantly, each hoping that Jakie will get a licking as soon as
possible. The cantor comes toward the boy, his brows knitted in a deep
frown. Jakie starts toward his father repeating, “I couldn’t help it – I
didn’t mean to hit it so hard – honest I didn’t.” They meet in the
center of the room, the boy still protesting half tearfully. The old man
brings back his arm as though to strike him.</p>
<p><strong>24. close shot both</strong>: As the cantor brings back his
arm, Jakie shuts his eyes and ducks, but the cantor reconsiders and
brings the hand down alongside without striking the boy. He waves him to
his seat on the bench with a half- uttered threat to “fix him good the
next time.”</p>
<p><strong>25. full shot room</strong>: The cantor turns from Jakie with
an impatient gesture and lines the boys up for their lesson. He calls
them to attention, then tells them to listen to what he is going to
sing. He walks to the piano and poises a hand over the keys.</p>
<p><strong>26. close-up cantor</strong>: He strikes a note to give him
the key he wants but the piano is evidently out of tune. He shakes his
head disgustedly, then takes an old-fashioned tuning fork out of his
inside coat pocket and strikes it on the side of the piano, then holds
it to his ear. He sings the note and then indicates to the boys that
they are to follow him as he sings.</p>
<p><strong>27. med. shot cantor and boys</strong>: The cantor is singing
and one of the boys is paying no attention. He is looking around toward
the window longingly. The cantor, still singing, walks over to him and
cuffs him on the ear.</p>
<p><strong>28. close-up cantor and boy</strong>: The boy ducks a second
swipe. The cantor glares at him and demands that he give his undivided
attention to the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>29. close shot other boys</strong>: They are singing but
taking in the scene on the side. They grin at each other in joy at their
companion’s trouble, then they quickly turn their eyes forward and sing
more lustily as they feel the cantor’s eyes on them.</p>
<p><strong>30. full shot room</strong>: The cantor takes his place
again. He shows his disgust with the manner in which the boys are
singing and, with an impatient gesture, he stops and tells them to go
home.</p>
<p><strong>31. close-up cantor</strong>: He waves them away, saying:</p>
<p><strong>32. med. shot group</strong>: The cantor finishes his
dismissal and as the boys, including Jakie, start for the door, he stops
his son. Jakie, with a crestfallen look, follows with his eyes the
disappearing figures of his playmates, who quickly exit. His father
calls him and he comes opposite him and looks up rather sullenly for the
scolding he expects.</p>
<p><strong>33. close-up cantor and son</strong>: The cantor looks down
at Jakie with a scowl and starts berating him. He points to the window
and his anger again rises. Jakie starts backing away as though expecting
violence. The old man gets himself together and his attitude changes
from anger to sadness. He says to the boy:</p>
<p><strong>34. close-up boy</strong>: He swallows a few times, then
looking up at his father courageously, he declares:</p>
<p><strong>35. close-up cantor</strong>: He looks at the boy in
amazement, his hands going aloft in horror. It is difficult for him to
speak. Finally he breaks out:</p>
<p><strong>36. close-up father and son</strong>: The father makes as
though to strike the boy, who this time stands his ground bravely. The
hand of the aged man is raised for the blow, but he halts it in mid air.
The father looks down into the eyes of the boy, which are fixed
steadfastly on him. He shakes his head sorrowfully.</p>
<p><strong>37. int. muller’s cafe</strong>: Long shot discloses one of
those places so common in New York before Prohibition, a long bar in
front, and behind, separated from the bar by a partition and swinging
doors, a “garden” approachable from the “family entrance” where “ladies”
may dine and drink their beer, whether with escorts or without them. The
back of the place can be seen faintly. The bar is being well patronized,
and the three German bartenders are busy putting out huge schooners of
the amber fluid. Waiters are going in and out of the swinging doors.</p>
<p><strong>38. int. garden full shot</strong>: Looking toward the bar,
there is a battered old piano in the foreground on a slightly raised
platform, at which sits a young man who looks twice his age because of
dissipation. He is smoking a cigarette in a listless manner, and there
is a schooner of beer on the piano at the end of the keyboard. He is
running his hands over the keys as though playing to himself. Back of
him may be seen the diners and drinkers. There is an occasional family
group and several of the tables are occupied by flashily dressed women
of an obviously well-known occupation. Some are accompanied by men. At
other tables are men alone quietly drinking.</p>
<p><strong>39. close-up family entrance</strong>: Seen from the inside,
the door opens slowly and the head of Jakie Rabinowitz appears. He looks
about as though to see if the coast is clear, then enters. His attitude
indicates that he has been there before.</p>
<p><strong>40. full shot garden</strong>: Jakie threads his way among
the tables to the piano. Several of the drinkers look at him as they
recognize the boy, and there is some conversation about him among the
groups. Jakie calls to the piano player, who swings around to greet him,
as he gets on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>41. close shot flayer and jakie</strong>: The pianist greets
Jakie jocularly:</p>
<p><strong>42. full shot garden</strong>: Those at the tables look
toward the piano with interest as Jakie, in the background, is seen
standing on the little platform facing them.</p>
<p><strong>43. med. shot boy and piano player</strong>: The player plays
the introduction to “Mighty Lak a Rose” and the boy starts to sing.
Vitaphone singing stops, when cut is made.</p>
<p><strong>44. int. rabinowitz living room</strong>: It is a rather
large room for that locality, the living room and dining room of the
modest flat occupied by the cantor and his family. The furniture is good
but old, and there are many shelves and tables which are filled with
knickknacks, china, glassware, and silver. Mrs. Rabinowitz, a
sweet-faced, motherly woman of between forty-five and fifty, is just
setting the table. It is the day of the eve of Atonement Day, the most
important holiday of Judaism, which is observed by even the least
religious of Jews, by twenty-four hours of abstinence from food or
drink. The cantor is pacing up and down the room in a very nervous
manner. He pauses occasionally to make a quick remark, punctuated by an
elaborate gesture, then resumes his pacing. The subject of his remarks
is Jakie.</p>
<p><strong>45. close-up mother</strong>: She is setting plates on the
table as she listens to the cantor. She hesitates, then says:</p>
<p><strong>46. med. shot both</strong>: As Sara finishes title and
resumes her work, the cantor stops and looks at her in amazement. He
starts to say: “What, not a cantor, you say that?” Then he takes a long
breath and, bringing his fist down through the air, he breaks out into a
stream of Yiddish.</p>
<p><strong>47. close-up cantor</strong>: He declares violently that
Jakie must be a cantor, just like himself and his fathers before him. He
leans closer to his wife as he says, with some semblance of pride:</p>
<p><strong>48. close-up sara</strong>: She nods her head in acquiescence
of what her husband has said; then she shakes her head slowly and
replies:</p>
<p><strong>49. close shot both</strong>: As she finishes the old man
looks at her in horror. This which she has said is, to him, treason. She
turns her back as he begins to scold breathlessly.</p>
<p><strong>50. full shot cafe from front end of bar</strong>: There are
only a few people drinking at the bar in the foreground. The “garden” is
visible as people pass through the swinging doors.</p>
<p><strong>51. full shot garden</strong>: As seen from the doors, Jakie
is singing and the people at the tables are watching and listening
approvingly.</p>
<p><strong>52. med. shot bar</strong>: A tall, spare Hebrew with a
straggly beard and a cutaway coat comes into the foreground. He orders a
glass of beer, putting his nickel on the bar as he does so.</p>
<p><strong>53. close-up yudelson</strong>: He drinks slowly and with
relish.</p>
<p><strong>55. long reverse shot</strong>: Jakie is singing.</p>
<p><strong>56. close-up yudelson</strong>: His lips tighten. He
determines that something must be done about this and he knows just what
it is. He goes quickly to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>57. med. shot bar</strong>: Yudelson gulps down the beer,
crams the rest of the food into his mouth, and exits.</p>
<p><strong>58. int. rabinowitz home</strong>: The cantor is walking up
and down the floor nervously. Sara is putting the dishes of food on the
table. The cantor stops and faces Sara sternly.</p>
<p><strong>59. close-up cantor</strong>: He takes out a huge silver
watch, looks at it, and says:</p>
<p><strong>60. med. shot both</strong>: Sara makes some excuse for the
boy. Maybe he doesn’t know what time it is. He starts pacing up and down
again. Sara finishes the placing of food on the table and starts
arranging the chairs.</p>
<p><strong>61. close-up cantor</strong>: He scowls as he pauses in his
pacing and says:</p>
<p><strong>62. full shot room</strong>: As the cantor resumes his
pacing, Sara hears someone at the door and goes to it, only to admit,
instead of the expected Jakie, an excited Yudelson. The cantor turns
around in surprise. Yudelson rushes up to him and starts telling him
about seeing Jakie singing nigger songs in Muller’s. The cantor throws
up his hands in horror. Yudelson nods grimly but in a satisfied
manner.</p>
<p><strong>63. close-up yudelson</strong>: He says in a self-righteous
manner:</p>
<p><strong>64. full shot room</strong>: The cantor has grabbed his hat
and is on his way out of the door as Yudelson stands open-mouthed. Sara
starts wringing her hands.</p>
<p><strong>65. close shot yudelson and sara</strong>: As they see the
cantor disappear, Sara looks at Yudelson with marked disapproval. He
decides that it is time to go and turns as Sara starts to reprove him
for his tattling. She tells him he would be better off attending to his
own business. With a hurried excuse Yudelson turns.</p>
<p><strong>66. full shot room</strong>: Yudelson quickly disappears out
of the front door and Sara drops into a chair heavily. She knows that
there will be an unpleasant scene before long and she dreads it.</p>
<p><strong>67. int. beer hall full shot</strong>: Jakie is just
finishing a song and those at the tables start applauding. Some of them
throw coins to Jakie.</p>
<p><strong>68. close-up jakie</strong>: His singing manners have gone.
Now he is just business as he starts to pick up the scattered coins. He
picks up the last one and pockets it. Then he turns to the piano
player.</p>
<p><strong>69. close shot both</strong>: They discuss what Jakie is to
sing next. Then the piano player starts a ragtime piece and Jakie starts
to sing in the most approved darkey manner.</p>
<p><strong>70. full shot garden</strong>: The people at the tables are
showing new interest in the singer.</p>
<p><strong>71. close shot family entrance</strong>: The door opens
suddenly and the figure of the irate cantor appears. He pauses and takes
one look, then strides in with great determination.</p>
<p><strong>72. med. shot jakie from front</strong>: He is putting
everything he has into his song. He is rolling his eyes and calling on
“his baby.” His eyes drop and he looks forward just in time to see his
father coming toward him. His voice breaks as the old man comes into the
scene. A determined arm reaches up and grabs him, and the song ends
abruptly.</p>
<p><strong>73. full shot room</strong>: With the boy in a viselike grip,
the cantor starts toward the door with the squirming figure of his young
son. The people at the table are laughing heartily at the unexpected
entertainment. Father and son exit.</p>
<p><strong>74. close-up piano player</strong>: Getting the humor of the
situation, he starts playing something appropriate, like “Stay in Your
Own Backyard” or perhaps something more modern and more to the
point.</p>
<p><strong>75. rabinowitz living room</strong>: Sara is sitting in the
rocking chair, rocking slowly back and forth, occasionally dabbing at
her eyes with a handkerchief. She gets up and goes to the table. She
feels one of the dishes and, seeing that it is cold, she starts with it
to the kitchen. As she returns she looks toward the front door, then
rushes hurriedly in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>76. med. shot front door</strong>: The cantor comes in
breathlessly, pushing the boy ahead of him, just as Sara comes up to
them. The boy tries to go to her but the irate cantor holds him tightly
and motions Sara not to interfere.</p>
<p><strong>77. close shot group</strong>: The cantor glares down at the
boy who starts squirming. He tightens his grip on him as he repeats over
and over: “Singing nigger songs in a beer garden! You bummer! You no
good lowlife!” As Sara tries to intercede, the cantor silences her
almost roughly. As he half pushes her away he says:</p>
<p><strong>78. full shot room</strong>: As father with son in tow go
toward the bedroom, the mother follows a few steps, pleading with the
cantor not to whip Jakie. He turns around and demands what she means by
such interference. She looks at him imploringly.</p>
<p><strong>79. close-up sara</strong>: She holds out her outstretched
hands to the cantor, saying:</p>
<p><strong>80. close shot group</strong>: The cantor answers her with a
snort of disgust and renewed determination to continue with what he
considers his duty. The boy, emboldened by his mother’s championship,
turns and faces his father courageously. The old man looks down at him
in surprise.</p>
<p><strong>81. close-up cantor and son</strong>: The boy looks up at his
father, his boyish face set with determination. He declares:</p>
<p><strong>82. med. shot room</strong>: As the cantor shoves open the
door, Sara again tries to intervene. The cantor holds out a hand to
prevent her following, pushes Jakie into the bedroom, and follows him,
closing the door behind him with a bang. Sara stands looking tearfully
at the door, realizing the expected crisis in the little family, which
she has feared, has finally arrived.</p>
<p><strong>83. close-up sara</strong>: She stands mutely facing the
door. Suddenly she starts and listens, then puts her hands over her ears
as though to shut out the sounds she hears, and her shoulders heave with
repressed sobs. She starts for the door, then restrains herself. Her
emotions finally overcome her and she drops into a chair and cries
without restraint.</p>
<p><strong>84. med. shot same</strong>: The door of the bedroom opens
suddenly and Jakie emerges. He is shaking with a mixture of anger and
the painful effects of the whipping. He comes out quickly, looks at his
mother, rushes over, and kisses her impulsively, and as she puts her
arms around him, he breaks away and before she can stop him, he runs
toward the front door.</p>
<p><strong>85. full shot room</strong>: Jakie rushes to the door and
dashes out, as the cantor appears in the doorway of the bedroom. He is
somewhat breathless from exertion. He does not look to see what has
become of the boy. He pauses and looks at his wife in a dazed way. He
looks toward the door. Then in a mechanical way he takes his watch from
his pocket and glances at it.</p>
<p><strong>86. close-up cantor</strong>: He holds the watch up to his
eyes closely, then looks in the direction of his wife and says:</p>
<p><strong>87. med.shot both</strong>: The cantor starts putting on the
robe, with great deliberation. Sara is standing mutely looking toward
the door through which her boy vanished.</p>
<p><strong>88. int. synagogue long shot</strong>: Every pew in the place
is filled with men, and in the balcony behind sit the women in the place
reserved for them. On the raised platform, the cantor and the choir boys
are taking their places.</p>
<p><strong>89. close shot cantor and choir</strong>: As the boys line
up, a solemn look on each young face, the cantor looks from one to the
other.</p>
<p><strong>90. close-up cantor</strong>: He has his back to the
congregation. He has his eyes fixed on the place where Jakie usually has
stood.</p>
<p><strong>91. med. shot</strong>: As the Cantor stands motionless, the
rabbi steps up to him. The old man looks at him and they exchange a few
words.</p>
<p><strong>92. close shot both</strong>: The cantor looks at the vacant
place again, then turns to the rabbi and says, with a break in his
voice:</p>
<p><strong>93. full shot synagogue</strong>: The congregation comes to
attention, and small groups that have been conversing look toward the
cantor.</p>
<p><strong>94. med. shot choir</strong>: The cantor is in the
foreground, his back to the camera, as the first low notes of the “Kol
Nidre” are sung. Never has the cantor’s voice sung the heart-breaking
song like this before. There is a tear in every note, and as his voice
rises in the wailing harmony that is handed down from the walls of
Jerusalem, the choir boys look at him in wonder.</p>
<p><strong>95. full shot synagogue</strong>: As the cantor’s voice rises
in a long, mournful wail, the scene and music slowly FADE.</p>
<p><strong>96. airplane view of san francisco</strong>: A shot may be
obtained which immediately identifies the city, with its hills and
ferries and the Golden Gate in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>97. office star vaudeville circuit</strong>: Full shot of
room shows various types of performers seated about the room awaiting an
opportunity to talk to the booking manager. There is an old-time
legitimate actor of the East Lynne period, a dancing team of girls,
three Teutonic-looking acrobats, a fat young man whose clothes were once
quite “snappy,” and a few other types found usually in such a place. The
fat man is hidden behind a copy of Variety. An office boy, small,
weazened, and wise beyond his years, pertly tells all inquirers that
Mr. Schuler is “in conference.” All of the people in the room look
hopefully toward the door every time it is opened and look away
hopelessly every time it closes. A big, husky, flashily dressed blonde
enters and breezes up to the boy. He gets up and tries to hold the gate
of the enclosure shut, so that she cannot enter.</p>
<p><strong>98. close-up blonde and boy</strong>: She says that she is
there to see Mr. Schuler. The boy looks at her and says:</p>
<p><strong>99. full shot room</strong>: The less fortunate performers
sit and look wonderingly at the closed door. The boy finally shrugs his
shoulders and takes his chair. The outer door opens and a young man
enters. He is shabbily dressed and, although he is neat of person, it is
obvious that he is down on his luck. He pauses and then hesitatingly
goes up to the railing where the office boy sits idly hammering a
typewriter with no paper in it. The boy doesn’t even look up.</p>
<p><strong>100. close-up jack</strong>: He stands looking at the boy
nervously.</p>
<p><strong>101. close shot both</strong>: The boy just looks up and
snaps out that “it car,’t be done – he’s in an important conf’rence.”
Jack hopelessly turns away and the boy continues his mauling of the
typewriter.</p>
<p><strong>102. full shot room</strong>: As Jack walks disconsolately
over to the one vacant chair, the young man hidden behind the copy of
Variety looks up. He recognizes Jack and, with a smile, he jumps up and
they grab each other’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>103. close-up both</strong>: They exchange the usual
greeting: “If it ain’t my old partner of the sticks, Jack Robin!” and
Jack’s return:</p>
<p><strong>104. full shot room</strong>: As they are talking, the boy
suddenly jumps up as though answering a buzzer and goes to the inner
door. He opens it, listens to something said within, nods, and closes
the door. He walks to the rail and gives the people sitting around the
room a contemptuous look.</p>
<p><strong>105. close-up boy</strong>: He pauses a moment as he feels
the expectant eyes on him, and with the cruelty of youth, he barks out
at them:</p>
<p><strong>106. full shot room</strong>: The occupants start getting up
wearily. They start for the door. Jack and Buster are the last to go.
They pause in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>107. close shot both</strong>: They look at each other and
Jack says to him: “Where to?” Buster pauses and says they can take a
walk and stall around awhile. He adds:</p>
<p><strong>108. ext. street</strong>: In the near foreground looking
down the street is the entrance to the Orpheum theater. The electric
sign in front is lighted. The lighted sign is suddenly extinguished to
indicate that the show is over, and people start coming out of the
doors. This DISSOLVES INTO:</p>
<p><strong>109. int. theater backstage full shot</strong>: The players
who have just finished their act, the closing one on the bill, a troupe
of acrobats, are just going to their dressing rooms. A door to one of
the stage dressing rooms opens, and a girl dressed neatly in street
attire comes halfway out.</p>
<p><strong>110. close-up girl</strong>: She is a small blonde girl,
dressed in excellent taste. She is calling out to someone not in
sight.</p>
<p><strong>111. med. shot girl</strong>: She comes out of the door and
closes it behind her. She calls again, and in the background another
girl and a young man, Ben Thorpe, appear. The girl is a tall,
wise-looking blonde of about twenty-five and the young man is tall,
blond, and good-looking. They come up to Mary and there is some talk as
to where they are going.</p>
<p><strong>112. close shot three</strong>: They argue a while, then Mary
says: “Let’s go over to Coffee Dan’s.” Estelle says that she won’t
remain long. The young man takes each by an arm and they start out.</p>
<p><strong>113. int. coffee dan’s full shot</strong>: The tables are
pretty well filled by a fairly well-dressed crowd. Some even are in
evening clothes. There is a general air of hilarity, but no drinking is
in evidence. Next to a table filled by people in evening clothes, their
women bedecked with diamonds, is a table at which sit several
tough-looking characters. But there are not many of these. Men waiters
dash back and forth carrying mostly ham and eggs, the piece de
resistance of a Coffee Dan meal. At the piano on the platform sits Frank
James, tortoise shell-bespectacled musician and entertainer as well as
master of ceremonies. In the background, up near the platform, is a
small table at which sit Jack Robin and Buster Billings.</p>
<p><strong>114. close-up table</strong>: Jack and Buster are eating
heartily with all the gusto that characterizes a healthy appetite that
has been whetted by lengthy fasting. They look up at Frank and grin
happily.</p>
<p><strong>115. close-up frank</strong>: He looks down at them, gives
them a signal, then walks to the edge of the platform nearest them.</p>
<p><strong>116. full shot room</strong>: Frank is trying to get the
diners to be quiet. The people at the tables gradually hush their noise.
Jack and Buster shove their plates away in complete satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>117. close-up frank</strong>: He has a hand upraised as he
looks over the crowd. Then he casts a look down at Jack’s table and
winks as he starts announcing:</p>
<p><strong>118. close shot table</strong>: Jack is shrinking back in an
embarrassed manner. Buster reaches over and claps him on the back,
telling him to be a good sport, that they all do it there, even the big
ones in grand opera.</p>
<p><strong>119. med. shot tables</strong>: The people at the tables are
looking at Jack and hammering on the tables with their hammers in an
encouraging manner.</p>
<p><strong>120. close-up jack and buster</strong>: Jack dumbly accuses
Buster of framing him, but the latter just laughs. Jack finally pulls
himself together as he realizes that there is no out for him.</p>
<p><strong>121. med. shot table and platform</strong>: As Frank leans
down with hand extended, Jack stands up, straightens his coat, and joins
him. Frank gives him a hand and yanks him up on the platform, where they
go into a conference as to what Jack is to sing.</p>
<p><strong>122. long shot from platform</strong>: Jack and Frank are in
the foreground at the piano talking. In the background, a group appears
at the foot of the stairs just entering the place. It is the group from
the vaudeville theater. Mary is in front, and as the head waiter motions
to them, they enter the place and are seated at a table just in front of
the platform as Frank sits down at the piano and starts playing for
Jack, who has advanced to the edge of the platform.</p>
<p><strong>123. close-up jack</strong>: He starts to sing his song.</p>
<p><strong>124. med. shot from floor</strong>: The table at which Mary
and her party are seated is in the immediate foreground. They are paying
attention only to the waiter who is standing over them awaiting their
orders, as Jack is singing. Mary, attracted by his voice, looks away
from the group wonderingly as she listens.</p>
<p><strong>125. close-up mary</strong>: She is looking up at Jack
curiously as she listens. This is something new to her.</p>
<p><strong>126. close-up jack</strong>: He is singing, his eyes aimed
toward the back of the place. As though feeling the attraction of Mary’s
gaze, his eyes slowly come down. As they meet those of Mary, he gulps
and almost breaks. With an effort, he continues singing, his eyes on the
girl.</p>
<p><strong>127. close shot group at table</strong>: Mary still has her
eyes on the singer. The others of the group, Estelle and Ben Thorpe, are
looking at Jack as they see him looking intently at Mary. They turn to
her and start kidding her about her conquest. She kids them in return
and does not look at Jack again. She is again her usually reserved self,
a girl intensely interested in her work and wrapped up in her
career.</p>
<p><strong>128. med. shot jack</strong>: He is bringing his song to a
close. As he does, Frank gets up quickly and shakes hands with him. Jack
is embarrassed at this and, at Frank’s instigation, he turns and bows to
the audience and jumps down from the platform hurriedly as though in
fear that he would be called on again.</p>
<p><strong>129. full shot room</strong>: The diners are applauding and
pounding on the tables with their hammers. Jack, in the background, is
seen going to his table, where Buster rises and slaps him on the back
and compliments him on his work. The diners are still applauding and
Jack turns and bows to them. Buster tries to get him to go up again but
he shakes his head and sits down at his table.</p>
<p><strong>130. close-up jack and buster</strong>: Buster is still
complimenting Jack, but the latter’s eyes have wandered to the table
occupied by Mary and her companions. Buster follows his gaze. His face
lights up with recognition. Jack notes this and turning to him eagerly
says: “Do you know her?” Buster says: “Which her?” Jack indicates Mary.
Buster nods: “Sure I know her – I’m going over and say Hello.” Jack
starts to follow, then subsides, his eyes on Buster.</p>
<p><strong>131. close shot mary’s table</strong>: Mary is saying to
Thorpe:</p>
<p><strong>132. close-up jack</strong>: He sees the signal and jumps up
eagerly. Then with an effort to slow down in order to hide his eagerness
to meet Mary, he walks slowly over to the table.</p>
<p><strong>133. close shot mary’s table</strong>: Buster is telling them
about Jack, when the latter appears. Buster presents him, and Mary asks
him to sit down in the chair next to her. He does so. Mary turns to him
and asks him something about himself, first congratulating him on his
singing.</p>
<p><strong>134. full shot room</strong>: Frank goes to the piano and
starts a dance number. The couples flock out to the little dancing
space. Thorpe asks Estelle to dance and she gets up. Mary and Jack are
deep in conversation.</p>
<p><strong>135. close shot mary’s table</strong>: As Estelle and her
escort move away in the dance, Buster looks at Jack and starts to say
something. Neither pays any attention to him. He makes a facetious
excuse, then gets up. They never notice him leave.</p>
<p><strong>136. full shot room</strong>: Buster threads his way through
the dancers and climbs up on the platform. He goes over to Frank and
sits down on the stool alongside of him. Frank starts to talk to him
while he is playing.</p>
<p><strong>137. close-up jack and mary</strong>: Jack thanks her for her
approval of his song. Then, after a moment of embarrassment, Jack tells
her that he has seen her act on the Orpheum. He says:</p>
<p><strong>138. int. rabinowitz home</strong>: The cantor, much older
and more feeble than when we last saw him, is seated at the table in the
living room. His beard is almost white and the hair about his temples is
white and thin. There are deep lines in his face, but a look of
resignation has taken the place of the indomitable sternness that marked
his appearance ten years before. At his side is standing a little Jewish
boy, Moey – a youngster of about ten – a typical ghetto child of the
underfed, frail build. He is singing and the old man is nodding his head
in time as he does so.</p>
<p><strong>139. close shot both</strong>: The cantor suddenly stops the
boy. He tells him that he is singing it wrong. He adds:</p>
<p><strong>140. close-up cantor</strong>: He looks at the boy and his
mind seems to wander. There is a misty look in his eyes as he says:</p>
<p><strong>141. close shot both</strong>: Moey looks up at him
curiously. The old man has turned his eyes back into the past and is
oblivious to the boy’s presence until Moey looks up and says:</p>
<p><strong>142. med. shot room</strong>: The boy starts out of the room
at this, and the cantor sits down again and is deep in thought as Moey
exits.</p>
<p><strong>143. rabinowitz living room</strong>: Mrs. Rabinowitz is
seated in the rocking chair, just opposite and a short distance from
Yudelson. Both have aged considerably. Yudelson is better dressed and
has more of the air of a prosperous citizen. His beard is neatly trimmed
and he wears well-tailored clothes. Mrs. Rabinowitz’s hair is grayer and
there are deeper lines in her face. She is leaning over, listening to
Yudelson who has a letter in his hand from which he is reading.</p>
<p><strong>144. close shot both</strong>: Yudelson looks up from the
letter as he says: “Y’ understand what he means?” He starts to explain.
But Mrs. Rabinowitz stops him and says:</p>
<p><strong>145. close-up yudelson</strong>: He is reading the letter
with elaborate gesticulations.</p>
<p><strong>146. close shot both</strong>: Mrs. Rabinowitz asks Yudelson
what Jakie means by headliner. Yudelson explains, and the old lady is
thoughtful a moment.</p>
<p><strong>147. close-up mother</strong>: She hesitates a moment, then
turns to Yudelson and says:</p>
<p><strong>148. close shot both</strong>: Yudelson again reads the
passage about Mary Dale. He looks at Mrs. Rabinowitz as though realizing
what she is thinking of. He says: “Nu, anything else?” Mrs. Rabinowitz
hesitates, then says:</p>
<p><strong>149. long shot backstage</strong>: It is the stage of the
State-Lake theater in Chicago, and a matinee performance is in progress.
There is the usual activity among the stagehands preparatory to changing
the set. The act which is now on is a dancing act, and there is only a
fleeting glimpse of the dancers through the aperture of a narrow
entrance.</p>
<p><strong>150. med. shot stage</strong>: Through entrance from another
angle there is a more complete view of the dancers. Mary Dale, the
principal of the act, is seen doing a movement of her dance. As the
dance comes to a close, a figure comes into the foreground, and a side
view shows that it is Jack Robin in blackface. He applauds from the
wings as Mary finishes. Apparently he is just ready to go on with his
act, or has just finished and is watching Mary before he takes the
make-up off his face.</p>
<p><strong>151. close-up jack</strong>: He is applauding vigorously.</p>
<p><strong>152. med. shot same</strong>: Mary almost backs into Jack as
she comes off the stage, and he puts out a hand to catch her arm. The
supporting dancers have exited on the other side. There is just time for
an exclamation of surprise from Mary as she goes on the stage again for
another bow. She turns to Jack as she gets to him and puts a hand on his
arm, as he compliments her on her dancing.</p>
<p><strong>153. close-up jack and mary</strong>: She says to Jack with a
humorous gleam in her eye:</p>
<p><strong>154. med. shot same</strong>: Mary is out on the stage bowing
to the audience again. She bows several times as she backs into the
narrow space again where Jack awaits her.</p>
<p><strong>155. full shot stage</strong>: As Jack and Mary walk toward
the dressing rooms, several persons on the stage observe them. Two of
the girls in the dancing act who are standing at a door on the balcony
overlooking the stage look at them and turn to each other.</p>
<p><strong>156. close-up girls</strong>: One of them, indicating Jack
and Mary, says to the other:</p>
<p><strong>157. med. shot jack and mary</strong>: They are standing in
front of the door of the stage dressing room. Jack starts to leave, but
Mary halts him telling him that she has something to show him. He looks
at her wonderingly. She opens the door and darts into the room,
returning immediately with a telegram which she hands him.</p>
<p><strong>158. close-up jack and mary</strong>: Jack takes the telegram
and looks at it. It reads:</p>
<p><strong>new york</strong>: Miss Mary Dale State-Lake Theater,
Chicago, Ill. Would you consider leading role new musical show Fall
opening, rehearsals begin two weeks. Wire answer.</p>
<p><strong>159. full shot along dressing rooms</strong>: As Mary and
Jack are talking, the door of another room opens and the head of Buster
Billings comes out. He sees Jack and shouts to him to hurry up and get
dressed. Jack, with another hesitating look at Mary during which he
seems desirous of saying something else, turns suddenly and leaves her.
She pauses a moment and looks after him. Then with a smile, she enters
her own room and closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>160. int. jack’s room</strong>: He enters, followed by
Buster, who is urging him to get cleaned up and dressed. Jack turns to
the table, hesitates, and turns around to Buster.</p>
<p><strong>161. close-up both</strong>: Jack tells him of Mary’s good
fortune. Buster nods understandingly as though to convey that he always
knew she would “make it.” Buster looks at Jack as though to read his
thoughts. Then he puts an arm on Jack’s shoulder and says:</p>
<p><strong>162. long shot michigan avenue</strong>: It is a general
atmospheric shot showing the traffic on the boulevard and the stately
line of high buildings on the West Side.</p>
<p><strong>163. med. shot theater entrance</strong>: It is the entrance
to a place like Orchestra Hall. There is a placard on an easel in the
center of the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>164. close shot entrance</strong>: The lettering on the
placard is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>special matinee</strong>: LAST CHICAGO CONCERT CANTOR
ROSENBLATT IN SACRED SONGS Popular Prices</p>
<p><strong>165. med. shot entrance</strong>: Among the people passing
are Jack and Buster. Jack’s eyes fall on the placard and he stops.
Buster stops and looks at Jack, who immediately shifts his glance. He
takes a quick look at his wristwatch.</p>
<p><strong>166. close-up jack and buster</strong>: Jack tells Buster to
go ahead adding:</p>
<p><strong>167. med. shot lobby</strong>: Jack dashes up to the box
office, lays down a bill, takes a ticket in return, and goes quickly to
the entrance through which he disappears.</p>
<p><strong>168. int. theater full shot from center</strong>: The place
is filled with a fashionable throng and a generous sprinkling of Jewish
types, mostly the better, well-to-do Jews of both sexes. The stage is
set for concert. There is a small orchestra of string pieces and a grand
piano. A man of dignified appearance and dressed in stylish afternoon
clothes comes out of the wings and faces the audience.</p>
<p><strong>169. close-up man</strong>: He announces:</p>
<p><strong>170. med. shot stage</strong>: As the announcer retires,
Cantor Rosenblatt appears and takes his position. He turns to the
orchestra leader who gives the signal for the orchestra to play the
introduction.</p>
<p><strong>171. close-up cantor</strong>: He starts singing “Eli,
Eli.”</p>
<p><strong>172. close shot audience</strong>: In a small group sits Jack
Robin. He is sitting up straight, his eyes fixed on the cantor in an
almost hypnotic stare.</p>
<p><strong>173. med. shot stage</strong>: Showing the cantor singing and
the orchestra playing.</p>
<p><strong>174. close-up jack</strong>: He has slumped in his seat and
he is listening intently, his eyes still fixed on the singer.</p>
<p><strong>175. reverse shot cantor</strong>: It is a fairly close shot
of the singer alone as Jack would see him from a seat well in front of
the house. The figure slowly dissolves into the figure of Jack’s aged
father, Cantor Rabinowitz.</p>
<p><strong>176. close-up jack</strong>: His eyes are half closed as he
visions his aged father singing in Rosenblatt’s place. He rubs a hand
across his eyes slowly.</p>
<p><strong>177. close-up rabinowitz</strong>: The figure slowly
dissolves into the real singer, Rosenblatt. In this shot he finishes the
song. He bows and starts to exit.</p>
<p><strong>178. close shot section audience</strong>: They are
applauding. Jack is still under the spell of the singing and his
thoughts. The people on either side of him get up and start out. He is
alone, slumped down in his seat, his eyes half closed again as the scene
slowly FADES OUT.</p>
<p><strong>179. synagogue anteroom</strong>: There are about twenty
Jewish boys in the room, much as they were in the early part of the
story. One of the boys, Moey, goes over to the battered old piano,
which, like other furniture of the room, is exactly as it was ten years
ago. Moey starts to play on the piano and the boys quickly gather around
him. They start to sing with him.</p>
<p><strong>180. close-up moey</strong>: He is playing and singing “Yes,
Sir, She’s My Baby” with much gusto.</p>
<p><strong>181. med.shot group</strong>: All of the boys are singing
with him.</p>
<p><strong>182. ext. synagogue</strong>: Cantor Rabinowitz, much more
feeble than when we last saw him, is approaching the door of the room in
which the boys are singing. He pauses as he hears the strains of
unfamiliar – and, to his ears, profane – music.</p>
<p><strong>183. close-up cantor</strong>: As he stops, his brow sets in
a frown and his lips tighten. He throws back his shoulders in a
determined manner and starts for the door.</p>
<p><strong>184. int. room med. shot</strong>: The boys are still singing
the popular song to Moey’s jazzy accompaniment.</p>
<p><strong>185. full shot room from piano</strong>: The door opens and
the cantor’s rigid figure appears. One of the boys jabs Moey in the back
with a whispered alarm.</p>
<p><strong>186. close-up moey</strong>: As the other boy jabs him, Moey,
with hardly a change in tempo, starts playing and singing “Eli, Eli”
with a very sanctimonious expression on his face.</p>
<p><strong>187. med. shot boys</strong>: They, with Moey, are all
singing “Eli, Eli.”</p>
<p><strong>188. full shot room from door</strong>: The boys are singing
the famous wailing song, as the cantor, standing in the foreground,
listens uncertainly.</p>
<p><strong>189. close-up cantor</strong>: He brushes a hand across his
forehead in a perplexed manner. He is sure that the music he heard from
outside was not “Eli, Eli.” Yet, he is getting old and perhaps his ears
are failing as well as his sight. Maybe he has done the boys an
injustice. His manner relaxes and he starts toward the boys.</p>
<p><strong>190. full shot room</strong>: The cantor goes over to a side
of the room, hangs up his battered old derby hat, and puts on his
familiar skullcap. One of the boys turns around and, just as though
discovering that the cantor has entered, he tells Moey.</p>
<p><strong>191. close shot moey and boys</strong>: Moey gives an
exclamation of surprise and stops playing suddenly. The boys cease
singing also and, with their best synagogue manner, they start toward
the cantor to extend the usual salutation. Moey goes to the other side
of the piano on which there is a box. He picks up the box and goes
toward the cantor.</p>
<p><strong>192. med. shot cantor</strong>: As Moey with the box goes up
to him, the other boys fall in behind him. The cantor looks at them in a
surprised way, reaches in his pocket for his glasses and puts them on,
looks at Moey, and says: “Nu, what is going on yet?” Moey hands the box
in the direction of the cantor and starts to say something.</p>
<p><strong>193. close-up moey and cantor</strong>: Moey stammers a
moment, then reaches in his pocket and, with the other hand still
holding out the box, he unfolds a wrinkled slip of paper with the other,
holds it up, and reads it:</p>
<p><strong>194. close-up cantor</strong>: He unfolds the shawl eagerly
and holds it up in pleased admiration, saying:</p>
<p><strong>195. med. shot group</strong>: The boys gather around him.
Moey assumes an air of importance.</p>
<p><strong>196. close-up moey</strong>: He says, in reply to the
cantor’s remarks:</p>
<p><strong>197. med. shot group</strong>: The cantor beams on Moey again
as he starts wrapping the shawl up again. He puts it in its box and
places it on the piano, then turns to the boys.</p>
<p><strong>198. close-up cantor</strong>: He assumes his old familiar
attitude as he addresses the youngsters, saying:</p>
<p><strong>199. med. shot group</strong>: The boys line up in their
accustomed manner, and the cantor gives them the signal to begin
singing.”</p>
<p><strong>200. int. living room full shot</strong>: Sara is standing at
the table talking to another woman, Mrs. Rubin. She is untying a parcel
and the other woman is watching her eagerly.</p>
<p><strong>201. close shot both</strong>: As Sara unwraps the package,
she takes out a prayer shawl. She holds it up in admiration as she
says:</p>
<p><strong>202. ext. home</strong>: Yudelson is coming along the street
with several packages and carrying a jug of wine under his arm. He
mounts the steps and rings the bell at the Rabinowitz door.</p>
<p><strong>203. close-up yudelson</strong>: He readjusts the packages
which are slipping from his hold. One of the packages is seen to be a
large fowl, of which the feet are protruding. He transfers the jug of
wine carefully to the other hand.</p>
<p><strong>204. int. home</strong>: Mrs. Rabinowitz hears the bell and
starts for the door. Mrs. Rubin starts to make a hurried exit out of the
back door as though not desiring to encounter visitors in her
housedress, but is prevailed upon to remain, as Sara goes to the front
door to admit Yudelson. Mrs. Rabinowitz reappears, ushering in the
visitor very ceremoniously. Mrs. Rubin goes up to greet the new arrival,
apologizing as she does for her attire. Yudelson walks over to the table
and dumps on it his parcels with a long sigh of relief. The last thing
he deposits is the jug of wine, which he sets down carefully.</p>
<p><strong>205. close-up group</strong>: As Yudelson arranges the
parcels on the table, Mrs. Rabinowitz looks askance at him, and
Mrs. Rubin starts fingering the fowl. He tells Sara that it is for the
cantor’s birthday dinner. He picks up the long package and hands it to
Sara, saying:</p>
<p><strong>206. close-up both women</strong>: Sara whispers to
Mrs. Rubin:</p>
<p><strong>207. full shot room</strong>: As Sara finishes title,
Yudelson joins the women. He asks where the cantor is and Sara points to
the synagogue next door. Yudelson says he’ll drop in on him and exits
out of the front door, leaving it open behind him. Sara picks up the
packages, then drops that containing the shawl back on the table and
takes the fowl into the kitchen. Mrs. Rubin tells her she must be going,
and she goes out with her. In the distance she is seen going out of the
back door.</p>
<p><strong>208. ext. street</strong>: Coming along the street
approaching the house is Jack Robin. He is walking briskly, a leather
traveling bag in one hand, a cane in the other, and a straw hat set
rakishly on his head. He is wearing a well- fitting grey suit, tailored
in excellent taste. People he passes stop and look at him as though they
thought such a figure was out of place in this neighborhood. He looks
curiously at the house in which he spent his early youth and passes up
the steps.</p>
<p><strong>209. ext. entrance close shot</strong>: At the door which
stands slightly ajar as Yudelson left it, Jack pauses. His light manner
leaves him as he finds himself again on the threshold of his home. He
hesitates as though not knowing whether to ring the bell or walk in. He
finally decides on the latter and enters the house hesitatingly.</p>
<p><strong>210. int. living room full shot</strong>: Sara is visible
through the door into the kitchen as Jack walks into the room rather
haltingly. He lays down his bag on a chair, places his stick alongside
of it, and looks about to note what changes have been wrought since he
left home. His attention is attracted to sounds from without. He pauses
and listens.</p>
<p><strong>211. int. choir room full shot</strong>: The boys under the
leadership of the cantor are singing.</p>
<p><strong>212. med. shot jack</strong>: He recognizes the air, and a
look of yearning comes into his eyes. He brushes away a tear. Then as he
spies his mother in the kitchen, he coughs to attract her attention.</p>
<p><strong>213. close-up mother</strong>: She turns suddenly from the
fowl on which she has been working. She is startled for a moment, then
the look of surprise is followed by a puzzled glance at the stranger in
the living room. Slowly over her face comes a realization of the
identity of the visitor. With a glad cry she starts toward the other
room.</p>
<p><strong>214. int. living room med. shot</strong>: Jack sees his
mother coming toward him and, with arms outstretched, he goes forward to
greet her and in a moment they are locked in each other’s arms.</p>
<p><strong>215. close-up mother and son</strong>: As they kiss each
other affectionately, Sara wipes the tears from her eyes. There are
tears of joy in Jack’s eyes too. Finally he holds her off and looks at
her with a semblance of his old impudent grin. He says kiddingly:</p>
<p><strong>216. close shot both</strong>: Sara starts plying Jack with
questions which come so fast that he is obliged to call a halt. He puts
a hand gently over her mouth and says, “Listen, just a minute, Mama.” He
adds:</p>
<p><strong>217. med. shot same</strong>: Jack tells her to keep quiet a
moment. Then he goes to his bag, opens it, and extracts a small
jeweler’s box. He hands it to his mother, telling her it’s a little
something he picked up for her. She holds it a moment as she looks from
Jack to the box. He says it’s for her and to open it. She does so
hesitatingly, and her eyes widen as she sees the glittering brooch which
reposes in the plush-lined box.</p>
<p><strong>218. close-up mother</strong>: Her lips form the word
“diamonds” in a startled manner as her eyes reflect the glitter of the
jewel. She looks up at Jack and says:</p>
<p><strong>219. med. shot both</strong>: Jack laughs as he says of
course it’s for her. She shakes her head at this unheard of
extravagance. She tells him he shouldn’t have spent so much money for
her. Jack laughs heartily.</p>
<p><strong>220 close-up jack</strong>: He tells her that it’s nothing at
all, adding:</p>
<p><strong>221. med. shot both</strong>: Sara gets up and tells Jack
that she will call his father. Jack tells her not to, that he wants to
look around first. He spies the piano and goes over to it.</p>
<p><strong>222. close-up jack at piano</strong>: He looks over the
piano, fingers the keys appraisingly, and asks when they got it.</p>
<p><strong>223. close-up sara</strong>: She says:</p>
<p><strong>224. full shot room</strong>: Sara walks over to the piano as
Jack sits down and starts to play a jazzy tune. He gets through several
bars when the front door opens and the cantor appears. He hesitates at
the unwonted sounds coming from his cherished piano.</p>
<p><strong>225. close-up cantor</strong>: His brows knit in a deep frown
as he listens a moment. Then he takes a resolute step forward.</p>
<p><strong>226. full shot room from door</strong>: As the cantor enters
the room, he takes out his glasses and adjusts them. Sara sees him
coming and she puts a hand on Jack’s arm to stop him, telling him that
his father has arrived. Jack swings around on the stool, gets up, and
hurries over to greet his father. As Jack puts out his hand, the cantor
makes no effort to take it. Sara hurries forward.</p>
<p><strong>227. close shot three</strong>: Jack is saying, “Why, hello,
Papa!” The cantor remains impassive as the frown deepens. Sara goes to
him and, pointing to Jack, says eagerly to her husband:</p>
<p><strong>228. close-up cantor</strong>: He glares at Jack as he
demands:</p>
<p><strong>229. close shot group</strong>: Jack is abashed at this. He
hesitates and Sara rushes in and takes the blame for Jack playing. She
pleads with the old man to welcome Jack, but he remains adamant. He
again points a condemning finger at Jack.</p>
<p><strong>230. close-up father</strong>: He almost shouts at him:</p>
<p><strong>231. close shot group</strong>: Sara takes the cantor’s hand
and pleads with him, saying that Jack doesn’t deserve such treatment.
Jack assumes also a pleading attitude. Sara tells the cantor to remember
that it is his birthday. At this Jack goes to his bag.</p>
<p><strong>232. close-up jack at chair</strong>: He is rummaging in the
bag excitedly and fishes out a package. He looks up and says:</p>
<p><strong>233. close-up cantor and wife</strong>: Sara is talking to
him excitedly, telling him how wonderful that Jakie should remember all
these years, his papa’s birthday. The cantor is beginning to weaken
under this assault. Sara leaves him for Jack.</p>
<p><strong>234. med. shot room</strong>: Sara goes over to Jack
excitedly and takes the shawl from him. As she sees it, there is just a
second’s change when she sees with dismay that it is another prayer
shawl. Her manner changes immediately to one of excited delight. As Jack
looks appealingly at his father, Sara holds up the shawl for him.</p>
<p><strong>235. close-up sara</strong>: As she holds up the shawl,
stroking its soft folds affectionately, she says:</p>
<p><strong>236. med. shot group</strong>: Jack follows Sara to the side
of the old man. He takes the shawl from her and addressing his father
says, almost tearfully:</p>
<p><strong>237. close shot group</strong>: As the cantor stands
impassively, Sara takes his arm and says to him:</p>
<p><strong>238. close-up father</strong>: He glares at Jack. Finally he
holds up a hand for silence, then snaps out:</p>
<p><strong>239. close-up group</strong>: Sara tries to stop the old man.
Jack, surprised at this new attack, tries to defend himself. The old man
doesn’t want to listen. Finally Jack, aroused now to the fact that he
must fight to get the respect of his father, demands that his father
listen to him. He grasps his father’s hand. The old man stares at him in
surprise. He starts to protest and Jack silences him.</p>
<p><strong>240. close-up jack</strong>: He leans forward as he says,
earnestly:</p>
<p><strong>241. close-up father and son</strong>: As Jack finishes
title, he endeavors to continue but the old man stops him. He points to
the door. Jack, with a gesture of defeat, turns away from him, toward
the chair upon which are his things.</p>
<p><strong>242. med. shot group</strong>: Sara goes to the old man and
pleads with him not to be so hard on their only boy. The old man
stiffens and waves her away. Jack starts closing his bag. The old man
picks up the shawl and holds it to him, saying that he wants nothing
bought with his unclean money.</p>
<p><strong>243. close-up jack and mother</strong>: He finally disengages
her hands and talks to her soothingly. He picks up his things and starts
to go. Then he turns and faces his father.</p>
<p><strong>244. close-up father</strong>: He stands looking over Jack’s
head, silently waiting his departure .</p>
<p><strong>245. close-up jack</strong>: He hesitates a moment, then
addresses his father quietly. He says:</p>
<p><strong>246. med. shot group</strong>: The father affects not to
hear. He merely points to the door. Jack turns to his mother, says
good-by to her again, and starts toward the door. The old man stands
impassively as Jack passes him on his way out. Sara makes an impulsive
gesture in Jack’s direction, but the old man stays her with a slight
movement of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>247. full shot stage theater</strong>: The camera is set
upstage center and is shooting toward footlights. There is a row of
twenty-four chorus girls downstage, extending across, all in rehearsal
rompers, and they are dancing in unison. As they finish a kick, a tall
lanky figure of a man in shirt-sleeves rises from the footlights and
halts them with a hand in the air. He is Jim Sparks who puts on the
dances, and he starts telling the girls in expressive language just what
he thinks of their efforts and where he thinks they belong.</p>
<p><strong>248. close-up sparks</strong>: He finishes telling them what
he thinks of them, then tells them to watch him. Although his timing and
technique are correct, his efforts, because of his build and attire,
make him appear ludicrous. He stops and calls to the piano player to do
it over again. Addressing the girls, he says:</p>
<p><strong>249. full shot stage from side</strong>: Sparks backs away
and the girls go into the steps as he did it. He nods approvingly. A
small group of people appear in the wings on the opposite side of the
stage and stand watching the dancers. There are two men and a woman.</p>
<p><strong>250. close shot group</strong>: Camera is in wings behind
them and dancers are seen in the background going through their
evolutions. The girl turns to talk to the man at her left, and it is
seen that she is Mary Dale. The man is Randolph Dillings, a middle-aged,
well-dressed, rather distinguished type, a well-to-do businessman who
finds amusement and sometimes profit in dabbling in stage enterprises.
The other man, somewhat younger, is Harry Lee, the producer of the
show.</p>
<p><strong>251. close-up dillings</strong>: He looks away from the
dancers and says something to Lee.</p>
<p><strong>252. close-up lee</strong>: He answers Dillings and turns
away with a frown.</p>
<p><strong>253. close shot three</strong>: Lee turns to Mary and tells
her that it is about time that the new comedian is showing up. Mary
smiles and tells him that they needn’t worry about him. Dillings turns
to Mary anxiously and says:</p>
<p><strong>254. ext. stage door</strong>: The old man who sits in the
doorway looks up and instinctively puts a foot across the entrance, and
a second later Jack Robin appears. He is not carrying the bag or cane
now. Otherwise he appears as he did a few hours earlier at the home of
his father. He tells the old man who he is. The latter grudgingly admits
him.</p>
<p><strong>255. full shot stage from wings</strong>: The three are still
in the foreground, and Sparks is drilling the girls relentlessly. They
stop at the end of the dance, and Sparks walks over to the group.
Dillings steps over and starts to talk to him as Jack comes into the
scene. Mary turns as she hears his step and goes to greet him. Lee
stands where he was. Jack stops as he sees Mary. She goes to him with
outstretched hands.</p>
<p><strong>256. close-up jack and mary</strong>: He stands looking at
Mary in a surprised manner as she comes into scene and greets him. Jack
is still speechless except for the first “Mary Dale!” Mary takes his
hand. He looks at her, then blurts out:</p>
<p><strong>257. med. shot same</strong>: Lee and Dillings come into the
scene and Mary presents Jack to them. Jack is somewhat embarrassed. He
shakes hands perfunctorily with Dillings but is rather more impressed by
Lee. Dillings turns away after the introduction, and Lee, trying to put
Jack at his ease, asks him if he will be ready for a rehearsal that
evening. Jack nods.</p>
<p><strong>258. close-up jack and lee</strong>: Lee takes a part book
out of his pocket and hands it to Jack and tells him he will give him
the songs later. He says to Jack:</p>
<p><strong>259. med. shot group</strong>: Mary and Dillings rejoin Jack
and Lee. Mary’s attitude toward Jack is so friendly that Dillings looks
askance at her. Mary and Jack start talking about the last time they saw
each other in Chicago. Dillings breaks in on the conversation. Lee looks
at his watch and walks away toward the center of the stage.</p>
<p><strong>260. close shot three</strong>: Dillings turns to Mary and
says that if she is ready he will take her to dinner. Mary hesitates a
moment, then after a quick look at Jack, she turns to Dillings and
says:</p>
<p><strong>261. int.cafe close-up</strong>: Jack and Mary are sitting in
a corner of the cafe at a little table facing each other. Mary is
talking with animation. The waiter sets down some dishes before them and
exits. Mary finishes what she is saying and Jack leans forward. He
says:</p>
<p><strong>262. close-up dillings</strong>: The camera is behind him and
takes in part of his shoulder and hand holding newspaper, without
disclosing his identity.</p>
<p><strong>263. close-up dillings from front</strong>: He is seated in a
very luxuriously equipped office. He shows much annoyance at what he has
read. He crumples up the paper and throws it on the floor. Then he hurls
his cigar into a corner of the room. He pauses a moment as though
considering what to do and finally jumps to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>264. full shot office</strong>: Dillings goes quickly over to
a hat tree, takes his coat and hat, and exits hastily.</p>
<p><strong>265. int. theater</strong>: With camera in fly gallery,
unique shot may be had of chorus in action on stage in the midst of a
rehearsal. Mary Dale is doing her dance with the chorus.</p>
<p><strong>266. close-up mary</strong>: She is seen as from the front in
her dance.</p>
<p><strong>267. full shot stage from wings</strong>: The chorus closes
in behind Mary in some evolution of the dance, as Jack and another
player, both in costume, come into the foreground. As the dance ends,
they applaud heartily, and Lee, who has taken charge of the last few
rehearsals, motions from the side, dismissing them. The girls troop off
on the other side and Mary comes over to Jack.</p>
<p><strong>268. close-up jack and mary</strong>: Jack is still
applauding Mary as she, slightly out of breath from her exertions, joins
him. He takes her hands and tells her what a wonderful dancer she is.
Mary smiles in a deprecating manner and says:</p>
<p><strong>269. full shot stage</strong>: As Mary leaves him, Jack turns
around to look after her. He hesitates, however, as he sees Lee and
Randolph Dillings, a few steps away, follow the girl with their eyes,
then turn and look at him. Jack starts toward them, then, seeing that
they start talking earnestly together, he turns the other way as though
to go over on the other side of the stage. He goes to the piano
downstage.</p>
<p><strong>270. close-up lee and dillings</strong>: Dillings has
finished saying something to him as Lee’s jaw drops. He looks at him in
surprise and blurts out:</p>
<p><strong>271. full shot stage</strong>: As Dillings leaves, Lee
follows him, still eagerly trying to explain that there is nothing
between the two principals of the show. Just as he is about to exit,
Mary comes from her dressing room and almost collides with him. Lee
rushes up to them and takes Dillings’s arm. Jack, who is at the piano,
sees Mary and starts across stage toward the group.</p>
<p><strong>272. med. shot group</strong>: Mary takes Dillings’s arm, and
he stops his progress somewhat unwillingly. It is evident that he wishes
to avoid a scene with Mary. Before she can say anything, however, Lee
says to Mary:</p>
<p><strong>273. close-up mary and lee</strong>: She smiles quietly and
says to Lee:</p>
<p><strong>274. close-up of three</strong>: As Lee leans closer to hear
her answer, Mary says to Dillings:</p>
<p><strong>275. med. shot group</strong>: Dillings is raising his hat as
he endeavors again to leave, just as Jack comes into the scene. Jack
goes up to Dillings and says “how do you do” to him. The latter gives
him a cold look of nonrecognition, bows again stiffly to the other two,
and exits, Jack looking after him in mock dismay.</p>
<p><strong>276. close-up jack</strong>: He looks at the other two and
says ruefully:</p>
<p><strong>277. close shot three</strong>: Mary and Lee laugh at this
sally, and as Jack joins them, Mary looks up at Lee, her hand on his
arm:</p>
<p><strong>278. close-up mary</strong>: She says to Lee:</p>
<p><strong>279. close-up three</strong>: Lee pats the girl’s hand. He
hesitates, then says, “Oh, I’m always in a fix for money.” Mary is too
much in earnest, however, to accept this light dismissal of his
difficulty. She looks up at him and says:</p>
<p><strong>280. close-up jack and doorman</strong>: He is telling Jack
that there is a caller for him. Jack asks again what the name is. The
doorman says:</p>
<p><strong>281. full shot stage</strong>: The chorus girls are trooping
out on the stage from all sides for another number when Yudelson is seen
entering from the outer entrance. He looks around puzzled, as he would
be on a first visit to such a place. He stops and looks around him,
puzzled by the strange surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>282. close-up yudelson</strong>: He is dressed in his best
Shabbas suit as befits the business head of a prosperous congregation as
well as a successful broker. He looks around in a dazed way and his eyes
fall on the girls of the chorus. He has never seen that many bare knees
in his life and his eyes bulge. He starts in the direction of the stage
where the girls are congregating, in the manner of a man under a
hypnotic spell.</p>
<p><strong>283. med. shot jack</strong>: Jack, who has been talking to
Mary, spies Yudelson and starts toward him. Mary goes to the stage
opening.</p>
<p><strong>284. close-up group of girls</strong>: One of the girls in
the center of the group is doing some high kicks and the others are
critically viewing her efforts.</p>
<p><strong>285. med. shot stage</strong>: Yudelson walks right out on
the stage where the girls are grouped, his eyes fixed on the kicker’s
legs. Jack comes up to him and takes his arm, and Yudelson comes out of
his trance.</p>
<p><strong>286. close-up yudelson and jack</strong>: Yudelson exclaims
with pleasure as Jack takes his hand and shakes it, although he is still
puzzled at Jack’s appearance. He shakes his head as he sees the changes
that the years have wrought in the boy. He points to the door and
says:</p>
<p><strong>287. full shot stage</strong>: As Jack and Yudelson walk
toward camera, Lee calls for the rehearsal of another number and the
girls start taking their positions. Yudelson, now in the immediate
foreground, turns around to get another look. Jack, laughing, turns him
back the other way, telling him that he’s liable to lose an eye if he
doesn’t look out. Yudelson pulls himself together. He turns to Jack
seriously as both stop just clear of the stage.</p>
<p><strong>288. close-up both</strong>: Yudelson tells Jack he has an
important message for him. Jack looks at him, a question in his eyes.
Yudelson says:</p>
<p><strong>289. close-up jack</strong>: He is saying to himself: “Two
weeks – since the day I was there.”</p>
<p><strong>290. close-up both</strong>: Jack looks at Yudelson as though
weighing his request. Yudelson continues with his arguments, saying that
some of the committee were against it, but he insisted because they all
owed him money. As a final argument he says to Jack, eagerly:</p>
<p><strong>291. med. shot same</strong>: As Yudelson turns, Mary comes
into scene. Yudelson pauses and looks at her. Jack, somewhat embarrassed
as Mary looks from him to Yudelson, introduces them. Yudelson gives her
an admiring look. He gives Jack a look of approval as though personally
complimenting him on his good taste. Realizing instinctively that the
girl has some influence with Jack, he tries to prevail on her to
persuade Jack to do what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>292. close-up three</strong>: Mary looks at Yudelson, then at
Jack. The latter explains the situation. Mary looks at Yudelson, full of
sympathy but unable to help him. She shakes her head as she tells him
the impossibility of his wish coming true. Yudelson shakes hands with
Jack, then with Mary and turns to leave.</p>
<p><strong>293. med. shot same</strong>: As Yudelson walks slowly away,
Lee comes into the scene. He pauses and looks toward the stage.</p>
<p><strong>294. close-up lee</strong>: He yells to the girls:</p>
<p><strong>295. close-up jack and mary</strong>: Jack is on the verge of
tears and Mary pats his shoulder softly.</p>
<p><strong>296. living room cantor’s home</strong>: Yudelson is sitting
in a rocking chair reading a Yiddish newspaper. Mrs. Rubin is using a
broom on the floor. She comes over to Yudelson and starts to talk with
him.</p>
<p><strong>297. close-up both</strong>: The woman points to the bedroom
door and asks Yudelson if he thinks the cantor will recover. Yudelson
affects a facetious manner in order to cover up his grief. He says,
flippantly:</p>
<p><strong>298. med. shot same</strong>: Mrs. Rubin shakes her head
sadly and continues her work. Seeing that he is not observed, Yudelson
takes out his handkerchief surreptitiously and gives his eyes a furtive
wipe. He looks toward the bedroom door in the background as it opens,
and a young woman in nurse’s garb comes into the room. Yudelson gets up
and rushes to her with a question as to how the cantor is getting along.
She shakes her head, and Yudelson drops into the chair as the nurse
proceeds to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>299. int. bedroom full shot</strong>: Cantor Rabinowitz, pale
and emaciated, is lying helplessly on the bed. His eyes are open and are
fixed on the figure of Sara who is busying herself about the room. He
motions feebly to her, and she hastens over to his side. She sits in the
chair at the bedside and leans over closely to hear what he has to say,
gently stroking his hand which she has taken.</p>
<p><strong>300. close-up cantor and wife</strong>: He asks her to lean
closer and as she does he starts to whisper to her.</p>
<p><strong>301. close-up cantor</strong>: He looks at his wife
pathetically. He says hesitatingly:</p>
<p><strong>302. close-up both</strong>: Sara pats his hand soothingly
and tells him not to worry about that – that he will be well sooner if
he doesn’t worry. His eyes are in the past, however, and he is not
listening to her. He continues:</p>
<p><strong>303. med. shot living room</strong>: Mrs. Rubin is again
talking to Yudelson. He is trying to get her to quit talking.</p>
<p><strong>304. close-up both</strong>: She leans over and, undismayed
by his manner, she asks with many gestures:</p>
<p><strong>305. full shot room</strong>: Mrs. Rubin hears a ring at the
door and hurries to the entrance. Yudelson gets up as Dr. O’Shaughnessy
enters. He is a big husky, grey- haired Irishman, and he greets the two
of them heartily, as one would very old friends.</p>
<p><strong>306. int.bedroom close-up</strong>: The cantor still has his
eyes closed, and Sara is stroking his forehead. Without opening his
eyes, he reaches up and puts his withered old hand on that of hers. He
opens his eyes and smiles wanly at her. Then he says:</p>
<p><strong>307. close-up cantor</strong>: He pauses a moment, then
continues:</p>
<p><strong>308. close-up both</strong>: Sara looks startled as the idea
comes into her mind of getting Jakie. She removes her hand and looks
down to measure the possible effect of her departure.</p>
<p><strong>309. full shot room</strong>: As Sara is nervously
considering her next step, the door opens and the doctor enters, solving
Sara’s problem for the moment. She tells the cantor that the doctor is
here and that she will go away for a little while. The nurse follows the
doctor into the room and Sara exits.</p>
<p><strong>310. int. living room</strong>: As Sara enters, she goes
hurriedly to Yudelson. Mrs. Rubin comes over hastily in fear of losing a
word.</p>
<p><strong>311. close-up group</strong>: Sara tells Yudelson that she is
going to get Jakie. The latter tells her it’s no use, but she is
insistent, and he agrees to go along. Sara tells Mrs. Rubin to remain
there until they return.</p>
<p><strong>312. int.bedroom med. shot</strong>: The doctor is leaning
over the sick man, listening to his heart with a stethoscope. The
cantor’s eyes are closed. The nurse stands at the side of the doctor. He
raises up, folds the stethoscope, and looks at the nurse. They exchange
a look which both understand as leaving little hope for the life of the
cantor.</p>
<p><strong>313. theater stage from front</strong>: The orchestra is in
the foreground, and the curtain is down. In the immediate foreground are
empty seats in the first few rows of the house, and several men with
hats on are sitting down front. Lee is among them. He calls out
something, and the orchestra starts to play the curtain music.</p>
<p><strong>314. close-up lee and other man</strong>: The man with him is
a typical businessman of Hebraic type – the sort that one finds
financing shows on Broadway. Lee turns to him and says:</p>
<p><strong>315. full shot stage from front</strong>: The men are in the
foreground as before, and Lee nods anxiously as the other man finishes
the title. The orchestra gives a signal and the curtain goes up, showing
the line of girls across the stage for their first number.</p>
<p><strong>316. int. jack’s dressing room</strong>: Jack is dressed and
is just beginning to put on his facial make-up when Mary enters. She
pirouettes before him and pouts as he evinces only a slight interest in
her. She stops and goes over to him.</p>
<p><strong>317. close-up jack and mary</strong>: Mary puts a hand on
Jack’s shoulder and, pointing to her costume, as he turns around, says
to him:</p>
<p><strong>318. long shot stage</strong>: This is a shot downward from
fly gallery, showing one of the ensemble dance numbers in progress, just
as it would be were the performance really on. The chorus falls back and
two adagio dancers come on.</p>
<p><strong>319. med. shot stage from front</strong>: The adagio dancers
do a part of their routine.</p>
<p><strong>320. close-up dressing room</strong>: Jack has just about
completed his make-up. Mary is sitting on a chair a short distance away.
They are talking as Jack puts the finishing touches to his make-up, the
enlarging of the lips. Mary leans over.</p>
<p><strong>321. close-up both</strong>: Mary asks him just what Yudelson
wanted of him. Jack explains about the age-old customs, which mark the
observation of Yom Kippur. Mary nods as he explains. She says:</p>
<p><strong>322. med. shot same</strong>: Jack nods and gets up. He
inspects his make-up in the glass closely. Mary looks at herself in the
long glass at the other side of the room as the stage doortender enters.
He pauses in the door and, as Jack sees him, he tells Jack that there is
someone at the door to see him.</p>
<p><strong>323. close-up doortender</strong>: He says
apologetically:</p>
<p><strong>324. full shot room</strong>: Jack stands and stares at him.
Mary starts for the door saying that she will leave. Jack motions to her
to remain.</p>
<p><strong>325. long shot toward door</strong>: Before the old doorman
can turn, Yudelson enters, followed by Sara. She is wearing a shawl over
her housedress, just as she left in her haste. As Jack sees her he goes
rapidly toward her, crying, “Mama!” She stands and looks at him in a
puzzled way. He goes up and takes her hands in his. He starts to kiss
her, then remembers her make-up. Sara holds him off as Yudelson comes up
to them, looking at Jack in a puzzled manner.</p>
<p><strong>326. close-up three</strong>: Sara looks at Jack, eager
though puzzled, and says:</p>
<p><strong>327. full shot room</strong>: Mary is standing in the
doorway, in the foreground. She looks intently from the mother to her
son, her gaze resting on him to see, if possible, what the results of
this visit will be. Then she turns slowly and leaves them, a worried
frown on her face.</p>
<p><strong>328. close-up mother and son</strong>: He is leaning close as
she talks. He tries to interrupt her with a hopeless gesture, but she
motions to him to listen to her. She continues:</p>
<p><strong>329. close-up yudelson</strong>: He leans over and adds his
argument:</p>
<p><strong>330. close-up mother and son</strong>: Jack takes her hand
tenderly and tells her that what she asks is impossible, that they’re
all depending on him – that this is the one big chance of his life. Fame
and fortune will be his if he succeeds. He adds:</p>
<p><strong>331. full shot room</strong>: Gene, the stage manager, comes
to the door and summons Jack. He starts to get up and Sara clings to
him. Mary enters again, worried about Jack.</p>
<p><strong>332. close-up gene</strong>: He says to Jack that the
orchestra is already playing his introduction.</p>
<p><strong>333. close-up jack and mother</strong>: He unfastens her
hands gently from him. He tells her that he must go on the stage and
tells her to wait.</p>
<p><strong>334. med. shot room</strong>: Jack starts out of the room
with his mother’s last plea ringing in his ears. Mary goes to her and
puts her arm around her. Yudelson follows Jack out curiously.</p>
<p><strong>335. full shot stage from front</strong>: The chorus is lined
up looking toward entrance at which Jack is expected. The orchestra is
playing the introduction to his song as he enters. He speaks the few
lines which serve as an introduction to his song and then begins singing
it.</p>
<p><strong>336. close-up jack</strong>: He goes into the first bars of
his song.</p>
<p><strong>337. med. shot outside room</strong>: Yudelson and Sara are
watching through the wings, but back in the passage leading to the
outside door. Mary asks Mrs. Rabinowitz if she doesn’t want to go
closer. She points to the stage but the mother shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>338. close-up yudelson</strong>: He is listening, an ear
cocked stageward. He nods as he says, half to himself:</p>
<p><strong>339. med. shot yudelson</strong>: Two girls in very scant
attire make him forget Jack for the moment as they pass close to him. He
looks after them in a daze and starts to follow them.</p>
<p><strong>340. full shot passage</strong>: Mary still has an arm around
Sara. The latter, overcome by emotion, starts for the door. Mary tries
to hold her because of Jack.</p>
<p><strong>341. close-up both</strong>: As Mary endeavors to persuade
Sara to remain, Sara tearfully says that she must go. She turns to Mary
and says, hopelessly:</p>
<p><strong>342. full shot same</strong>: Mary starts with Sara. Yudelson
suddenly sees them going toward the door. He looks after the two girls
who had attracted his attention, as though not knowing which to follow,
then reluctantly follows Sara. In the doorway Mary leans over and kisses
Sara. The latter grasps the girl’s arms eagerly.</p>
<p><strong>343. close-up mary and sara</strong>: The mother says to
her:</p>
<p><strong>344. med. shot stage</strong>: Jack is singing.</p>
<p><strong>345. close-up lee and gene</strong>: They are standing in the
wings. They look at each other in speechless admiration of Jack’s
singing.</p>
<p><strong>346. long shot through wings</strong>: Jack finishes song and
makes exit. As he comes into foreground, he is surrounded by Lee, Gene,
Mary, and several of the other principals. They grab his hands and
congratulate him. He smiles gratefully.</p>
<p><strong>347. close-up jack and lee</strong>: The latter is
enthusiastically pumping Jack’s hand as he says:</p>
<p><strong>348. med. shot outside dressing room</strong>: Those
surrounding Jack fall away from him as Mary goes to him. She takes his
hand and shakes it. She pantomimes that his mother has gone. Then she
turns and leaves. Jack wipes a white glove across his eyes, leaving a
white streak on his damp face. He comes slowly toward the camera and
enters the door of his dressing room.</p>
<p><strong>349. med. shot room</strong>: Jack goes slowly to one of the
chairs in the room, drops heavily into it, and then leans over and puts
his blackened face into the white gloves.</p>
<p><strong>350. choir room synagogue</strong>: Yudelson is presiding at
a meeting of the synagogue trustees. He is seated at the head of the
little cheap table with a very important air. There are four others, all
in their holiday clothes. One is Levy, the Shammas, or sexton, a little
scrawny fellow with a straggling beard. Two others have the long
orthodox beards, and the fifth member of the committee is clean-shaven,
a prosperous Jewish businessman. Yudelson says something and they all
start talking at once. Levy finally attracts the attention of Yudelson.
He gets up and tries to speak. Yudelson endeavors to quiet him, but Levy
is insistent.</p>
<p><strong>351. close-up levy</strong>: He holds out both hands
pleadingly, as he says:</p>
<p><strong>352. close shot table</strong>: Yudelson interrupts him,
pounding on the table and ordering him to sit down. He insists that he
is chairman and must be listened to.</p>
<p><strong>353. close-up yudelson</strong>: He yells out at Levy:</p>
<p><strong>354. close shot group</strong>: Levy subsides with a beaten
gesture. His lifelong wish to sing “Kol Nidre” has been dashed to the
ground. Yudelson continues rubbing it in.</p>
<p><strong>355. close-up yudelson</strong>: He says, still glaring at
Levy and desiring to rub it in:</p>
<p><strong>356. close shot group</strong>: They all start arguing, and
Yudelson takes out his watch and tells the committee that the meeting is
over. They surround him and bombard him with questions as to who is
going to sing. He throws up his hands hopelessly and starts out of the
door, just as the boys of the choir start arriving.</p>
<p><strong>357. rabinowitz living room</strong>: Sara is sitting in the
rocking chair, rocking slowly back and forth. Her eyes are swollen with
crying. Her grief has reached the bottom-most depths. Every few moments
she looks toward the bedroom door as though expecting some message from
the sick chamber.</p>
<p><strong>358. close-up sara</strong>: As she rocks slowly. She looks
toward the bedroom, then suddenly wipes her eyes and gets up.</p>
<p><strong>359. full shot room</strong>: The nurse is just coming out of
the door. Sara goes toward her, but the nurse motions for silence as
Sara reaches her side.</p>
<p><strong>360. close-up nurse and sara</strong>: The nurse whispers to
her:</p>
<p><strong>361. ext. house</strong>: A taxicab drives up quickly, and
before it stops Jack is out of the door. He pays the driver and dashes
up the steps. Jack is dressed for the street in well-tailored but
quietly styled clothes. He rings the bell.</p>
<p><strong>362. close-up at door</strong>: The door is opened and Sara
appears. She looks at Jack in surprise, then throws her arms around him
saying:</p>
<p><strong>363. ext. synagogue</strong>: The doors are open and there is
a steady stream of people entering, Jews, old and young, bearded and
clean-shaven, women in shawls and stylish street attire. Occasionally a
fine automobile drives up and a prosperous family gets out, while the
liveried chauffeur holds open the door. Yom Kippur is about to begin,
the one holiday of the year when even the least orthodox Jews think of
their religion. It is approaching sundown and the sinking orb is casting
long shadows into the East Side street.</p>
<p><strong>364. int.house full shot living room</strong>: Jack and his
mother are standing in the middle of the floor, talking to the nurse.
The nurse is shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>365. close shot group</strong>: The nurse says as she shakes
her head that Dr. O’Shaughnessy would not want the sick man’s sleep
disturbed. Jack pleads with her.</p>
<p><strong>366. close-up jack</strong>: He takes the nurse’s arm
pleadingly and says:</p>
<p><strong>367. close-up group</strong>: The nurse finally succumbs to
Jack’s eloquent pleading and starts over toward the bedroom door,
followed by Jack and his mother.</p>
<p><strong>368. med. shot group</strong>: They reach the door. The nurse
cautions Jack to be very quiet as she slowly opens the door. She motions
for Sara to remain behind. Sara bursts into tears as she turns away.
Jack enters and the nurse closes the door softly behind him.</p>
<p><strong>369. full shot bedroom</strong>: The old cantor is lying with
his eyes closed as Jack enters on tiptoe. He walks very quietly over to
the bed where he stands for a moment, then he drops down to his knees
beside the bed and gives way to his grief.</p>
<p><strong>370. close-up jack and cantor</strong>: Jack, with eyes
streaming, puts out a hand to touch that of his father, then, fearing
that he will wake him with serious results, he withdraws his hand. His
shoulders are shaking convulsively with suppressed sobs, and he suddenly
buries his face in his hands, which are resting on the bed. The old
man’s eyelids flutter for a moment. His eyes slowly open and he looks
over and sees the bowed head of his son.</p>
<p><strong>371. close-up cantor</strong>: There is just the faintest
flicker of a smile on the wan face of the dying man. With an effort he
slowly moves his hand over until it rests on Jack’s head in an unspoken
blessing. Jack’s hands come up and grasp that of his father.</p>
<p><strong>372. close-up jack and father</strong>: With a sudden
impulsive gesture Jack grasps the hand of his father and kisses it. Then
the old man’s eyes close and Jack looks suddenly around to the door.</p>
<p><strong>373. close-up nurse at door</strong>: She is motioning for
Jack to come out. As she does, the figure of the doctor appears behind
her.</p>
<p><strong>374. full shot room</strong>: As the doctor enters, Jack goes
to the door. He grasps the doctor’s hand and the doctor greets him
heartily, though quietly. Jack points to the bed in mute inquiry. The
doctor says, quietly: “I’m afraid not.” He goes toward the bed and Jack
with streaming eyes starts slowly out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>375. ext. house</strong>: It is now almost dark and lights
are beginning to flicker. A taxicab drives up hurriedly and Mary and Lee
get out of it. Lee tells the driver to wait for them. Mary by this time
is looking at the number to verify the place. They hurry up the steps
and Mary rings the bell.</p>
<p><strong>376. int. living room full shot</strong>: Yudelson and
Mrs. Rabinowitz are standing at the door of the bedroom as the bell
rings. Sara tells Yudelson to go to the door. As he starts for it, the
door of the bedroom opens and Jack, wiping his eyes, comes slowly out
and into his mother’s arms.</p>
<p><strong>377. med. shot at door</strong>: Yudelson admits Mary and
Lee. They both ask at once for Jack, and as they see him they go quickly
toward him.</p>
<p><strong>378. close-up jack and mother</strong>: Jack’s attention is
attracted by the newcomers. He looks at them in surprise and half pushes
his mother away to greet them. He is still in a daze but realizes the
nature of their mission.</p>
<p><strong>379. med. shot group</strong>: Mary and Lee each take one of
Jack’s hands and ply him with questions as to what he is going to do.
Yudelson and Sara exchange significant glances.</p>
<p><strong>380. close-up door</strong>: Levy the Shammas enters
hurriedly.</p>
<p><strong>381. full shot room</strong>: Levy enters and goes quickly to
Yudelson. He tells him that the congregation is waiting for the services
to begin and suggests that he be designated to sing.</p>
<p><strong>382. close-up two men</strong>: Yudelson greets this
suggestion angrily. He yells at Levy:</p>
<p><strong>383. full shot room</strong>: As Jack argues with Lee and
Mary, Sara enters the group. She begs Jack to sing, for the sake of his
father. Yudelson walks to the side of the room and takes the cantor’s
praying shawl and skull cap which are hanging up. He carries them over
to Jack and holds them in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>384. close shot group</strong>: With Yudelson and his mother
on one side and Lee and Mary on the other, Jack is besieged by the old
life and the new, filial duty against his life’s ambition, the past
against the future. He stands staring from one to the other.</p>
<p><strong>385. close-up lee</strong>: He holds out his hands
appealingly. He says:</p>
<p><strong>386. close shot group</strong>: Mary adds her entreaties to
those of Lee, while Sara takes the shawl and cap from Yudelson and holds
them out to Jack mutely. Jack looks slowly from Mary to mother, then he
stares ahead as though trying to pierce the curtain of the future.</p>
<p><strong>387. theater lobby night</strong>: People in evening clothes
are passing into the brilliantly lighted lobby. There is a line at the
box office. In the center of the lobby are two large easels containing
photographs. Several persons pause before them.</p>
<p><strong>388. close-up easels</strong>: One of the easels contains a
full-length portrait of Mary Dale in ballet costume and the other a
full-length portrait of Jack Robin in blackface. There is a couple
standing beside it, and the man says to the woman that this fellow will
be the hit of the town. They pass in.</p>
<p><strong>389. med. shot lobby</strong>: The people are still passing
into the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>###. int. theater</strong>: It is a shot from about the
center of the audience showing the front part of the house filled with
people in evening dress. Several late arrivals enter. The orchestra has
presumably just finished the overture when a man in tuxedo steps from
behind the curtain at one side of the stage. He walks onto the apron and
starts making an announcement.</p>
<p><strong>390. close-up man</strong>: He says that he regrets to
announce that because of some unforeseen occurrence, the plans for
opening the “April Follies” have had to be changed at the last moment,
and he adds:</p>
<p><strong>391. full shot theater from stage</strong>: The people in the
theater are getting up and leaving.</p>
<p><strong>392. full shot cantor’s bedroom</strong>: The doctor is at
the bedside of the dying man. At the other side sits Sara, while the
nurse is busy at a nearby table. Sara realizes that the end is near, and
she is holding the hand of the old man as she weeps quietly.</p>
<p><strong>393. close-up bed</strong>: The cantor is lying on his back
with eyes closed. Just the outline of Sara is visible. The old man’s
eyes open slowly. The misty look slowly clears and, as he recognizes the
voice, he looks about him rather wildly. Slowly realization comes to him
that his last earthly wish has been granted. With a glorified smile on
his face, he mutters: “It’s my Jakie.” He starts to raise himself
slowly. He looks toward the window.</p>
<p><strong>394. full shot room</strong>: As the cantor slowly raises his
shattered body, the doctor, anticipating his wish, goes quickly to the
window and raises it.</p>
<p><strong>395. close-up cantor</strong>: He is raising himself until he
is almost sitting up in bed, Sara’s arm behind him, helping him. He
lifts his eyes to heaven and his lips move in a prayer. Then his eyes
close and he falls slowly back to the pillow. The end has come, and Sara
throws herself across his body in a paroxysm of grief.</p>
<p><strong>396. full shot synagogue</strong>: With the camera in back of
place, Jack, with prayer shawl and skullcap on, can be seen with back to
congregation. The choir boys are lined up on either side of him, facing
the center. His voice is now loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>397. close-up jack</strong>: He is singing, with eyes half
closed, one of the wailing passages from the “Kol Nidre.”</p>
<p><strong>398. int. living room med. shot</strong>: Mary and Lee stand
listening. In the background the doctor and nurse come quietly out of
the bedroom door. The nurse goes to the back of the house. The doctor
pauses and looks at the two listeners, then quietly goes to the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>399. close-up mary and lee</strong>: They are still listening
as though spellbound. As the volume increases, they look from one to the
other wonderingly. Lee says in an awe-stricken voice:</p>
<p><strong>400. int. synagogue close-up jack</strong>: He is singing an
exceptionally sorrowful passage of the “Kol Nidre.”</p>
<p><strong>401. med. shot jack</strong>: As he comes to the closing
notes of the song, the figure of the old cantor in his synagogue robes
appears on the side of the screen very faint and shadowy. The misty form
slowly comes to the side of the singer. It pauses. There is a smile on
the face of the old cantor as he slowly raises his hand in a blessing.
The shadowy figure becomes fainter and fainter, finally disappearing,
leaving Jack standing alone. The music and his figure slowly</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did you like that, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m glad of it. I’d rather please you than

<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh no–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, she will. You see if she isn’t. And I’m
gonna get you a nice pink dress that’ll go with your brown eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is – who is

Island.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, I’m gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes.

<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, no. I wouldn’t go …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, with me, it’s all right. I’ll kiss you
and hug you. You see if I don’t. Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You’re
