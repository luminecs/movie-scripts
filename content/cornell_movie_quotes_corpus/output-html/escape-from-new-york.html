<p><strong>card – 1988</strong>: FADE IN SECOND CARD – The Crime Rate in
the United States Rises Four Hundred Percent.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: In 1988, the crime rate in the United States
rises four hundred percent.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The once-great city of New York becomes the
one maximum-security prison for the entire country.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A fifty-foot containment wall is erected
along the New Jersey shoreline, across the Harlem river, and down along
the Brooklyn shoreline. It completely surrounds Manhattan Island.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: All bridges and waterways are mined.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The United States Police Force, like an army,
is encamped around the island.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There are no guards inside the prison: only
prisoners and the worlds they have made.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The rules are simple. Once you go in, you
don’t come out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. statue of liberty security control – night.</strong>: A
Jeep pulls up outside the base. It comes to a stop and the driver pulls
out a walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17. I
have an escape in progress. An object in mid-bay moving toward the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>tilt up – wall</strong>: EXT. CLOSE UP – SIGN “New York
Maximum Security Penitentiary Manhattan Island”</p>
<p><strong>continued tilt up – ext. wall – night</strong>: Two guards
watch for the escapees in question.</p>
<p><strong>ext. manhattan island – night</strong>: A helicopter flies
over the bay towards Manhattan Island.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boat – night</strong>: The two escapees paddle, trying
to get across the bay.</p>
<p><strong>ext. helicopter – night</strong>: The search light WHITES OUT
THE SCREEN</p>
<p><strong>ext. boat – night</strong>: The two escapees continue
paddling. THEY’VE BEEN CAUGHT.</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: You have 10 seconds. Turn around.
Start back to the island.</p>
<p><strong>int. helicopter – night</strong>: The pilot targets the boat
on a computer screen in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boat – night</strong>: Two shots are fired directly in
front of the escapees as a warning. They ignore them and continue
paddling away from the island.</p>
<p><strong>ext. close up – pilot’s hand</strong>: The pilot FIRES
AGAIN.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boat – night</strong>: The boat EXPLODES.</p>
<p><strong>ext. helicopter – night</strong>: Following the helicopter as
it returns to the base.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base – night</strong>: Rehme walks back to the main
base, pulling out his walkie-talkie on the way.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Gotham 4, confirm the kill.</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: Circled the base. Over.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Security, this is Rehme. We have confirmation
from Gotham 4. We have a kill in midharbor. South of the battery. Two in
the water dead.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Two confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base – night</strong>: Rehme walks into a building
labeled “LIBERTY ISLAND SECURITY CONTROL and picks up a phone.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Air traffic, this is Rehme . . .</p>
<p><strong>ext. air traffic – night</strong>: The helicopter lands. In
the background, a BUS FULL OF PRISONERS comes up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bus – night</strong>: S.D. “SNAKE” PLISSKEN gets off the
bus, looks around, and is escorted by three guards into the base. He
looks like the essence of cool. His hair is long, wavy, and ratty, he
lost his left eye somewhere along the line, and he’s got a two-day beard
thing going on. He’s wearing a black spandex/kevlar type shirt with
zippers across the shoulders, and a pair of camouflage pants with lots
of pockets. His jacket is a brown leather jacket that has seen far
better days, and he’s wearing a pair of handcuffs that have, instead of
the links we’re used to, a straight metal bar between them. He’s not
resisting anything, but the police are not taking any chances.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Plissken and the guards follow a
winding stairway down to the main floor.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Attention. You are now entering the
debarkation area. No talking. No smoking. The next scheduled departure
to the prison is in two hours. You now have the option to terminate and
be cremated on the premises. If you elect this option, notify the duty
sergeant in your processing area.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: EXT. CLOSE UP ON SIGN – “No
talking. No smoking. Follow the ORANGE line.” EXT. CLOSE UP ON SNAKE. He
is not impressed. STEADICAM VIEW OF THE HALL, SNAKE’S P.O.V. Guards,
guards, more guards. Who cares.</p>
<p><strong>o.s. guard</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>fade out.</strong>: ————————————————————————</p>
<p><strong>ext. base – night</strong>: Rehme waits as a limo pulls up.
Out steps BOB HAUK.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: We’ve got a small jet in trouble, over
restricted air space.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Seven miles out and closing.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Hauk and Rehme walk down the
stairs. They turn TOWARD US and walk into the AIR TRAFFIC ROOM. Dozens
of men sit in front of radar transmission screens, wearing headsets and
working. Following Hauk and Rehme into the room:</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: We’ve been on the board for the last twenty
minutes. We haven’t been able to reach them. There was a transmission
ten minutes ago. He identified as “David 14.” Then all of a sudden he
was cut off.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: David 14, acknowledge. David 14, we are
sending Air Rescue. Squawk 7700, contact on 121.5. There’s still no
reply. Bayonne. I have a mayday in restricted space.</p>
<p><strong>o.s. controller</strong>: New York, I have it.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: You have the code?</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: There’s no David 14 on the computer.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Unlisted?</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Unregistered code. We telexed Washington.
Still waiting for a reply.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: I think I’ve got him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rebel voice</strong>: It’s too late, assholes. All your
imperialist weapons and lies can’t save him now. We’re going down. We’re
going to crash.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: David 14, acknowledge!</p>
<p><strong>codeman</strong>: The code’s coming in, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ext. plane – night</strong>: The plane is flying over New
York.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit – night</strong>: The REBEL has killed the pilot
and copilot and is working on her own.</p>
<p><strong>rebel</strong>: Tell this to the workers when they ask where
your leader went . . .</p>
<p><strong>rebel</strong>: We, the soldiers of the national liberation
front of America, in the name of the workers and all the oppressed of
this imperialist country have struck a fatal blow to the racist police
stick!</p>
<p><strong>int. plane – night</strong>: A secret service AGENT taps on
the door with his rifle as the rebel continues.</p>
<p><strong>rebel</strong>: What better revolutionary example than to let
the president perish in the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist
prison?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Unlock the pod!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: She’s bolted the door.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Can’t you shoot off the lock?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: No, sir, she’s pressurized the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How about lifting the door off of the
hinges?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Get me to the pod.</p>
<p><strong>int. pod room – night</strong>: The pod opens. An expert
attaches a locating device to the President’s wrist.</p>
<p><strong>expert</strong>: Sir, this is a locating device to trace you
if you become separated from the pod. I’m activating it now.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: God save me and watch over you all.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base – night</strong>: A guard watches as Air Force One
descends into New York.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Rehme and Hauk watch a computer
simulation of the plane.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Computer simulation tracking Air Force
One.</p>
<p><strong>ext. new york – night</strong>: The plane goes down.</p>
<p><strong>ext. close up – monitors</strong>: As the plane smashes into
a building, a red dot drops through the building. It’s the pod.</p>
<p><strong>o.s. man</strong>: It’s down!</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: It’s the escape pod.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: 40 degrees, 50 yards from impact.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I’m going in.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base – night</strong>: Helicopters prepare for, and
execute, launch, and fly into New York. A guard watches them.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Rehme watches monitors as Hauk
talks.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: 1-W-Larry. Over the battery. We’re moving
down. Direct sight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. new york – night</strong>: The helicopters land. A swarm
of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs back. He follows with a second
swarm. The first swarm assumes a defensive position near the pod. Hauk
examines the pod. It’s definitely empty, and the rest of the jet is
surrounded in flames.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: You touch me… he dies. If you’re not in the
air in thirty seconds… he dies. You come back in… he dies.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Twenty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I’m ready to talk.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Nineteen. Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Seventeen. Sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Let’s go. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Rehme stands behind a desk,
talking on the phone. Hauk is in the foreground, looking pensive.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Yes, he’s right here, Mr. Vice President.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: This is Bob Hauk. …We can’t. If we move in
with choppers, they’ll kill him. We’re lucky if he’s not dead already…
They don’t want anything yet. By the time they figure out what they
want, it’ll be too late.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Tell him we have to go with your plan
now.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: We can’t wait until tomorrow. If we have to
move in and take the island, it’s a last resort. It’s 8:45. I want
permission to try a rescue. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>int. hauk’s office – night</strong>: Hauk calmly arms a .45
pistol. He looks up from his desk.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>overprotective security guard</strong>: He’s dangerous,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I know. I’ll be OK.</p>
<p><strong>hauk’s p.o.v.</strong>: We see the silhouette of an
unmistakable figure. It’s Snake Plissken all right, live and in the
flesh. The guards leave. Snake walks into Hauk’s office and sits down in
the chair across from Hauk. He raises his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to
say “Take these off me, asshole,” but he doesn’t actually say anything.
Hauk shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I’m not a fool, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Call me Snake.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: S.D. Plissken. American Lieutenant. Special
Forces Unit, Black Flight. Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.
Youngest man to be decorated by the President. You robbed the federal
reserve depository. Life sentence, New York Maximum Security
Penitentiary. I’m ready to kick your ass out of the world, War Hero.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Hauk. Police Commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Bob Hauk…</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Special Forces Unit. Texas Thunder. We heard
of you, too, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Why are we talking?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I have a deal for you. You’ll receive full
pardon for every criminal act committed in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: There was an accident about an hour ago. A
small jet went down inside New York City. The President was on
board.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: President of what?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: That’s not funny, Plissken. You go in, find
the President and bring him out in 24 hours, and you’re a free man.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Twenty-four hours, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I’m making you an offer.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Straight just like I said.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: No time. Give me an answer.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Get a new president.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: We’re still at war, Plissken. We need him
alive.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I don’t give a fuck about your war… or your
president.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Is that your answer?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’m thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Think hard.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad. You know
how to get in quiet. You’re all I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I guess I go in one way or the other. Doesn’t
mean shit to me. Give me the paper.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: When you come out.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Before.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I told you I wasn’t a fool, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Call me Snake.</p>
<p><strong>int. weapons room – night</strong>: Rehme talks as we PAN
ACROSS a table full of weapons. We see two guns, a belt, grenades,
several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a Uzi, throwing
stars, and more. Snake surveys them with a cool expression.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Some of them have cars. They took old junkers
that were left behind and converted them to steam. We think they may
also have a gasoline source in there, and power. Greenhouses, rigged up
generators. Some areas have streetlights. The crazies. Live in the
subways. Complete control of the underground. They’re night raiders.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Tracer. Sends a radio signal for fifteen
minutes. You push it, we can track you on radar. Just like Leningrad.
But they added something. A safety catch.</p>
<p><strong>int. hall – night</strong>: Snake has his jacket slung over
his shoulder now. He walks down the hall to the medical room with Hauk.
Rehme has disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Where am I landing?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Top of the world trade center. Only place you
can land. They won’t see it, and you can take off from a free fall. On
the roof there’s a service elevator. It’s still operational. We use it
to infiltrate the prison. There’s a power box. It’ll activate the
elevator down to fifty. From there on down you walk.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: You can locate the President by his vital
signs bracelet, on his wrist. It sends out a sig pulse. Use this.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Homing device. Shows directions and
distance.</p>
<p><strong>int. medical room – night</strong>: Snake and Hauk walk into
the room. They’re met by a young medic.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Strong antitoxin. Stops bacteria and
viral-proofs you for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Take off the jacket.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’ll be OK.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Let’s go, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I don’t like needles.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes,
fifty-seven seconds…</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: We talked about twenty-four.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit
meeting will be over. China and the Soviet Union will go back home. The
president was on his way to the summit when his plane went down.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: He has a briefcase attached to his wrist. The
tape recording inside has to reach Hartford in 22 hours.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: What’s on it?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: You know anything about nuclear fusion?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: It’s about the survival of the human race,
Plissken. Something you don’t give a shit about.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: I’m going to inject you. It’ll sting for a
second or two…</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: That’s it, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: That idea you had about turning the Gullfire
around 180 degrees and flying off to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: What did you do to me, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: My idea, Plissken. Something we’ve been
fooling around with. Two microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.
They’re already starting to dissolve. In twenty-two hours, the cores
will completely dissolve. Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive
charge. Not a large explosive. About the size of a pinhead. Just big
enough to – open up both your arteries. I’d say you’d be dead in ten or
fifteen seconds –</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: They’re protected by the cores. Fifteen
minutes before the last hour is up we can neutralize the charge with
X-rays.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: We’ll burn out the charges IF you have the
President.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: What if I’m a little late?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: No more Hartford Summit. And no more Snake
Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: When I get back I’m going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: The Gullfire’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>ext. runway – night</strong>: Snake pulls up in a Jeep. He
walks up to the tiny plane called the Gullfire. Two guards stand by to
make sure he just gets in the plane and does his job. He throws his
cigarette out onto the runway and closes the overhead window.</p>
<p><strong>int. gullfire – night</strong>: Snake turns on his
monitors.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: 21 hours.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Suppose he’s dead, Hauk. If I come back
without him, you’ll burn these things out?</p>
<p><strong>int. base — night</strong>: Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance;
Hauk’s been expecting this question to come up.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Get them both back, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>int. gullfire – night</strong>: Snake doesn’t like the
response, but figures he can’t do anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Remember, once inside you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Oh, you mean I can’t count on you?</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ext. runway – night</strong>: A larger plane hauls the
Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is essentially a big hang
glider.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Hauk checks Snake’s life clock,
“Master Life Clock”. 20:17:43… 42… 41….</p>
<p><strong>int. gullfire – night</strong>: Snake’s watch reads 20:17:40…
39… 38… 37… 36… 35… He starts controlling the plane. He flips the tracer
open and hits the button, testing it.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: The master life clock shows the
test confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17
minutes, 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>ext. new york – night</strong>: Snake takes the plane in.</p>
<p><strong>int. gullfire – night</strong>: Snake looks over his
monitors. He sees New York coming up.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Hauk waits at his microphone.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Are you picking up the target blip?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Right on course.</p>

by a group of people. He’s armed and ready to fight.</p>
<p><strong>ext. plane crash – night</strong>: The plane is still
burning. Smoke is coming from everywhere. The plane is severed in the
middle. The crash is very impressive. Snake walks and notices a few
people go by. He pulls out his walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’m at the plane. Nobody else made it,
Hauk.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’ve got his pulse. Right up ahead, moving

<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Nothin’.</p>

<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Hey! You don’t want to walk around down
there, Snake!</p>
<p><strong>int. basement – night</strong>: The signal from the tracer
keeps getting closer and closer. Snake walks past a gang beating up and
stripping a semi-conscious girl. He doesn’t take much notice. He keeps
going. He sees a BUM sitting by a fire.</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: Hi, Chief. Nice night. Nice boots. Niiiiice
boots. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: Easy now, chief. I’m walking. I’m walking.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Mr. President . . .</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: I’m the President? Sure, I’m the President.
If I knew where I got this thing – I’d be the President.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: I woke up, and there it was, just like a
miracle . . .</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: The President’s life signs all

<p><strong>int. basement – night</strong>: Snake pulls up his
walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Hauk?!</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I’m right here, Plissken.</p>

but it’s NOT the President.</p>
<p><strong>int. basement – night</strong>: Snake holds the walkie-talkie
up to the drunk.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Hail to the chief . . . La la la la la la . .

<p><strong>snake</strong>: All right, get your machine ready. I’m coming
out.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: 18 hours, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Listen to me, Hauk. The President is DEAD,
you got that? Somebody’s had him for dinner!</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Plissken, if you get back in that glider I’ll
shoot you down. You climb out, I’ll burn you off the wall. You
understand that, Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>int. basement – night</strong>: Snake stares at his
walkie-talkie.</p>

<p><strong>ext. new york – night</strong>: Snake walks on. He’s in an
area with streetlights. He keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>ext. pod – night</strong>: Snake stares at the pod. No clues.

sits down heavily. He touches his neck. It’s like he can feel the cores
dissolving.</p>

restaurant, and runs inside. No one follows.</p>
<p><strong>int. chock full of nuts – night</strong>: Snake backs into a
corner. The floor is weak and starts to go out from under him once. He

<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: You a cop?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: No . . .</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: You’ve got a gun. You
got a smoke?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Keep your hand over it.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: It’s all right if we’re
quiet. They won’t hear us. Hey, this is a real one. You just get in?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: What’s going on out there?</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: Crazies. It’s the end of
the month. They’re out of food.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Do you live here?</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: Skulls? You kidding? I’m
with the Turks now. I just got caught in the street after dark and now
I’m stuck here all night.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: A plane crashed seven hours ago. Did you see
it?</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: You’re a cop.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’m an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: Hey, wait a minute. I
know who you are. Yeah! But I heard you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: Wow, Snake Plissken. All
right! What you doing in here with a gun, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Looking for somebody.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: The President.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: Come on! He really
here?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: When you find him, are
you gonna take him out?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: Take me out with you,
Snake.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>girl in chock full o’ nuts</strong>: I can think of lots of
reasons why . . .</p>
<p><strong>int. building – night, ext. new york – night, ext. alleys –
night</strong>: Snake runs through the building, breaks a window, and
climbs up a fire escape to get to a new floor. He breaks a window to get
in, then pulls a cabinet in front of the window. He shoots through the
cabinet, causing some crazy to scream. He busts down a door, shoots open
part of a wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down
a telephone pole. He then climbs up a wall. On the way he drops his
walkie-talkie. He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls
up.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Where you goin’, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>int. cab – night</strong>: Snake notices a tape player which
is playing the theme from “American Bandstand.”</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Bad neighborhood, Snake! You don’t want to
be walking from the Bowery to 42nd street at night! I’ve been driving a
cab here for 30 years and I’m telling you, you don’t walk around here at
night! Yes, sir! They’ll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat.
Usually I’m not down around here myself, but I wanted to catch that
show.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: This stuff is like gold around here, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cab – night</strong>: Cabbie throws the bottle into the
alley, where it explodes.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Hey, Snake, when’d you get in? I didn’t even

Eddie! Hey, hang on, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cab – night</strong>: Cabbie makes a sharp turn.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Hey, what were you doing back there,
Snake?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Looking for somebody.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Well, why didn’t you ask me? Hell, I know
everybody in this town. Yes, sir. I’ve been driving this cab for thirty
years, this very same cab.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’m GONNA ask you. Now where’s the
President?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: The Duke’s got him! Everyone knows the
Duke’s got him! You don’t have to put a gun to my head. I’ll tell
you!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Who’s the Duke?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: The DUKE! The Duke of New York! A-Number-1!
The big man, that’s who!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I want to meet this Duke.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You can’t meet the Duke, are you crazy?
Nobody wants to meet the Duke! You meet him once and then you’re
dead!</p>
<p><strong>ext. brain’s building – night</strong>: Cabbie parks the cab
and he and Snake walk up to Brain’s building.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: I hate to leave her on the street. Usually I
don’t leave her alone at all. But you’re a special case, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: It’s OK, Snake. It’s a better neighborhood.
You can relax.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Boy, they got a great place here. Like a
fortress!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: They?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: It’s me!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Who’s me?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Cabbie!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Somebody wants to see Brain, it’s important
–</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No way, Cabbie –</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: No, it’s Snake! Snake Plissken!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: YOU’RE Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: He wants to see Brain.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I want to meet the Duke.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake?
It used to be a public library. Oh, that Brain, he’s the greatest!
Mr. Fabulous! Duke loves him.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: That’s Maggie. Brain’s squeeze. The Duke
gave him to Brain just to keep him happy . . . see what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Heard you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Brain? Brain! I brought somebody to see
you!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Harold Helman.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Snake?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: “Harold”?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Where you been, Harold? It’s been a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You never told me you knew Snake Plissken,
Brain.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Isn’t that great? Hey, Brain, I could use
some gas if you can spare some . . .</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’m glad you remember me. Yeah. A man should
remember his past. Kansas City, four years ago. You ran out on me. You
left me sitting there.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: You were late.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: We were buddies, Harold. You, me, and Fresno
Bob. You know what they did to Bob?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: You want to see him sprayed all over that
map, baby? Where’s the President?!</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Swear to god, Snake, I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Don’t fuck with me!</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I want him.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Working for the man now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Then I’ll just beat it out of your squeeze
–</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Mm-hm. Maggie doesn’t know EXACTLY where he
is and unless you know EXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you’ll never find
him.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Listen, I’ll take you out of here. Yeah. Jet
glider just a couple of blocks down the street. And all you gotta do is
get me to him.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: No kidding? On the level? Will you take me,
too?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: We’ve got to deal somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: No glider.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: We’ve got the President. And the Duke’s
taking everybody out of here.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Never happen. See, I know something you and
the Duke don’t know. We’ve only got so long before Mr. President don’t
mean a whole lot.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Maybe he’s not . . .</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I know him! Look at his face, he’s lying!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Right, Harold. I’m lying. So I might as well
have some fun and keep looking by myself.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Brain –</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Talk to him, baby –</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Brain, he’ll kill us both if you don’t tell
him –</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Brain, you’ve got to tell him!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Brain, you’ve got to tell him –</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Tell him, tell him, tell him –</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: You always were smart, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Just one thing right now. Don’t call me
“Harold.”</p>
<p><strong>ext. building – night</strong>: Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and
Brain all walk out.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: So you work for this Duke, huh?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Yeah. Make gas for him. Figure out things for
him.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Like how to get across the 69th street bridge
– it’s mined, but I know where they’re planted.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: We got a diagram from a guy that got all the
way across . . . before they shot the poor bastard.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: We got a crew up there now clearing the way
across the first barricade.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: What a sight, Snake! The whole camp rolling
right across the bridge and the President right out front! Oh, that
would have been so fine . . .</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yeah, it would have been . . .</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Yeah, but we’re going with Snake now.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: That’s the Duke! I know the sound of his
engines. Don’t cross the Duke – everybody knows that.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Cabbie, you slime!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, Brain!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He’s looking for you, Brain.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: He wants my diagram of the bridge. When he
finds out I’m with you he’s going to want my life! Shit, Plissken, I
knew I shouldn’t have listened to you –</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: We’ve got to get to the President NOW, while
he’s busy.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Forget it, he’s on the other side of town and
we got no wheels. The deal is off –</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Just calm down.</p>
<p><strong>ext. car – night</strong>: A lone man sits, looking bored.
Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him out, and gets him out of the
car. He briefly considers shooting the guy on the hood of the car.
Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks around. Snake knocks him
out a second alter and then drives to get Brain and Maggie. He knocks
the other guy out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I think they saw us! Turn left, turn left
here!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Brain, this is Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I know, I know, the Duke’ll take Seventh
Avenue, Broadway is five minutes –</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Yes!!! Just keep driving!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: What’s wrong with Broadway?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Come on sweetheart . . .</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Maggie!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. trains – night</strong>: Brain points to the cars as
Snake watches.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: He’ll be in the third car from the end, by
the last campfire.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: It’s all right. He’s got to go in the front
way. It’ll take him five minutes. If you’re not back to the car in four
minutes you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: When we get there, Harold, you just keep
talking.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Hi, guys. Hi . . . how’s it going? Cooled off
a little, huh?</p>
<p><strong>head dude</strong>: What do you want, Brain?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Duke told us to wait inside. He’s on his way
here now.</p>
<p><strong>head dude</strong>: He didn’t say nothing to us about it.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Well, you can’t expect him to tell everybody
in the joint, now can you? That’s why he’s the Duke.</p>
<p><strong>head dude</strong>: Why don’t we wait outside here for
him?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Why don’t we wait inside for him?</p>
<p><strong>head dude</strong>: ’Cause I got orders, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: What are your specific orders, by the
way?</p>
<p><strong>head dude</strong>: Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to
let no one go inside.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: How’s the President holding up, by the way?
Any political discussion you’ve had with him?</p>
<p><strong>int. president’s train car – night</strong>: Two guards sit
with the President, talking. The first guard is by the President. The
second is looking out the window.</p>
<p><strong>second guard</strong>: That Brain is a real pain in the ass.
He’s always sniffing around like a dog.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: He comes up with the gas.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Are you from the outside?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Stop shaking.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I can’t! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Hauk sent me. We’ve got to move fast.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Move fast? You’re goddamned right I’ll
move fast.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>ext. train – night</strong>: Snake and the President keep
moving. Suddenly, Snake gets jumped. Ten guys surround him and the
President, and though Snake fights well, it’s not well enough. Brain
comes out with Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: They got him. Now watch him.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Friend of yours, Brain?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: He had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing I
could do.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Maggie . . .</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I said who are you?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Snake Plissken, Duke. The Man sent him in
here. Something’s going down . . . we need him.</p>

Plissken said something about a time limit.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: What time limit?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: On him.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s a lot of crap. What did I teach
you?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You… You are… the Duke of New… New York…
You’re… A-Number-One.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Get me the diagram.</p>

a bitch Plissken was telling the truth or not. God, I hate that guy.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He got in somehow.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Yeah, yeah, but how? You gotta land the
glider and take off. You can’t do it in Central Park, there’s too many
trees. Port Authority’s too low to the ground. Unless it was some…
Someplace high up. World Trade Center. That’s it. There we go. The World
Trade Center. And it’s gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to take
off than it was for him to land.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – late afternoon</strong>: Hauk reads the note left
in the briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: “Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in

<p><strong>guard</strong>: Come on, get up!</p>
<p><strong>int. stadium – sunset</strong>: Boos greet Snake as he walks
in. In the center of the room is a fighting ring. Snake climbs in, not
without effort. A huge and extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid
loud cheers. Snake notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life
clock. In the balcony above is the Duke. The Duke stands up and raises
his arms, and everyone gets silent.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They sent in their best man. And when we roll
down the 69th street bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we’re gonna
have their best man leading the way. From the neck up.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: On the hood of my car!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Let’s do it!</p>
<p><strong>int. building – sunset</strong>: Brain and Maggie walk
around. They knock on a door and Weirdo answers. He’s wearing Cabbie’s
hat.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Where’d you get the hat?</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Got it from Cabbie.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Traded him.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: What are you so nervous about?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I’m here to see the President.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Who says?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: The Duke.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: No he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Well… I’ll have to tell him you said
that.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Wait a minute. Why?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: He’s got something hidden in his clothing.
The Duke wants it.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: You’ll tell me.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Cyanide capsules. The Duke don’t want a dead
president.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Gentlemen. Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: Cyanide?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Yeah. He might try to take it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>weirdo</strong>: That’s bullshit. You’re not supposed to be
in here, Brain –</p>
<p><strong>int. tournament – sunset</strong>: Snake notices a guard
wearing the eagle tracer. A trash can lid and a bat with spikes on it is
handed to him. The next round begins.</p>
<p><strong>ext. house – evening</strong>: Brain, the President, and
Maggie sneak out. A guy in a cowboy hat notices.</p>
<p><strong>int. tournament – evening</strong>: Ugly and Snake keep
fighting. Snake is not doing very well. But he’s catching up. As Ugly
tries to hit him, he nails Ugly in the groin, then in the back of the
head. The crowd begins cheering “SNAKE! SNAKE!” The Duke can’t believe
it. Snake runs to the guard with the tracer and activates it.</p>

blinking “Tracer Status: ACTIVATED.”</p>

last second. Hauk has been stalling.</p>

move!</p>
<p><strong>int. base – evening</strong>: Two monitors show Snake’s
tracer.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: He’s approaching the World Trade Center.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I knew that son of a bitch was alive.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: He’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. world trade center – evening</strong>: Snake limps
around. He notices a cab. Fifty flights of stairs with his leg shot to
hell. He hesitates only for a second, then starts up.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – evening</strong>: The Vice President, Hauk and
Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors.</p>
<p><strong>vice president</strong>: It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: The signal only lasts for 15 minutes. Download
the choppers. We’re in a standby situation.</p>
<p><strong>vice president</strong>: Anybody could have pushed that
button.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.
Now we’ll give him a little more time, just to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>ext. world trade center – night</strong>: Snake gets out of
the elevator. Maggie, Brain, and the President all take cover behind a
chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down the glider. It
doesn’t work. The glider floats away.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Goddamned redskins! They’re savages,
Mr. President!</p>
<p><strong>int. world trade center – night</strong>: Snake has the
President by the arm and is leading everyone out.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Listen, Snake, I swear to god, I thought you
were dead –</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Yeah, you and everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: That’s your car in the lobby? The keys!
Quick! Quick! Diagram of the bridge! Hey, hey, hey –</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I’m the only one who knows how to read that,
Snake –</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Stay out of my way, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Besides, you can’t read and drive at the same
time. You need us!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: You shouldn’t have double-crossed me again,
Brain. Come on, let’s go –</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: They sawed it off…</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: The tape?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Gone… I don’t know where…</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is. Just
take us to the car and I’ll take you right to it.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Don’t talk. Breathe.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Come on, come on, we’re wasting time!</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Dead, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Here, take these.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Car trouble?</p>

<p><strong>duke</strong>: This whole deal of yours is over, Snake. You
and Brain just say good- bye to each other.</p>
<p><strong>ext. new york – night</strong>: A cab pulls up. Its radio is
playing “American Bandstand”. Guess who’s driving? You got it!</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: …and then there’s three more…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: They’re behind us –</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: They come in groups of threes!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Where’s the tape, Brain?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: What tape?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Tape…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: The tape from the briefcase!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Oh, that tape!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Here it is!</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: You traded away your hat for it!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: See, see!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Here, give me that tape!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Not just yet.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cab – night</strong>: Snake races as fast as the cab can
go.</p>
<p><strong>int. cab – night</strong>: Snake checks to make sure they’re
not being followed too closely. They’re not. The Duke is behind, but

<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Easy… easy!</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Go for it, Snake!</p>
<p><strong>ext. 69th street bridge – night</strong>: Snake jumps the car
over the first obstacle. Cabbie looks like he’s having a heart
attack.</p>
<p><strong>int. cab – night</strong>: Brain reads the map. Cabbie
continues to freak out.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You’ve got to slow down a little, Snake…</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I think there are three mines ahead,
Snake.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You think?!</p>
<p><strong>ext. 69th street bridge – night</strong>: The Duke continues
in pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog
right when I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You’re pushing her too hard, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 69th street bridge – night</strong>: The cab explodes,
being cut right in half. Everyone makes it except Cabbie. Cabbie had
been driving that very same cab for thirty years. He died with it.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: I said JOG RIGHT!… you asshole.</p>
<p><strong>brain</strong>: Stay to the right, stay to the right, now jog
left. Hold it, left… left… LEFT, DAMMIT!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Brain…</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Keep moving…</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Maggie… he’s dead. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>int. base – night</strong>: Rehme runs up to Hauk and the
Vice President.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Station 19! They spotted two cars on the 69th
street bridge.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Is it Plissken?</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: Taxicab and a Cadillac. Taxi hit a mine.
There’s four people on foot.</p>
<p><strong>vice president</strong>: Fourteen minutes…</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: Strombaerden! Get over to Station 19. They’re
coming across the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 69th street bridge – night</strong>: The President and
Snake run on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wall – night</strong>: A jeep pulls up. Rehme’s voice
comes up over the loudspeaker. The guards on the jeep ready the
winch.</p>

standby situation. Repeat. We are in a standby situation. All
helicopters, down. Wall guard, do not fire on prisoners. Repeat, do not
fire on prisoners. All vehicles, stand by. Repeat, stand by.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 69th street bridge – night</strong>: Snake and the
President are close enough to the wall to hear all this.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wall – night</strong>: The wall guards grab the rope and
prepare to lower it for the President and Snake.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 69th street bridge – night</strong>: Snake pushes the
President up to the wall. The winch comes down and Snake helps the
President into it first. The President goes up and over. Snake’s life
clock reads 1:32. But he doesn’t have time to watch seconds tick away
because the Duke is right behind him firing at him. Snake ducks for
cover. The wall guards die. The winch comes down again, and the Duke
sees it. He starts toward it. Snake tackles him and beats him up, dazing
him but not knocking him out. He grabs the winch.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wall – night</strong>: A hand stops the winch from
moving.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 69th street bridge – night</strong>: Snake comes to a
stop. He panics and starts pulling on the winch line. The Duke comes to
and stands up. But he can’t get anywhere because the President has found
a machine gun and is now firing away. He is very accurate. He nails the
Duke right away but keeps firing.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yeah, hey, Number One! You’re the Duke!
You’re the Duke!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You’re… the Duke… You’re
A-Number-One.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wall – night</strong>: Hauk and the medic pull up with

<p><strong>hauk</strong>: The tape, Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. president’s press conference site – night</strong>: A
jeep pulls Rehme up. He jogs to the President, who is being shaved and
prepared for broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>rehme</strong>: I radioed ahead, Mr. President. They know the
situation. They’re waiting for your broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Oh, it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I, uh… I want to thank you. Anything you
want… you just name it.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: Just a moment of your time.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Three minutes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: We did get you out. A lot of people died in
the process. I just wondered how you felt about it.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I want to thank them. This nation
appreciates their sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Look, uh, I’m on the air in… Two and a
half minutes?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base – night</strong>: Snake walks away. Hauk stands
nearby. Snake stops in his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: You going to kill me now, Snake?</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: I’m too tired. Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>hauk</strong>: I’ve got another deal for you. I want you to
think it over while you’re resting. I want to give you a job. We’d make
one hell of a team, Snake.</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: The name’s Plissken.</p>
<p><strong>ext. president’s press conference site – night</strong>: The
President looks suitably freshened up. He’s even smiling a little.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: You’re on camera, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Good evening. Although I shall not be
present at this historic summit meeting, I present this, in the hope
that our great nations may learn to live in peace.</p>
<p><strong>ext. base – night</strong>: Snake keeps limping. He pulls a
tape out of his pocket, yanks the magnetic tape out, winds it around his
hand, rips it to shreds, and throws the tape away.</p>
