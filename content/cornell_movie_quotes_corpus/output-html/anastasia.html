. .</p>
<p><strong>serebreakov</strong>: I want her.</p>
<p><strong>phlegmenkof</strong>: That’s horrible, skinny thing?! She’s

Home is where you belong and none of us belong here.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: Where is your home, Anya?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m not sure but look. . .</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: It says “Together in Paris”. I was wearing
this when I came here ten years ago - it’s the only way that I know . .
.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: . . . that I must have been someone someone
loved.</p>
<p><strong>chubby girl</strong>: Is your home in Paris?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: It might be. I have to go and find out.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I have to go now, before it gets light.</p>
<p><strong>gregor</strong>: But what if we can’t ever find where we came
from?!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Then you’ll have to make your own home. Lots
of people do.</p>

<p><strong>peasant 1, 2, &amp; 3</strong>: In our beloved Soviet
Union!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Very good. . .</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Is this the right line to get papers to
travel?</p>
<p><strong>peasant 4</strong>: Travel? Travel to where?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: To Paris. I have to get to Paris</p>
<p><strong>peasant 5</strong>: Paris?! What do they have in Paris that
they don’t have here?</p>
<p><strong>peasant 6</strong>: Shorter lines?!</p>
<p><strong>peasant 7</strong>: Nobody leaves Soviet Russia.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Is this where I get traveling papers?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: It would be if we let you travel which we
don’t so it isn’t. Russia is the people’s paradise!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: See Dmitri. He can help.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: But you didn’t hear it from me.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I didn’t</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri? There must be a million Dmitris. .
.</p>
<p><strong>peasant 9</strong>: Which line is this?</p>
<p><strong>peasant 10</strong>: The line to get into the line.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Excuse me, do you know Dmitri. . .</p>
<p><strong>peasant 9</strong>: I know nothing!</p>
<p><strong>peasant 10</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>peasants 9 &amp; 10</strong>: Try the tavern/ library.</p>
<p><strong>peasants9&amp; 10</strong>: But we didn’t tell you!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I wish they’d all stop telling me they didn’t
tell me!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: What are you doing. . .</p>
<p><strong>tiny husband</strong>: Could you get rid of her
moustache?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Excuse me - I’m looking for a man named
Dmitri. . .</p>
<p><strong>artist</strong>: But I didn’t write it.</p>
<p><strong>actress 1</strong>: Oh, Grandmama! It’s me, Anastasia! I’ve
waited so long to see you!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Dmitri! I can not work with her!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: May I remind you that you are supposed to
be Princess - not a lazy lumbering lout!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Vladimir, calm down!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: This, my friend, as an exercise in
futility! We shall never find a girl to play the Princess Anastasia out
of this motley crew of commoners!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: For a ten million rubles reward we can look
a little longer. This is the big one. . . and all I need is the right
girl.</p>
<p><strong>actress 2</strong>: Oh, Grandmama! It’s me, Anastasia. I’ve
waited so long to see you.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>actress 3</strong>: Oh. . . Grandmama it’s me. Anastasia, I
have waited so long, too. See you!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>actress 4</strong>: Oh. . . Grandmama. . . It’s me. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I wouldn’t be on the outside anymore. The
ten million rubles would make me welcome anywhere. I’d really belong
somewhere - if I could just find the right girl.</p>
<p><strong>actress 5</strong>: Oh, Grandmama. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>actress 6</strong>: What’s my modivation?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Stanislavski!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>actress 7</strong>: Oh. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I’ve gotta find the right girl!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: It’s no use, Dmitri - we’ll never find the
right girl!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: We will. We have to. Come on, Vlad - she’s
out there.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: She could be right under our nose</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Ouch! That really hurt!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m sorry. . . I’m. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: That’s quite a hard head you’ve got there,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m looking for Dmitri. I need traveling
papers - to Paris. I heard Dmitri could help me.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Who did you hear it from?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I heard it from everyone who said I didn’t
hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Providing travel papers is illeagal! I
know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you. Providded you have enough
money to pay for this service. . .</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Well, I don’t have any money . . .</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Good day!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I have a bike! Perhaps I could sell it and. .
.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: What are you doing here? And where’s my
bike?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Officer! My bike has been stolen!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Nonsense. There is no crime in the Soviet
Socialist Republic.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Sorry, boy, I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: No. You can’t come with me. I’m leaving. .
.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: It sounds like you’re saying “me too”. Listen
little guy, I have money, no food. . . and no bicycle. I’m the last
person you should be following!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: . . . even if we find her, what makes you
think the Empress will even see us?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: She’ll see us.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: You, uhh. . . hang here often? “Hang” get
it? I said “hang” and we’re both, you know, cause we’re bats. . . and,
uhhh. . . what’s your sign?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: That was your dinner! I do hope there is
no cabbage in Paris!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Whatta’ ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a
bug to eat. Get it? A “bug” to eat, ’cause we’re. . .</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: I’m a Gemini. . .</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: What are you do. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: You’re trespassing, boy!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I. . . I. . . spoke to you earlier about
traveling paper. .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: It’s her.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: He’s her?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Are you Dmitri? I didn’t mean to trespass - I
don’t want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me.
. .</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to
find a girl and. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: She doesn’t want to do anything “dishonest”.
. .</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Ew. . . the honest type.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You look like her. Like the Princess
Anastasia. Has anyone ever told you that before?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly
told me I looked like a princess! Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: People say Anastasia was the only member of
the Royal Family to escape alive. That makes her an orphan too</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What happened to your parents?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I don’t know - I don’t remember anything that
happened before the revolution. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You know, it’s strange - Anastasia’s
grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia
since the revolution. Why do you think she wouldn’t go to her own
grandmother?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t see what this has to do
with me.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Perhaps it’s because she has amnesia too -
can’t remember. . .</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: How much do you weigh?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: I was just wondering since we already have
the dress. . .</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Look, I came here to get papers to travel to
Paris and. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Why do you want to go to Paris?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I have my reasons.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Anastasia’s grandmother is in Paris. We’re
going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: And I think you are the Princess
Anastasia.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You never thought of the possibility?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Look - there isn’t an orphan in the world who
doesn’t dream she’s a princess but, come on. . . Look at me!</p>
<p><strong>her!</strong>: It could be you.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You don’t have anything to lose. If I am
wrong - the Empress will simply tell us you aren’t Anastasia and we’ll
be on our way. No harm done - an honest mistake - but at least you will
be in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Find out the truth - come to Paris with
us.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: All right. I will go with you.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: The Her Royal Highness Princess
Anastasia!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Oy. . . he’s gonna be so mad. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Find out the truth - come to Paris with
us.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: All right. I will go with you.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: The Her Royal Highness Princess
Anastasia!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Oy. . . he’s gonna be so mad…</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Ummm … Father Gregori? It’s, uhh … me.
Bartok. Phew! Not home …</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Oh my God! Don’t do that … feel my heart. Go
ahead. I’m dying here …</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: And what do you want, my little
rat-with-wings?</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Name calling! That’s mature.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: I gave you that tongue and I can rip it
out!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: No, I really like my tongue… we’re very
attached. Oyyyy… Okay, now… promise you won’t get angry.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Why would I ever be angry with you, little
friend?</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Yeah, right. Keep that thought okay? So, I’m
in town, stop by the old palace. You get a better class of bats there -
no tattoos or anything.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: So, I’m cruisin’ the rafters and… what can I
say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk,
you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn’t get invited to
a plague. Someone’s gotta clean that up…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Get to the point sometime tonight.. I’m
late for a wenching.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Okay… you’re not gonna like this but, well,
it looks like Anastasia is … still alive.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Impossible. That rumor’s been around for
years.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Trust me, it’s her!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Rodent’s intuition, how do I know? She looks
exactly like her. Except she’s taller, which is natural … Of course my
second cousin Treplev - he never grew. Looks like a little pepper
shaker. He was so cute …</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Oyyy… I knew this was gonna to upset
him!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Source of my power. Owner of my soul. I
need your help.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Hey, she’s just a kid. And she’s going to
Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: I cursed then all!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest
bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always
said “Curses were made to be broken”. Course, she said it in those
irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn’t quite so profound…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore
to destroy all of them! If she lives, if she should have a child
someday, the Romanov Family continues! And I won’t lot that happen! THIS
IS THE END OF THE LINE!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: You know, this is really obsessive behavior.
There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he
feels. . .</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Yesses - you’d all like to get out,
wouldn’ t you? Sorry just one at a time and only when I call.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Do you have any idea what would happen if
that broke?!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: You’d lose your security deposit?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Evil, powerful beings - I have their power
only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at
once… well …</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Where is she? Where is Princess
Anastasia…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: She has friends. No matter…</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Ohhh, that was dumb…</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Hello, I’ve get really terrible
claustrophobia. That’s why I could never live in a cave …</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Finish my prophecy…</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Ew, I hate when he does this!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: She is not to get off that train…
alive!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Go! I don’t care what you do with the
others but finish the girl! KILLLLL HERRRRR! And have fun…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Take her away, Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Haven’t anything better to do than to break
my heart.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: No more. So more…</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Oh, oh… I must say. I thought that one was
bar - i’m just so shocked that she wasn’t real well, she was real, I
mean she was human, of course. but not our real. I must say, even my
sisters were touched by her yes - yes they were…</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: … moved to tears of joy! We won’t be f ooled
next time, girls! I’m a going to think of really hard questions…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: No, Sophie. My heart can’t take it anymore!
I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Hurry up with those papers.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Would you have leaned over Rembrant’s
shoulder and told him to paint faster?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: You probably would. They’re still wet.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Wake up, young lady, that’s our train.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: “Wake up, your highness” - we should start
getting used to saying it.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: What a world - a man who was in my
position in society is calling a peasant ’Your Highness”.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>vladimer</strong>: We have a lot of work to do…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Take my hand!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Do you always punch people first thing in
the morning?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Sorry - it’s a reflex. Living in an orphanage
if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I wasn’t bothering you. I was trying to wake
you up!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: By pulling my hair?!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I was all out of dynamite!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Put it on your nose. For heaven’s sake, you’re
making such a fuss!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Men are such babies…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Here, let me</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You’re a princess…</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Royalty do not help people with their
luggage.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Well, she certainly has a mind of her
own.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Yes. And I hate that in a woman.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Papers!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: It’s what I hate about this government -
everything in red!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Thank you, Comrade Zhivago.</p>
<p><strong>zhivago</strong>: Doctor Zhivago.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Pray he’s color-blind…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: wait here.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m going to stretch my legs</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: That’s a good idea - a great idea - stretch
your legs … stretch then that way.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I must have hit him harder than I thought…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: That’s them! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Wait here!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Would you like to tell what we are…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Come on up!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Just what do you think you’re doing?!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Trying… to… breathe…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: The guards! I’ll explain later.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Forged papers! Now, what?!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Now just get off the train.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Noooo….</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: She’s quite right, Dmitri, a man of my
stature should not have to</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Come on, we’ll jump together… Take my
hand.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: I think I have hurt my…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You must enjoy causing me pain!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You shouldn’t have pushed us!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Is everyone all right?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: She’s fine! I may never walk right again,
but she’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Well, I better got goin’. Got a busy day
letting all the blood rush to my head…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: She’s too far away, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Yesss… our power is much stronger when
were near. We must get close to her.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Oy… not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you
know that.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: You’re absolutely right. Travel broadens
your horizons…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: We’ll catch her and finish her! We ride
this night!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Well, we wait this night!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: No have a lot of work to do, Anya! Come
along, Meetoo!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: We have to prepare you for an audience
with Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Who’s Sophie?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Ah … the Lady Sophie… The ravishing first
cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you
are the Princess before we’ll be granted a meeting with the Empress …
your grandmother, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You never said anything to me about having to
prove I’m a Princess!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You are the Princess.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: We’re just going to refresh your
memory…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I don’t have a memory and I’m not a Princess!
Even if I were - no one’s ever going to believe it. I’m not exactly…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: … good enough… I can’t go through with
this!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: See? The Princess is under there …</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Ah! Let us begin!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: You were born on the Adriatic sea at the
summer palace, where the parties and the buffets were marvelous ….</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: …and on my father’s side, there was</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Every Russian family has one..</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called
her Nashie Fooshie!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Did I tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You must have.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: …fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: It’s the best fork of all</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: The dessert fork!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Ah, yes … I have always loved that
fork…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: What a beautiful ship!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: It used to be a private yacht before the
government took it over.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Oh, yes it was the seagoing vessel of
elaborate elegance in entertaining… A party boat. It once belonged to
…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Konstantin Petrovich of Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>elderly dowager</strong>: No, no, boys! You don’t know where
he’s been!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: No! I look ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Come out! I can do alterations.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You’ll laugh.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: I shant!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Not you. Him.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I won’t laugh - I swear…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You said you wouldn’t laugh!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: It’s not you - it’s the dress!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m never going to be..</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Well! Maybe I am…</p>
<p><strong>on deck</strong>: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully
down the deck in spite of the ship’s rocking motion. Dmitri and Vlad
can’t even stand due to the motion. Anya looks back and flashes them a
smile.</p>
<p><strong>in their cabin</strong>: Dmitri gets out of the bed he’s been
sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where Anya is sleeping
peacefully, to close the port hole against a cold wind. He closes is and
see’s Anya - she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her covers
and she SLUGS him.</p>
<p><strong>under a table</strong>: Meetoo is walking around sniffing
feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY PUG DOGS who growl at
him. He runs away and finally see’s a woman’s foot and a pair of pretty
feminine shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo grabs them
in his mouth and runs.</p>
<p><strong>on deck</strong>: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the
heeled shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling like mad.
Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement. Anya turns to them.</p>
<p><strong>on deck</strong>: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the
woman’s shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him with great
vindication.</p>
<p><strong>ballroom</strong>: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and
graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir’s arm and completes a perfect
curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri applauds and moves down to her as she
stands and smacks him with her head accidently.</p>
<p><strong>their cabin</strong>: Vladimir is directing Anya as she
waltzes gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is directed
to join Anya. He does and they dance together, with Anya clearly
leading. The boat sways to the left and Anya is thrown closer into
Dmitri’s arms. Neither of them even try to readjust.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: You are a natural! I don’t know how you
ever learned to dance that well! That must have been some high class
orphanage …</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I wanted to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: It’s so beautiful … and sad.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Sad?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Yeah … well, yours. You still don’t believe
that you’re the Princess, do you?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I know I must have had something to do with
the palace - I’ve had little flashes of things - but being the Princess?
It doesn’t matter as long as I find my home.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Well, the only thing you’ve got when you’ve
got a home is a fear of losing it! You’re lucky you don’t remember the
revolution – I never had much, but what I did have – I lost.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Hey! It doesn’t matter! You gotta make your
own way in the world! Don’t be sorry for me! I’m going to get what I
want don’t you worry!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: She’s out there …</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: I’m getting a chest cold..</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Bartok… a question.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: I’m getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel
my forehead…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: What do you think is the most humiliating
way to die?</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some
dental problems - you didn’t want to watch him eat, let’s put it that
way…</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: … anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging
in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not
the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was
fine for awhile until it started ringing … Ewwww, what a mess …</p>
<p><strong>rasputtn</strong>: Show her to me …</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: And it didn’t help the tonal quality of the
bell, either.</p>
<p><strong>yellow eyes, fifty blood red mouths and thousands of
sharp</strong>: TEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM.</p>
<p><strong>reality</strong>: Anya has climbed over the railing of the
deck and is looking into the black ocean… smiling.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: If you have to go - wake her..</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What were you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: It’s okay now - I’ve got you. You’re
safe…</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Boy, don’t you hate it when that
happens?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: She leads a charmed life, that little one
… Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the
train and now … it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Nice looking fellow. I mean, don’t get me
wrong - I’m not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just …</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: You are toying with me, aren’t you? You
let me get so close…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Bartok … have you ever been to Paris?</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try
and fly after one of those heavy sauces?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: We are going to Paris - and while we’re
there, let’s kill the young man. He annoys me.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Oh! I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: It’s okay. Didn’t hurt..</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m almost there… I’m finally going to
know…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: How is our current financial status?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: If I used the word “bleak” I would be
optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: The “Odessa Dunk”?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: It worked in Odessa…</p>
<p><strong>elderly dowager</strong>: Help! My little dogs! Chevalier!
Maurice! Hold on, darlings!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I’ll save them, Madame</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Such bravery! Why, that man should be
rewarded! Amply rewarded!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: That was really very kind of you.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: I won’t say a word…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Yes - If I can’t convince Sophie, I’ll never
be able to see Tatiana….</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You’ll convince her. You have the qualities
of a princess you’re poised and strong… and beautiful … even if you
forget a couple dates of family names - she’ll know.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: May I present her Royal Highness Princess
Anastasia!</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Oh good! We haven’t seen an Anastasia in
several days!</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I’d just like to ask you a few questions,
dear…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Where were you born?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: The real Anastasia couldn’t have grown up to
be lovelier.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: This is the hard one … what rare treat was
served on the night of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Romanov
Dynasty? The last ball they ever had?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Father had fresh tropical fruits sent in.
Oranges and pineapples from the far east. I remember … I remember I
threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a table…</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Yes … yes, it was fresh fruit. Well, maybe
not “fresh” Estelle got one rather brown banana but …</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Are you impressed with our Anastasia?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Then, you’ll take her to see Tatiana?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Oh, heavens I must say… no, no actually, I
can’t - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Perhaps you could convince her?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Oh, heavens, no… but … She is going to be at
the Ballet Russe tonight! That’s the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian,
oh those crazy French… they only go to see which dancers will
defect.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Come my dear, we’ve much to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: We did it! We did it, my boy! We’re going
to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we’re going to be rich!
Rich!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: But it’s not the money, Vlad.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Are you feeling all right?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: But you never doubted who I was, did you,
Dmitri? Not for a second …</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Life is funny, isn’t it. You find the
right girl … and then you lose her.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Dmitri … You must understand that once you
take her to Tatiana… well, it’s over… nothing can happen between you.
She’s a princess and you’re a commoner.</p>
<p><strong>accordion player</strong>: Lovers!</p>
<p><strong>flower seller</strong>: Ooh la la!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Sorry, it’s just… you know I saw these
french postcards once and… ooh la la … well, I’m not sure about the
“ooh”, but it’s the “la la” I’m really lookin’ forward to… Right, I’m
shutting up.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: We’re close to her, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Excited, eh? You look about to burst …
You’d like to burst, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: No, no, no. We made a bargain. Someday
you’ll have me for all eternity. Till then… I’m in charge.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: What do you think? Is it me?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Compliments of Sophie. Her escort has to
look his best.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Look. There is your grandmother…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: She’s so beautiful! I do remember her … I
remember her …</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Come on. It’s time..</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m so scared…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Don’t be</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I need to speak with the Dowager Empress
…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: How much pain will you inflict on an old
woman for money?!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Please, if you’d just listen…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Remove him at once.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Please! Empress! It’s not what you ….</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Anya. . . please. . .</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Anya, wait!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Tell me it isn’t true?! Tell me you didn’t do
this for the money!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: No! Well, yes, but</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a
lie!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Sir! Your rear tire is flat!</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: it is?</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Ulo! Slow down!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I’m not Ulo and I won’t slow down. But you
will listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: You! How dare you?! Stop this car
immediately!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Stop this car!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Please don’t be afraid! I’m sorry, but there
was no other way!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Anastasia’s music box… She had this all
these years… You could have found it…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What I foundyour was your granddaughter!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You were right - it was a lie. My intention
was to fool you I am a liar - but I found the truth. Just see her! I
swear if you see her I’ll disappear forever</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Just look! Just look at her!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Who are you, child?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I don’t know! I don’t want to hurt you…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Do you remember this?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I remember something lost … I’m so confused!
Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have…
belonged to you …</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Oh! Where did you get that?!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’ve always had it… I came here because of
this! Tell me if you recognize it! Please! It’s all I have…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: It was hers … my Anastasia’s … If this is
part of your scheme! If you found it or stole - I don’t care, I’ll give
you whatever you want just TELL ME</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: He is gonna yellllll.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: I should have been a dentist …</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: … and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made
that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn’t hurt
her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not
everything.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Don’t worry about that now, child, it will
all come back to you now that you’re home…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: My poor child you’re safe, now… you’re home
…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Yesss … finally “home”. And what a
charming … girlish little home it is. Look, Bartok, little angels, the
symbol of … love. So sweet, so harmless.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Let’s go for a touch of irony, shall
we?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: And there will be no blood on my hands
…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Nooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Anastasia! It was just a bat! It’s gone,
dear…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: No, it wasn’t a bat! I saw this horrible man -
I remember him, I think…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: No, no child… shush… it’s all right …</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: A grand ball for the Princess. How very
exciting. So much to do, so little time…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Do it somewhere else, please. Quietly.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Caterers … invitations … saber dancers! We
must have saber dancers!</p>
<p><strong>pierre</strong>: Her head it is … how you say?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Beeg. Zat is how you say it. Beeg.</p>
<p><strong>pierre</strong>: And the crown she is … how you say?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Small! Zat is “how you say” it! Don’t be so
French, Pierre wit the “how you say” all za time - zat is really
annoying.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: You are going to make a beautiful
princess.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Lovely… What troubles you, child?</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Madame, your… eh… guest has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Thank you, Vladimir.,</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Anya… Anastasia… I’m sorry … We didn’t
mean to hurt you …</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: I sent for you because I owe you a debt of
gratitude larger than I can ever repay</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: No. Empress, you –</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: I want you to have the reward money -
you’ve earned it.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Empress, no! I will not take the money! I
just came to tell you I was sorry…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Young man, I…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: … and I’m going to keep my promise to stay
out of your lives, forever.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: You are the boy …</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I should go</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: That last night in the palace… one boy
showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives,
weren’t you? Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Promise me she’ll have her home.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: She does.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: And tell me that she’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I’m glad you found what you were looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m glad you did too.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Enjoy your fortune.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: But this invitation came from the Empress
herself! It’s the social event of the decade! You can’t turn it
down!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: So where will you go?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: She found her home. Maybe it’s time I found
one too!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: So. You don’t want to go to the
coronation, eh?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Rasputin!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: I know, I know … you thought I was dead.
That’s how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all
of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead
when you expected him to be.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: What do you want?!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: The same thing I wanted ten years ago -
all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with
that nuisance, Anastasia…</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: You’re insane! You didn’t kill the Romonovs
- it was the…</p>
<p><strong>stop it! i did so kill them!</strong>: And I’m going to kill
Anastasia.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Look at me… Look at me!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: You are going to help me kill her… You are
going to help me kill her… her…</p>
<p><strong>major domo</strong>: … then as I say “Her Serene Highness
Princess Anastasia” you, your Highness, should walk out on to the stage
and greet your …</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: I believe her highness understands what she
has to do.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Don’t you, child?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do
you understand the choice you must make.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: There’s no choice…</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Your “guest” is unable to attend.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad -
look at him!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Yes, your highness.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Poor Meetoo!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Yes, your highness.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Cut it out, Vlad! I’m not angry with you
anymore - I know how much you needed the money.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: But they didn’t take the money - either one
of them. I offered it to them, but they both refused.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri didn’t want the money?</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: No, he just wanted to know you were
happy.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Fortunately, I am to be married. With your
highness, permission.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Vlad, stop acting this way! You’re my
friend!</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: No. From now on I am your loyal subject …
your highness. By your leave?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Why does everyone have to act that way?</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: You’ll have to become used to it, child, if
you accept the crown…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: “If” I accept?! Of course I’m going to accept!
it’s what I always wanted!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Is it? Is this what you want?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did.
I came back to my home with you.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: You can’t go back to find your home. Your
home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: And this is my future. This is who I am!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: This is who you were. Exactly who you are
is up to you.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I don’t know who I am! I still don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Yes, you do. You do.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: And in your heart, you know what is right
for you.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’ve spent my whole life waiting to find you
…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: And we have found each other nothing will
ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your
home.</p>
<p><strong>major domo</strong>: Her Serene Highness, the Princess
Anastasia!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Anya!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Anya …</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Look, Bartok. Most of them were there the
night I made this curse. Now, they’ll get to see it finished! Revenge is
a dish best served… in front of a larrrrrge audience!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Do not despair. I’ll make sure your
beloved princess drops in.</p>
<p><strong>bartok</strong>: Ahh, very witty. There’s this English guy -
Noel Coward - I’ll bet he’s quaking …</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri … Grandmama told me.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Throw her off the edge! Do it!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri … Look at me! It’s Anya! It’s ANYA!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You saved my life in the palace! You won’t
take it now…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri. I know you would never hurt me. You
love me.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Dmitri?</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Anya… where are we?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I guess you aren’t as powerful as you
thought!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: I’ll show you!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Run, Anya - go…</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m not leaving you!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Fighting for fair lady. How noble…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: And how pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: That’s only going to make you fall
farther.</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Anya!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri pov</strong>: Rasputin’s large boots above him,
heading for the edge.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: My curse is now complete! Good-bye,
babushka!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Take my hand! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Don’t let me go!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: I’ll never let go!</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: What a touching sentiment…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: This little piggy had a palace… this
little piggy had a throne…</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: This little piggy missed the firing
squad..</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: And this little piggy wanted a home… And
this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way… down!</p>
<p><strong>dmitri</strong>: Come on… I’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I am home.</p>
