<h1 id="the-road">the-road</h1>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Why are you taking a bath?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m not. The WOMAN takes off her nightdress
and goes to the bath.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: You’ll sleep better. He looks at her,
surprised she’s misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m not! Put your clothes back on. She sees
he’s looking out the window now - there’s an eery rose-colored glow of
distant fire through the glass - and distant shouts and screams…</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: What is it? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa? Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Shh. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it, Papa? They listen as it grows
NEARER and LOUDER, everything SHAKING, tree roots GROANING and
SPLITTING, until it passes between them with a ROAR like a subway train
right beneath them. The BOY is now clinging to the MAN and crying, his
head buried against his chest in fear.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Shh. It’s all right. It’s all right. It’s
gone.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What was it, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It was an earthquake.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: The clocks stopped at one seventeen one
morning. There was a long shear of bright light, then a series of low
concussions.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Within a year there were fires on the ridges
and deranged chanting. The screams of the murdered. By day the dead
impaled on spikes along the road.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I think it’s October but I can’t be sure. I
haven’t kept a calender for 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Each day is more gray than the one before.
Each night is darker - beyond darkness. The world gets colder week by
week as the planet slowly dies. No animals have survived. All the crops
are long gone.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Someday all the trees in the world will have
fallen.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: The roads are peopled by refugees towing carts
and road gangs carrying weapons, looking for fuel and food.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There has been cannibalism. Cannibalism is the
great fear.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Mostly I worry about food. Always food. Food
and our shoes. CU - the BOY examines the head of a moose mounted on a
wall in a SEARS hunting store.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Sometimes I tell the boy old stories of
courage and justice - difficult as they are to remember. All I know is
the child is my warrant and if he is not the word of God, then God never
spoke.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Now you can read me a story. He gets out a
BOOK and looks at the pictures in the lamplight. The MAN reads him a
story…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It’s snowing!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s like it used to be when the sun came out.
The BOY catches the snowflake in his hand, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t know. The MAN looks through a pair of
BINOCULARS and sees: A stooped figure up ahead, a DYING MAN dragging one
leg slightly, limping along. He stops and stands uncertainly, then
continues. The BOY sees him too.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What should we do Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’re all right. Let’s just follow and
watch.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yeah. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As they pass by the DYING MAN looks
down, averting his eyes. The BOY keeps looking, unable to take his eyes
off him.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa, what’s wrong with that man?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He’s been struck by lightning.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can’t we help him? Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. We can’t help him. They keep walking away
and the BOY tugs at the MAN’s coat.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can’t we help him, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. We can’t. There’s nothing to be done for
him.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There’s nothing we could have done. He’s going
to die. We can’t share what we have or we’ll die too.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: So when are you going to talk to me again?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m talking now.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Let’s take a look. The man picks up the
revolver and they go inside cautiously.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t look. The BOY looks at the ground.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You don’t need to see this. The BOY takes a
few steps, exploring, he eyes the empty hay loft but avoids looking at
the hanged bodies.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: There could be something here. There could be
corn or something.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No, they ran out of food.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Maybe we could find some hayseeds in the
hayloft? Now the BOY goes over to the swinging CORPSES, oddly
curious.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s not what-you think. They committed
suicide.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You know what that means. The MAN GOES outside
while the BOY thinks about it a moment.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come here. The BOY goes over and the MAN takes
out his revolver, opens the magazine and shows him: two bullets in the
chamber.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You see that? Two left. One for you and one
for me. He places the BOY’s thumb on the hammer and cocks the pistol. He
curls the BOY’s index finger around the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You put it in your mouth and point it up. Like
this. Just like I showed you. He puts the barrel of the pistol in his
own mouth until the BOY nods, wide eyed. He takes the pistol out of his
mouth and uncocks it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You got it?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I think.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Is it okay?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Okay. The MAN puts the gun away and cuddles
the BOY close. They set off again.</p>
<p><strong>sees:</strong>: POV WOMAN - water and blood running down her
legs.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Oh no. Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s okay, I’ll help you. Just like we
said.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: No no no…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’ll heat water. We can do it. As he goes out
she MOANS in despair.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: We don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Well, I think we probably do.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: What kind of life is this?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s life. It’s the only thing left. He takes
the WOMAN back into the other room.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You promised not to do that.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You know what, Papa. I have to watch you all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I know I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: If you break little promises you’ll break big
ones. That’s what you said.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN relents, pouring the hot water
back into the pan and taking some of the BOY’s cocoa into his own cup.
The BOY wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and
licks his finger.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Watch your finger.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You always say that.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: That’s because you always do it. The MAN
spreads bits of a worn out road map on the boards and studies them.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We have to keep moving. We have to go south to
the coast.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’ll be better at the coast.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Because we’re going to freeze here. He picks
up the map pieces carefully.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Do you remember your alphabet?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Can you read that?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Good, let’s go. The MAN takes out a large
REVOLVER, cocks it in readiness and places it on the tarp as they move.
The BOY eyes the MAN nervously, eyes the gun and they move off.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I can’t, I just can’t…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There’s no other way.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We could go over.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We can’t take the cart over.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We don’t know what’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There’s nothing in there. It’s just the same
as it is out here. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Okay. The boy sticks close to the MAN’s side.
The man has the revolver in his belt now and his parka unzipped, ready
as they nervously walk towards the mouth of the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just remember that the things you put into
your head are forever.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: But you forget some things don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You forget what you want to remember and you
remember what you want to forget.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: POV MAN - Exiting the tunnel, shuffling
through the ash, a group of HOODED MEN, some in gas masks and filthy
biohazard suits, slouching along, coughing, casting their heads from
side to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe - a ROAD GANG. The
MAN listens to the sound of a DIESEL TRUCK behind the gang.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Quickly. Quick… The BOY jolts awake as the MAN
shoves his pistol in his belt, grabs the boy by the hand. They slide out
of the car and crouch on the ground, the BOY is frozen with fear.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s all right. It’s all right but we have to
run. Don’t look back. Come on. Their backpacks are still left in the
back of the car…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Run… run… The flat bed truck RUMBLES into
view, MEN from the GANG standing on the flat bed looking around, some
holding rifles. The BOY falls and the MAN pulls him to his feet with
such force he lifts him clean off the ground and has to dangle him back
down again.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You okay? It’s all right… come on… They rush
down the embankment into the trees alongside the turnpike.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN sees one of the GANG MEMBERS
coming down the embankment, unbuckling his belt. He is emaciated, in
dirty blue overalls and a gas company cap, and has a long beard cut
square at the bottom and a bad tattoo of a bird on his neck. He doesn’t
stop, just keeps coming, closer and closer until he’s just feet away,
almost on top of them. He unzips his pants and takes a piss. As he
stands pissing his eyes roam around - at any moment he could look to the
side and see them crouching there. The MAN is wide-eyed, gun ready, eyes
darting from the GANG MEMBER to the BOY to the GUN. The GANG MEMBER
rolls his shoulders and exercises his neck… he looks down and studies
the steam coming off his piss. The MAN silently trains his pistol at the
head of the GANG MEMBER who, as if by instinct, rolls his head around
and looks right at him.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just keep it coming. The GANG MEMBER sees the
gun and stops pissing, looks back at the truck, zips his fly.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t look at them. Look at me. If you call
out you’re dead. Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: Does it matter? Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What’s the truck running on?</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: Diesel fuel.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Where d’you get that?</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You don’t know, huh? The GANG MEMBER just
stares, not answering.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You got ammunition for those rifles? The GANG
MEMBER looks back towards the truck.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I told you not to look back there. Where d’you
get all that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: Found it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What are you eating?</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: Whatever we can find.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Whatever you can find, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: Yeah… Now the GANG MEMBER looks at the
BOY, causing the MAN To raise the revolver and cock it. POV GANG MEMBER
- he looks down the barrel at the magazine and sees empty space.</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: You won’t shoot that thing. You ain’t
got but two shells. Maybe just one. And they’ll hear the shot. On the
over pass the ROAD GANG are looking around, MURMURING as they notice one
of their number missing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Maybe. But you won’t. It’ll be through your
skull and inside your brain before you can hear it. The MAN steps closer
and aims the gun at the MAN’s forehead, hammer back, ready.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: To hear it you’ll need a frontal lobe and
things with names like colliculus and temporal gyrus and you won’t have
them anymore because they’ll just be soup.</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: Are you a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m not anything anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: We got a hurt man. It’d be worth your
while. The MAN glances in the direction of the ROAD GANG, then back at
the GANG MEMBER, who is still eyeing the BOY. The BOY is sitting with
his hands on top of his head, peeking out through his arms, terrified as
the tension escalates.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: If you look at him again I’ll shoot you in the
head.</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: I’ll bet that boy is hungry. Why don’t
you all just come onto the truck. Get something to eat. Ain’t no need to
be such a hard ass.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You don’t have anything to eat. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: I ain’t going nowheres.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You think I won’t kill you but you’re
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>gang member.</strong>: You know what I think? I think you’re
chickenshit. You never killed a man in your life. He drops his belt on
the ground with a CLATTER, a canteen and army pouch hanging from it. The
MAN eyes the army pouch, eyes the GANG on the road - and notices for the
first time some of them are wearing the same army pouches.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: One is banging his stick on the side of
the truck to call their lost member. The MAN is distracted by this and
when he looks up the GANG MEMBER has taken two silent steps and is
standing between him and the BOY, holding a knife.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What do you think you’re going to do with
that? Without a word the GANG MEMBER dives and grabs the BOY, rolls and
lands on his feet holding the BOY against his chest with his knife at
his throat. Simultaneously the MAN drops to his knees, trains the pistol
and fires from six feet away, shooting the GANG MEMBER in the forehead.
He falls back and lies with blood bubbling from the wound, eyes open,
the BOY lying in his lap in shock, deafened, expressionless, covered
with gore and mute as a stone. The GANG hear the loud SHOT and freeze,
they start looking around them more urgently now. The MAN grabs the
dazed BOY by the hand and yells but in his deafness the BOY hears only a
MUTED soup of words:</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Move! Let’s go! The MAN shoves the pistol in
his belt, hoists the BOY onto his shoulders and sets off down the road
at a run.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come on. Get up, get up quickly! The MAN swings
the BOY onto his shoulders and runs.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Shh. It’s okay now. You’re going to be OK. POV
BOY - the BOY can still HEAR nothing, temporarily deaf. But he sees the
MAN talking and looking around, through 360 degrees, trying to work out
where it’s safe to go.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come on. He grabs the BOY’s hand and they take
off again.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s okay… it’s okay now… Frightened by the
BOY’s muteness, he wraps him in a blanket, unzips his parka and holds
him close under the parka. The MAN picks up his revolver, checks the
chamber, only one bullet left. He eyes the flickering shadows in the
distance and then eyes the BOY, making minute calculations of distance,
calibrating the space between the ROAD GANG and the BOY. He holds the
revolver up and cocks it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I try to look like any common traveling killer
but my heart is hammering. When it comes to the boy I have only one
question: Can you do it? When the time comes? There is no moon, but not
far away, perhaps 30 yards, a firey TORCH makes its way through the
woods. About 50 yards away from that another TORCH is being used to
search… shadows flicker ominously. The sounds of TWIGS snapping
underfoot and BRANCHES being broken as the ROAD GANG searches
wordlessly, just BREATHING heavily through their masks and beards. The
MAN clutches the BOY tighter, and stifles a cough. They remain frozen
like this, unable to budge.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s no use crying. You have to talk to me. He
takes the blanket and dries the BOY’s hair as he talks.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m not going to let anything happen to you…
I’m going to take care of you… I’m always going to try and be here for
you… and I’m going to kill anybody who touches you. He smooths the BOY’s
hair down with shaking fingers, clumsily trying to brush it out of his
eyes, a fatherly instinct to make the BOY neat.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Because that’s my job. Do you understand? When
he’s through the MAN lifts the BOY’s thin arms, puts a vest over his
head, then a ragged sweater, then he folds the BOY into his parka, zips
it up to the neck and kisses him on the top of the head. The MAN grabs
his knapsack, tips it upside down, rummages inside - it’s empty.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come on, we need to get the cart back.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BOY stumbles along behind, slower,
fatigued, makingthe MAN anxious. The MAN leaves the boy hiding:</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Wait here. He starts to climb the embankment
and hears: little running FOOTSTEPS as the BOY comes after him, he turns
to face the BOY urgently, exasperated.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No I need you to wait. I’ll hear you if you
call. I’ll just be a little ways and I’ll be able to hear you if you get
scared and you call me and I’ll come right away. He walks off but hears…
the little BOY’s FOOTSTEPS running after him again - he turns
around.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I said wait! The BOY’s face crinkles up and a
tear rolls down.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Stop it. I need you to do what I say. Take the
gun. The BOY freezes, refusing to take the gun.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just take it will you? The BOY shakes his
head.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We don’t have time for this. We need our food.
What’s left. The MAN shoves the gun into the BOY’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t argue. He creeps up the embankment. The
BOY just stares at the revolver.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Their backpacks lie open on the ground,
next to the cart on it’s side, it’s contents spilled out, mostly
plundered, just a few children’s BOOKS and TOYS, old pots and pans,
shoes and ragged clothing remaining. Nearby are the remains of a large
campfire in the middle of the turnpike. The man collects up the few
remaining possessions and puts them into the backpacks. POV MAN - he
sees charred billets of wood, ash and… the bones of the shot ROAD GANG
MEMBER. Nearby is a pool of his blood and guts, still gently STEAMING,
the head decapitated and rolled under a car. He nudges the bones with
the toe of his shoe.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Let’s get out of here. The freeway’s too
dangerous. Find the back roads.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: That’s all that’s left. I should have done
it when there were more bullets in the gun. The MAN shuts his eyes,
unable to take it. In the corner, the BOY is standing in the background,
drawing on the walls.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Sooner or later - no listen - they will
catch up with us and they will kill us. They will rape me -</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: And they will rape him</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Please no - just - no</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: They are going to rape us and kill us and
eat us and you won’t face it. You’d rather wait for it to happen.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’ll do anything.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Such as what? She picks up the revolver and
puts the TWO BULLETS into the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: I thought about not even telling you. Just
doing it. I’d empty every godamn bullet into my brain and leave you with
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t say that. Don’t talk this way.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: There’s nothing left to talk about… my heart
was ripped out of me the night he was born…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Please don’t do this. I won’t let anything
happen. We’ll survive.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: I don’t want to survive! I’d take him with
me if it weren’t for you. You know I would. Why can’t you face it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Will you listen? You’re talking</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: It’s not crazy and you know it. It’s the
right thing to do. They glance at the BOY.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Other families do it. She goes to the BOY,
strokes his hair, kisses him, makes a reassuring display of being
motherly.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Time for bed, there’s a good boy. She picks
him up in her arms and carries him off to bed.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it? The MAN looks at the BOY,
surprised he’s talking again.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s a waterfall.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Look. Colors.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There used to be color everywhere. You don’t
remember. It was before you were born. There used to be so many thnings…
The BOY approaches the water’s edge, shallow and clear with gravel and
pebbles sparkling at the bottom. He scoops up some water, surprised that
it seems clean.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Look. It’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Do you want to go in?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Is it okay?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just don’t swallow any. The MAN unzips his
parka and slips it to the ground. The BOY eyes the MAN, surprised - then
does the same.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Listen. That man back there… there’s not many
good guys left, that’s all. We have to watch out for the bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: And we have to talk. Always. We have to just…
you know… keep carrying the fire…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What fire?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: The fire inside you. The BOY is thoughtful a
minute, and then:</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Are we still the good guys?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes. We’re still the good guys.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: And we always will be no matter what happens?
He eyes the BOY uncertainly, unsure if he can promise this.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Always will be. Yeah. The MAN goes back to
tying the tarp.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We have to keep moving. Other people might be
attracted to the waterfall just like we were. We wouldn’t hear them
coming. They stop to look at a lake surrounded by fog down in the</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you think there could be fish in the
lake?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. There’s nothing in the lake. They move
on.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come up here.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I know. So am I.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Are we going to die?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. Sometime. Not now.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: And we’re still going south?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: So we’ll be warm?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: And there might be food there?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Everything depends on reaching the coast.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Okay. The MAN draws a blanket around him and
kisses him goodnight, it is now pitch black.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I wish I was with my mom. They are silent a
moment, until:</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You mean you wish you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You mustn’t say that. It’s a bad thing to
say.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I know but you have to. You have to stop
thinking about her. We both do.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: How do I do that? The MAN is silent, lost in
thought.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: She was gone, and the coldness of it was her
final gift… she died somewhere in the dark… there is no other tale to
tell. He lays everything out on the grey slushy ground, then flings the
wallet into the river and walks back to camp, leaving the PHOTO and
cards to blow away.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Will you tell him goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: No. I won’t. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Will you at least wait till morning? Stay with
me through the night.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: No. I have to go now. They kiss again, she
turns and walks away out of the yard.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What am I going to tell him? What are we going
to do without you?</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: You should move south. You won’t survive
another winter here. The MAN follows a few steps and she stops and turns
to him.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Why won’t you help me?</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: I can’t help you. Don’t you understand? This
is how I’m helping you.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Where are you going to go? You can’t even
see.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: I don’t need to see.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Please don’t. Please. The MAN stares. She
goes, vanishing into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Who are they, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What if it’s more bad guys?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It won’t be more bad guys. Don’t worry. Stay
close. He takes hold of the gun and they walk in a different direction
now, giving the high rises a wide berth.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Keep low. We’ll be okay. When they get to the
end of the block they stop and the MAN checks around the corner before
they cross the street. In the distance three men appear, emaciated,
slow-moving. They step forward, stop and watch the BOY and the MAN.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I think we should take a look.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There’s nothing to be scared of.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You want to stay here?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No. The BOY joins him and they set off slowly
up the drive, through patches of melting snow. There is a tall dead
privet fence with a deserted birdsnest in it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There’s a reason this is locked.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BOY is now panicky, hopping about,
close to tears.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Don’t open it - don’t!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I need something to pry it open.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No! The MAN goes out abruptly and the BOY
follows, wringing his hands in fear.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Listen to me. Just stop it. We’re starving. Do
you understand? I have to do this. I don’t have any choice. The MAN
opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just wait here.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Okay. Just stay close to me. Nothing’s going
to happen.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They descend the rough wooden steps.</p>
<p><strong>reveal:</strong>: Huddled against the wall, all trying to
hide, shielding their shining eyes from the light, NAKED MEN and WOMEN,
thin as skeletons like inmates in a death camp. The BOY jumps, shocked
and the MAN freezes, staring, dumb struck by: On a mattress on the floor
lies a NAKED MAN with his legs gone to the hip, their stumps blackened
and burned, cauterized. The BOY covers his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Jesus… The MAN on the MATTRESS turns to them
and WHISPERS, a low indistinct murmur at first.</p>
<p><strong>man on mattress.</strong>: Help us… please help us…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Christ… oh Christ… The others join in, an
eerie chorus of WHISPERING, “Help us… please help us…” The MAN turns and
grabs the BOY and rushes for the steps.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Hurry… go… move! The MAN drops the lighter as
he tries to push the BOY up the steps. Out of nowhere a BEARDED FACE
appears at the foot of the stairs, blinking.</p>
<p><strong>bearded face.</strong>: Please… they’re taking us to the
smoke house.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BEARDED FACE reaches out and feebly
tries to grab the MAN’s arm but he breaks free and concentrates on
getting the BOY up the steps, following in a blind panic, fumbling and
missing his footing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Hurry - hurry! They scramble up the steps
towards the light of the hatch as the BEARDED FACE reaches out and tries
one last time to grab at the MAN’s feet but he kicks free.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Christ. Run! The BOY is near the window,
dancing up and down in terror, pointing out the window to:</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Run. Run!</p>
<p><strong>well fed woman.</strong>: I’m going to freshen up.</p>
<p><strong>bearded man.</strong>: I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>well fed woman 2.</strong>: I’m going up to change. He hears
one of the WOMEN STOMPING across the old floorboards and up the stairs
to change while the other WOMAN takes a few steps towards the rest room,
then turns back towards the window as the conversation lurches on.</p>
<p><strong>bearded man 2.</strong>: Who left this window open?</p>
<p><strong>well fed woman.</strong>: I leave it open for the smell.</p>
<p><strong>bearded man 2.</strong>: What smell?</p>
<p><strong>well fed woman.</strong>: You don’t smell it anymore?</p>
<p><strong>bearded man.</strong>: Who wants a drink?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They hear the sound of the WINDOW BEING
CLOSED and LATCHED. As all this goes on, the MAN is frozen, eyes wide
with fear, he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his
haunches so he’s close to the BOY, desperate, unable to decide what to
do, unable to think straight with fear. The BOY is staring from the door
to the pistol to the bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling
somewhat.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Bad guys… bad men…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Shh, shh… There are FOOT STEPS outside the
door as the WELL FED PEOPLE drift closer and then away again. The man
starts to cough but he has the revolver in one hand and the BOY’s hand
in his other. The MAN tries to stifle his cough but can’t. Then the BOY
notices and holds his own small hand to the MAN’s mouth, stifling his
coughing as the talk goes on outside:</p>
<p><strong>well fed woman.</strong>: Will you help me with the dirty
dishes?</p>
<p><strong>bearded man 2.</strong>: I’m hungry. As the coughing subsides
a little the MAN takes the BOY’s hand from his mouth and pushes the
revolver into it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Take it. The BOY tries to resist, shaking his
head, terrified, mute.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Take it. The MAN puts his left arm around the
BOY’s tiny, thin shoulders and holds him close.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t be afraid. If they get hold of you,
you’re going to have to do it just like everybody else. Do you
understand? Shh. No crying. Do you hear me? The WOMAN turns from the
window and one of the BEARDED MEN pours whiskey and hands her one.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BOY is weeping and shaking his head
as the MAN shows him again what to do with the gun.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Stop crying. You have to be a brave boy. You
know how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Say “Yes I do Papa.” He stares down at the
little BOY who just holds the gun feebly… he realises the BOY won’t use
it. After a moment of torturous contemplation, the MAN very gently takes
the gun from the BOY’s hand and the BOY sits forlornly, staring down at
his hands, afraid to look at the MAN now. When the BOY looks up again he
is staring down the barrel of the pistol, the MAN aiming the large
revolver at the BOY’s forehead.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What are you doing? The MAN’s hand shakes, his
thumb trembles on the hammer as he cocks it…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Will I see you again? When will I see you? The
MAN’s finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly squeezes it… At that
moment there’s a loud THUMP from the kitchen and the WELL FED PEOPLE
stop and listen, then rush through to the kitchen, and immediately
there’s a commotion as they see the state of the hatch with the table
over it.</p>
<p><strong>bearded man 2</strong>: What the fuck do you think you’re
doing? Huh? What the fuck do you think you’re doing…?</p>
<p><strong>well fed woman</strong>: Don’t look at me like that. What are
you doing?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN gathers his wits and opens the
door a crack.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Follow me, take my hand, don’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come on, keep running! They rush across the
road to the woods on the other side, the BOY ahead as the MAN checks
behind them. The MAN looks back towards the house and two of the
WELL-FED PEOPLE have come outside, looking around suspiciously. He hits
the ground and takes the BOY with him, they lie flat at the edge of the
woods and the road. They are wildly out of breath, chests heaving, the
MAN coughing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Keep your head down. POV MAN - the WELL-FED
PEOPLE walk a few steps down the drive and a BEARDED MAN looks through
BINOCULARS at the road and the woods, but not directly at the MAN and
the BOY hiding. The WELL FED PEOPLE start looking around the side of the
house, walking away. The MAN and the BOY get up, dash through the
treeline and disappear into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’ll be safe soon.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: They’re going to eat those people aren’t they,
Papa? The MAN does not answer.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa? Papa, we wouldn’t ever eat anybody would
we?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No matter how hungry we were. Even if we were
starving?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’re starving now.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Because, because we’re the good guys?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: And we’re carrying the fire.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes. The MAN takes the BOY in his arms. In a
moment the BOY starts blinking sleepily and drifts off to sleep and the
MAN strokes the sleeping BOY’s hair and kisses him on the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come on. There’s nobody here.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What is it, papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s a treat for you. Here. Sit down. He helps
the little BOY off with his knapsack and sits him down and opens the can
of COKE ceremoniously. The BOY looks startled and sniffs the fizzing can
as if it’s the strangest thing he’s ever seen in his life.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Go ahead. The BOY takes the can.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It’s bubbly.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Go ahead. Drink it. The BOY takes a sip and
considers.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It’s really good. You have some, papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. I want you to drink it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: But I want you to have some. The MAN
reluctantly takes the can and has a tiny sip, hands it back to the wary
BOY.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It’s because I’ll never get to drink another
one, isn’t it? The MAN doesn’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I didn’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t hear anything. They listen more until,
very faintly we hear a DOG BARK in the distance. The BOY turns around
180 degrees to listen, alert with anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s a dog.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: A dog! Where did it come from?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t know. Come on. The MAN walks across
the road, past the apartments and the BOY follows, bouncing up and down,
over-excited now.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We’re not going to kill it are we Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What? No, we’re not going to kill it. Why did
you say that?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You still got one bullet left.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’re not going to hurt the dog, I promise.
We’re not going to kill it and we’re not going to eat it either.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Maybe it’ll eat us!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I doubt it very much.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can we look for it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s gone, okay?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I used to watch the ball games here with my
father.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is this place, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s the house where I grew up. They go up to
the house - clapboards have been removed for firewood leaving studs and
insulation exposed. The BOY stops, reluctant to go further, and the MAN
takes a few more steps then turns around to check on him.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t you want to see where I grew up?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: There might be somebody in there.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There’s nobody there now. The MAN takes the
BOY’s hand and they approach a basketball hoop by the garage. The MAN is
momentarily overcome with emotion as he recalls the details, but it
doesn’t mean much to the BOY. After a moment the MAN goes up the steps -
frightened, but horribly compelled at the same time. The BOY follows
nervously.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’ve got to find something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m not hungry. I’m not! The MAN takes his
revolver from his belt and approaches the front door, warily pushing it
open.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’ll be all right. Come on. He goes through
the front door - the BOY stays where he is, rigid with fear. The BOY
notices a stuffed toy dog in the window, staring out at the garden and
his curiosity takes over. The BOY goes inside carefully.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: This is where we used to have Christmas when I
was a boy. We’d hang our stockings right here. The MAN examines the
yellow tiled surround. The BOY watches the MAN as if he’s gone mad.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: My mother scrubbed these every day. It’s still
spotless. Much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped
and taken for firewood - there are gaping holes. By the fireplace is a
small pile of bones - and–in the grid are more burnt bones and the skull
from the family cat. The MAN takes it all in sadly but the BOY is
unmoved.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa? I don’t think we should do this.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You want to wait outside? The BOY nods
vigorously.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: All right. He takes the BOY’s hand and leads
him out.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Sit here on the stoop and don’t go away. The
BOY sits quietly and the MAN goes back inside. After a moment he starts
going through his knapsack, less afraid now.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: In the light small black fish
hook-shaped spores drift from the top of the jar to the bottom. He
replaces the lid, appalled.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Stop - stop! The MAN freezes, then charges
out.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: POV BOY - peeping around the side of the
house is the other SMALL BOY, the same age, similarly grimy and thin,
wearing an outsize woollen coat. The other SMALL BOY disappears down the
side and the BOY runs after him.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Wait! Come back! I won’t hurt you!</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Where are you?! The MAN comes sprinting up the
side of the house and seizes him by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What are you doing? What the hell are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: There’s a little boy, Papa, I saw a little
boy.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: There’s no little boy. What’s the matter with
you?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes there is! I saw him! A boy just like me.
The MAN takes the BOY by the arm and drags him back through the yard, up
the side of the house, the BOY resisting, crying and looking back all
the way.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Why? Why can’t I go and see him?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I need to see him! I need to!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I just do! The BOY has gone limp, weeping
bitterly, resisting being moved. The MAN gives up and squats beside the
sobbing BOY.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Okay, I’m sorry. I understand. He holds him,
wipes his tears from his cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa? Will there be other boys like me at the
coast?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I hope so. The MAN goes to the car, wipes
thick dust from the windscreen and peers in - it’s empty.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I got you something The MAN produces from his
pocket one of the tiny hard brown apples and holds it up to the
remaining light.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s an apple.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He hands it to the boy who examines it
curiously. The MAN takes out a pocket knife, takes the apple back, cuts
the apple in half to reveal a woody brown interior. They regard the
mahogany apple uncertainly, the MAN is the first to take a bite, with
some difficulty. The BOY bites his half and makes a face.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Suck it a while and it’ll soften. They sit
sucking and chewing the ancient apple.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Did you ever have any friends? The MAN eyes
the BOY - curious at the sudden question.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes. I did.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Lots of them?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you remember them?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes. I remember all of them…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: They died.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: All of them?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes. All of them.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He yearns for his own friends and imagines how
things will be different at the coast - and that there will be other
children there… .When I have nothing else, I try to dream the dreams of
a child’s imaginings…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you know where we are Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I think we’re about two hundred miles from the
coast. As the crow flies.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: “As the crow flies?”</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It means, going in a straight line. POV MAN -
In the background, something catches his eye and he</p>
<p><strong>focuses on:</strong>: A frieze of HUMAN HEADS, dried with
taut grins and shrunken eyes, perched on wooden poles. Some are tattooed
with targets and runic slogans. Some are skinless, with signs and words
inked onto them. One has suture marks etched on it, like a blue print
for assembly.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: There aren’t any crows are there? Just in
books.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yeah, just in books… The MAN stares at the
heads as the BOY continues his conversation, distracted and not seeing
the heads.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you think there might be crows
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: But what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I think it’s unlikely… They keep walking and
talking, the MAN grim-faced but the BOY intent on what’s ahead.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Could they fly to Mars or some place?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No, they couldn’t fly to Mars…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Because it’s too far?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes. The MAN discretely hurries the BOY on
with a guiding hand towards the woods and off the road.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What if they tried and-and-and they just got
halfway or something and then they were too tired? Would they fall back
down…?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We can’t go back on the road.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Why, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I think someone’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BOY stares at the tracks. The MAN
stares in both directions, examining the road in the distance. He moves
a few paces and notices tied to a dead sapling a thin red neckerchief.
He takes a few steps and through a gap in the trees sees a clearing -
snow and a mass of BLOOD RED FOOTPRINTS, the icy snow stained blood red
like a sorbet. A killing floor.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Will they see our tracks?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’ll cover them. The MAN moves the BOY away
and kicks snow over their tracks - then lays fresh ones going in several
different directions. The BOY copies him, leaving his own maze of
tracks. They run off keeping parallel with the road but staying off it.
POV MAN - in the distance TWO FIGURES appear on the road.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Here they come. The MAN now looks over his
shoulder for a good look, then grabs the BOY’s hand and takes off.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What are we going to do? No answer.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Move! Quickly! He tries to get the BOY to his
feet but he is limp, staring around blearily, exhausted. They hear
another loud WHUMP. Then the GROAN of timber and another WHUMP as trees
start to keel over around them. The MAN grabs the BOY and runs as best
he can through the snow and falling trees. They have abandoned their
blankets, tarp and backpacks.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just keep moving, run! They rush through the
woods as more and more trees fall one after the other, WHUMP, WHUMP,
WHUMP, great loads of snow falling from limbs to the ground with a BOOM,
setting the woods shuddering. The BOY is getting bogged in the snow and
the MAN stoops and scoops up the BOY and they cram themselves under a
fat fallen tree to shield themselves.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: That’s all there is, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: There’s nothing left anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. They sit eating raisins, saying nothing
until they’re finished.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Are we going to die now? The MAN just looks at
the BOY, then looks away.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What do you think is going to happen? We’re
just going to suddenly keel over and die? It takes a long time to die of
starvation. The important thing is water to stop you dehydrating. We’ve
got water. We’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Every day is a lie. But I am slowly dying.
That is not a lie .I am trying to prepare him for the day when I am
gone. He takes hold of the lower hem of the blanket and tows it off the
bed, revealing a desiccated corpse. He ignores it, shaking the blanket
out and folding it under his arm. He notices the BOY at his side,
watching wide-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Nothing you haven’t seen before. They go
out.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa! The MAN draws his pistol and goes out,
alert again.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It’s us.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BOY stares at his reflection - he
looks like an alien, skinny with giant staring eyes on shaky legs.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We look skinny.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We are skinny. The MAN puts the blanket around
the BOY’s shoulders. He notices an old upright piano, covered in ash and
dust. The BOY stares as he goes to it, lifts the lid and plays a chord.
The BOY’s eyes light up and he is magnetized, instantly coming over and
waiting for the next note. The MAN plays another chord.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s a piano.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: For making music. This… is music. Your mother
played very well.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Before you were born. We had one just like it.
It was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Chopped it up for firewood. He stares into
space, slumps suddenly, overcome with emotion as he remembers:</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The WOMAN stands at the piano and tries
to play. She plays for a moment and the MAN cracks a rare smile - the
piano is out of tune and she stops. She plays a bit more but soon starts
to bang the keys atonally in frustration. The MAN just lets her get on
with it until she’s spent.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: I used to worry what would happen if there
was a fire. What would I save? What could I bear to lose? There used to
be so many things, so many beautiful things. Things people made. Things
nature made. Who knew we would lose it all?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’ll strip the floorboards.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: You can’t live without a floor.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You can’t live without a piano. She starts to
dismantle the piano, opening the lid, taking it off it’s hinges, it’s
heavy, she hands him the heavy lid and he reluctantly dumps it on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: It’s my piano.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I bought it for you.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: It needs tuning. Who’s going to tune it? Can
you tune it? They look at each other sadly. They take the front piece
away and dump that. The WOMAN picks up the axe and hands it to the MAN.
He swings it at the frame.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He is so engrossed he hasn’t noticed the
BOY standing a few feet away, watching with saucer eyes, scared.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Don’t open it, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Please, Papa, please.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No it’s not! What if there’s people hiding
down there? The MAN ignores him, focussed as he chops the plywood around
the lock, gets the spade under a corner and levers the door open. The
BOY has his fists bunched up to his chest, bobbing up and down with
fear. The MAN starts to descend a hand made wooden stair case in the
bunker. He takes another disposable lighter from his pocket, gives the
child a kiss on the forehead and then disappears into the bunker,
leaving the worried BOY staring after him. The BOY looks around at the
deserted yard as the evening draws in, now even more frightened.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Oh my God… oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come down. Oh my God come down. The BOY is in
the hole and down the steps like lightning.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa? What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Everything. I found everything.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Stored in the bunker are crate upon
crate of canned goods: tomatoes, peaches, beans, apricots, canned ham,
corned beef, hundreds of gallons of water in ferry cans and in boxes
paper towels, toilet paper and trash bags stuffed with blankets. The MAN
takes the BOY’s hand and helps him down, then goes back up the steps and
draws the door shut and jams a pair of metal pliers through the heavy
inside hasp to stop the door being opened. He goes back down the steps
to the BOY and holds up a candle to illuminate the shelves.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Can you see?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s food! Can you read the labels? The BOY
stares at the brightly colored packaging, he’s never seen anything like
it before. The MAN hands the BOY a tin.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: “Pears.” It says “pears.”</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes! It does! Oh yes it does! Pears! They
inspect the shelves: chilli, corn, stew, soup, spaghetti sauce, the
BOY’s eyes are like saucers.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Is it real?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Oh yes, it’s real all right. The MAN pulls a
box of butane lighters from the shelf and tests one, it doesn’t work. He
tests another which works, it has a large flame - he uses it to read the
labels.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Why is it here?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Because someone thought it might be
needed.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: But they died.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes. What would you like for breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Pears.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Pears it is. The MAN claws open a box and
pulls out a tin of pears. He gets paper bowls from a stack, plastic
forks and spoons, lays them out. He finds a camping lamp. He puts a
butane cannister in and lights up the lamp. He finds a can opener and
opens the pears while the BOY watches silently, wrapping a blanket
around himself and sitting on the soft bunk bed.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Is it okay for us to take it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: They’d want us to. The MAN dishes up two bowls
of pears and they sit side by side on the bunk with spoons and
pears.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: These will be the best pears you ever tasted.
The best. You just wait. They eat in silence. They lick the spoons and
drink the syrup from the bowls. The MAN feels inside his mouth with his
fingers - the sugar irritating a sore tooth.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Too sweet. The BOY smiles, amused, and the MAN
opens another tin.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN brings the pan over and forks
over chunks of ham onto the pates, then spoonsfull of scrambled eggs
from a second pan, then baked beans from a small pot. The BOY just
stares, as if drugged, uncomprehending, the food alien to him.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Go ahead. Don’t let it get cold.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What do I eat first?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Whatever you like. The BOY eats a hunk of ham
as the MAN pours coffee.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Is this coffee?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: That’s right. Careful it’s hot. He hands him
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We did good, didn’t we Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yeah, we did good.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: POV MAN - an eccentric, childlike
drawing of the WOMAN, skinny like a stick figure but, inexplicably, with
a brightly smiling face and big laughing eyes, labelled simply “mom” in
spidery scrawl. Stirring classical music fades up and into:</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Don’t touch my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Nice and warm. He washes the BOY’s hair,
lathing water over him with the pot. He has a sudden thought:</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: You could grow potatoes in these ears…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Weird. Won’t you be cold?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BOY has a towel around his shoulders
and long locks of hair decorate it. The MAN finishes, takes the towel
off, wipes the BOY’s neck and face with a flannel, holds up a mirror for
the BOY to see.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I look funny.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can I try some?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. You won’t like it. Makes you feel funny.
The BOY stares, curious, wanting it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You think I come from another world, don’t
you? Filled with all these strange things you’ve never seen.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Well, I do I guess.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Maybe it’s a dog.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s not a dog.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It is! It’s a dog! A dog! The MAN listens
anxiously as the pawing and scratching continues, the wood over the
bunker amplifying the noise. He cocks the revolver and positions himself
under the hatch, ready.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: If it’s a dog it’ll be with someone.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t know. After a torturous moment the
sounds die away.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m not waiting to find out. Come on. Let’s
get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t want to go.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I know but it’s not safe anymore. The MAN
grabs his gun and cocks it, rushes about turning out all the lamps, and
they sit anxiously in the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What are we going to do with all this
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’ll just have to take what we can.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I wish we could live here. And we could keep
the dog and the dog could catch food for us.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Look, there is no dog, okay? I’m sorry but
there just isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Well what is it!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t know what it is!</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Please Papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Just say it’s going to be all right, Papa. Say
it. Just say it, please. The MAN doesn’t know what to say, losing
patience.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Listen, trouble comes when you least expect
it. So maybe the thing to do is to just always expect it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you always expect it? Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I do, yes.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You always think bad things are going to
happen but we found this place. Maybe we’ll find another place like this
at the coast.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Maybe. The MAN dumps the carton of food on the
floor and packs another, organising jerry cans of water.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’ll have to cover our tracks from now on.
The MAN drags the old mattress back over the entrance to the bunker. He
carefully covers the surrounding area with debris.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I think they’re following us.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You think it’s bad guys?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What if it’s good guys?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t think we’re likely to meet any good
guys for a while. We have to be careful now. We’ve got food.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I don’t have anything for you. You can
look if you want. I got nothing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’re not robbers. The OLD MAN leans an ear
forward, deaf.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I said we’re not robbers.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: What are you?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’re just like you.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: What are you following me for?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’re not following you.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We’ve got food we could give him.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He’s not getting any food. The OLD MAN looks
away, avoiding their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: He’s scared, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Everybody’s scared.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Please Papa.</p>
<p><strong>all right1</strong>: The MAN eyes the road to the left and
right, then draws his revolver.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: If this is an ambush, he goes first. He goes
out to the trolley and rummages in it while the BOY and the OLD MAN
stare at each other. The MAN comes back with a tin of fruit cocktail and
a tin opener and opens it and hands it to the BOY. The BOY places the
tin of fruit on the road in front of the OLD MAN.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Take it. Here. The OLD MAN doesn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What about a spoon?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He’s not getting a spoon. The BOY urges him
on, miming with his hands, as if feeding a raccoon.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Eat it. It’s good. The OLD MAN picks up the
tin and his filthy long nails CLATTER on the tin as he tips it to his
mouth, the juice running down his chin, his head jerking as he
swallows.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Look, Papa. He’s hungry.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I see it. And I know what you’re going to ask
me. And the answer is No.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What’s the question?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We can’t keep him. They watch him eating
painfully slowly. The OLD MAN finishes and sits down in the road holding
the tin, staring at it, as if it might refill.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: When did you last eat? The OLD MAN just
stares.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Do you want to eat with us?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I don’t know. What do I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Tell us where the world went.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You don’t have to do anything. Can you walk
okay? They help the OLD MAN off the road and hand him his cane but he
pushes it away.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I can walk. They walk off the road towards
the dead, blackened woods.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t hold his hand.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: He can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t. The trio walk into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I’m ninety.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Ninety my ass! Is that what you tell people?
So they don’t hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Does it work?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: Ely.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just “Ely?”</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: What’s wrong with “Ely?”</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: How come you’re still alive? What do you
eat?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I don’t know. People give you things.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I didn’t. He did. The OLD MAN eyes the BOY,
closely, half blind.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: Are you a little boy?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What does he look like?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I don’t know. I can’t see real good.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Is that right? Can you see me?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: No. But I can tell somebody’s there.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Okay. You need to sleep. Come on. He gathers up
the BOY and takes him a few feet away, settles him down in blankets
while the OLD MAN stares into the fire.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I had a little boy once. Gone… all
gone…</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I can’t… I can’t talk about that…
leastways not with you I can’t. When the MAN returns he has his gun
which he surreptitiously places on the ground in full view of the OLD
MAN.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You can see that, right? Okay. Tell me now.
You’re not a shill for a pack of road agents?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I’m not anything. I’ll go if you want me
to. I can find the road. The MAN stares at the OLD MAN cynically but the
OLD MAN just stares back blankly.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I live like an animal. You don’t want to
know the things I’ve had to eat. When I saw that boy I thought I’d died
and he was an angel. I never thought I’d see a child again. I never
thought that would happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He is an angel. To me he’s a God.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: Well I hope that’s not true. To be on the
road with the last surviving God would be a pretty frightening
experience.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: Where men can’t live, Gods can’t either.
The road gangs would tear you limb from limb, both of you. The low
RUMBLE in the earth is heard again, an earthquake, this time in the
distance. They listen a moment.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I knew this was coming. This or something
like it.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: There were warnings. People thought it was
a con - I always believed in it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Did you try to get ready for it?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: No. What would you do? Even if you knew
what to do you wouldn’t know what to do. Suppose you were the last man
left alive?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: How would you know if you were the last man
alive?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: I don’t guess you would know it. You’d
just be it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Maybe God would know.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: If there is a God up there he would have
turned his back on us by now. Whoever made humanity will find no
humanity here. The MAN pours hot water into mugs to make coffee, hands
one to the OLD MAN. They drink.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Do you ever wish you would die?</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: No. It’s foolish to ask for luxuries in
times like these.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: You should thank him you know. I wouldn’t have
given you anything.</p>
<p><strong>old man.</strong>: Maybe I should and maybe I shouldn’t. I
wouldn’t have given you anything. The OLD MAN looks around, orientating
himself, and goes, tapping his cane, without a glance back at the BOY or
the MAN. The MAN gives the BOY a reproachful look and the BOY looks
defiant for the first time, a new distance between them.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: He’s going to die and you don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I care enough. Maybe when we’re out of food
you’ll have more time to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You always say watch out for bad guys but that
old man wasn’t a bad guy and you can’t even tell anymore.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I had a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t want to tell you. Just you.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What happened to me? The BOY’s face crinkles
up, he starts to sob. The MAN coughs again and the BOY shoots out a
hand, puts it over the MAN’s mouth to staunch the coughing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I tell him: When you dream about bad things
happening it shows you’re still fighting. You’re still alive. It’s when
you start to dream about good things you should start to worry.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you think they’re still following us?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I think they’ve been following us for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>boy-.</strong>: Maybe it’s Ely - the old man?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: How? On a broom stick?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The BOY thinks about this for a moment
as they approach the railway line.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: More smoke. I think we should take a look.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t want to. Let’s just keep going.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Whoever it is I don’t want them behind us.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What if they’re bad guys?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What if they’re good guys? They look at each
other, a stalemate. The MAN stands and starts to pack up the tarp.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Look. Whoever it is out there, it’s better to
know about it than to not know.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Because we don’t like surprises. Surprises are
scary.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: They could sneak up on us further down the
road. You need to learn this. The MAN folds the tarp and sleeping
blankets and starts heading down the slope to the trolley, the BOY
following.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You know where we are?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Where do you think? The BOY points to a place
on the map.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. We’re closer than you think. He takes the
crayon and points on the map.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: This is us. This is all sea.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Is it blue?</p>
<p><strong>man-.</strong>: The sea? I don’t know. It used to be.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN picks up a desiccated pine cone
from the ground, and stares at it, hollow-eyed, hungry. He squeezes it
and it crumbles to dust. He takes a few steps, sniffing the air.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Can you smell that?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It smells different.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Everything is going to be different.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m sorry it’s not blue.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What’s on the other side?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: There must be something.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Maybe there’s a father and his little boy and
they’re sitting on the beach too.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: And they could be carrying the fire too?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: They could be, yes. The MAN sees the BOY’s
hopefulness reappearing and strokes his head, his heart breaking for
him.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What are our long term goals?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: “What are our long term goals?” Where did you
hear that?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know. You said it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: A long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: When your mother was here?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: And what was the answer?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Well, I don’t either. They stare at the water
- charred, quotidian household objects rolling back and forth in the
surf.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can I go swimming?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Swimming? You’ll freeze your nuts off.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t want to have to come in after you. The
BOY lets the blanket fall and strips out of his parka and clothes. He
runs along the beach naked, skinny and white, leaping SCREAMING into the
icy surf. The MAN watches until the BOY comes out of the water, gasping
with cold, shuddering. He wraps the BOY in the blanket and dries him
off.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: How many people do you think are still
alive?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: In the world? I don’t know. Not very many.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: There could be people alive someplace else.
Besides on earth?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I don’t think so. They couldn’t live any place
else.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Not even if they could get there? If they had
a-a-a spaceship?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: No. It’s unlikely. The BOY stares, shivering,
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Are you all right? What is it? He cups his
hand to the babbling BOY’s forehead.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t feel so good. The BOY bends away and
vomits and the MAN helps, rubbing his back and wiping the BOY’s mouth
when he’s done.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: That’s okay, you didn’t do anything wrong. The
MAN is very worried now.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s okay. You’re going to be okay. It’ll
pass.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Don’t leave me here, don’t go away Papa. Not
even for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I won’t go away. I’m right here. He sits
holding the BOY tightly. He feels for the BOY’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He drops droplets of sugar water from a
bowl into the BOY’s mouth. As the BOY shuts his eyes and dozes he checks
the pulse at his neck and wipes his mouth with the blanket.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Oh no. No no. Not this. Jesus Christ what have
you done to us? What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Hi Papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m right here.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I know. The BOY shuts his eyes and goes back
to sleep. The MAN strokes the BOY’s hair tenderly, takes the pistol from
his belt and carefully hides the pistol under the blanket by the boy’s
side. He stands, takes one last look and walks away…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He looks back along the beach to the
distant figure of the BOY, sitting up wrapped in his blankets, looking
around, confused and scared, enough to make the MAN wince. He collects
himself and wades cautiously into the gray soupy water. He takes a
breath and starts swimming to the boat.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: POV MAN - he catches up with the BOY,
grabs his shoulder with one hand and the gun with the other. REVERSE
ANGLE - the BOY sees it’s the MAN and stops, stares, still frightened,
feverish, wild-eyed, confused.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s okay -</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: A man! There was a man! I saw a man.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s okay, he’s gone now, it’s just me. The
BOY collapses, exhausted, into the MAN’s arms.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Oh Christ. You stupid ass! You stupid ass!</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He stole our shoes. He stole everything. The
BOY goes quiet, forlorn, staring around at the desolation in
despair.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know what we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know why we’re doing this.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Look, there are… There are people… there are
other people and we’ll find them. You’ll see. The BOY just shuts his
eyes and slumps onto the sand in despair. The MAN eyes him
anxiously.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Please. Listen to me. Don’t lose heart. The
MAN seizes the FLARE GUN, takes it from its case hurriedly, loads it
with shells - the BOY now watches, wide- eyed. The MAN rushes a few
paces up the DUNE and looks over to where the trolley was hidden - he
fires a FLARE into the air. The FLARE arcs up into the murk with a long
WHOOSH and breaks in a cloud of light, hanging there, hot tendrils of
magnesium drifting down to the sand. The BOY watches, curious despite
his despair. The MAN strains his eyes to see: the dunes bathed in pink
light from the flare and the sand pock-marked with the footprints of the
STRANGE MAN in a trail leading to the spot where the trolley. The
trolley marks trail off into the distance.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come on. We have to get our shoes back.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We don’t need them!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We won’t get far without them.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They set off hurriedly, in their bare
feet.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come on. They take off after the thief, bare
feet thudding on the tarmac, the MAN in front, the BOY trailing, trying
to catch up. The THIEF looks back at them and speeds up, head bent down
over the handle running for his life. When he looks back again the MAN
has drawn his pistol and is aiming it directly at him. The THIEF stops
the trolley, pulls a carving knife from his belt, and turns to face
them, standing behind the trolley. His face is emaciated and twitchy, a
mouth like a bombed grave yard - not the FACE of the man watching them
in the sand dunes. The MAN trains his gun on him, stock still, holding
the BOY’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Get away from the cart and put the knife down.
The MAN spits and brandishes the knife desperately, he’s scrawny,
sullen, bearded and filthy.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: If you don’t put down the carving knife and
get away from the godamn cart I’m going to blow your brains out.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Be quiet. The MAN cocks the pistol and there’s
two loud CLICKS.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: God damn you.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa please don’t kill the man.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: Come on man, I done what you said, listen to
the boy. The BOY starts crying - the THIEF looks at the BOY and then the
angry MAN, this seems to be sobering. He puts the knife in the trolley
and steps away, hands in the air, his thumbs are missing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: How long have you been following us?</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: I wasn’t following you. I saw the cart on
the sand an’ I just took it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Please Papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Take your clothes off. Take them off, every
godamn stitch.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: Come on man, don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’ll kill you where you stand.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: Don’t do this, man.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I won’t tell you again.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: All right, all right, just take it easy. The
THIEF looks at the BOY who is now covering his ears and the MAN takes an
intimidating step closer with the gun. The THIEF starts stripping and
piling his rags in the road.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: The shoes.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: Come on man.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: The shoes. He sits naked in the road and
unlaces the rotting shoes.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Put them in the cart. The THIEF stands and
drops the shoes in the trolley.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Put the clothes in. The MAN drops the clothes
in and stands there covering himself, shivering.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: Don’t do me like this, man. You don’t need
to do me like this.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You didn’t mind doing it to us.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: Come on, listen to the kid.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You tried to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: I’m starving man. You’d have done the
same.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You took everything.</p>
<p><strong>thief.</strong>: I’ll die out here.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m going to leave you the way you left
us.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN grabs the trolley by the handle,
pulls it around, puts the pistol on top and holds his hand out for the
BOY.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Let’s go. The BOY doesn’t take his hand but
they set off along the blacktop, the BOY snivelling and crying, leaving
the THIEF shivering and whimpering.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Oh papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I can’t stop it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What do you think would have happened to him
if we hadn’t caught him? You’ve got to learn.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t want to learn!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I won’t be here forever. Sooner or later
you’ll have to look after yourself. The BOY just looks at him - and
keeps crying.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You have to stop crying.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I can’t. The BOY looks back one last time as
the THIEF disappears from view - still just standing there, utterly
lost. The MAN stops and puts his shoes on. He walks back up the road to
the bend but the THIEF has gone.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He’s gone. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: He’s not gone. He’s not. The MAN looks
helplessly at the tearful BOY as he fits his shoes on for him, the tears
streaking the soot on his face.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Just help him, Papa. Just help him. The MAN
looks back down the road, weighing it up.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: He was just hungry Papa. He’s going to
die.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: He’s going to die anyway.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: He’s so scared.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I’m scared. Do you understand? I’m scared. The
MAN tries to look the BOY in the eye but he keeps his head bowed,
sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You’re not the one who has to worry about
everything. The BOY mumbles, tearful and snotty.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What? What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes I am. I am the one. The MAN stops and
faces-the innocent BOY angrily, stares, then relenting, summons all his
strength, turns the trolley around and they start wheeling it back the
way they came.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: All right. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN takes the BOY’s hand and puts it
on the trolley handle.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: He’s afraid to answer.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Is this where we stopped?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know. I think so. They keep walking,
hands cupped to mouths, hallooing mindlessly. The MAN stops to rest and
watches the BOY a moment, he has stopped crying as he calls out for the
thief. Finally the MAN piles the THIEF’s shoes and clothes in the road.
He puts a rock on top of them.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Come on. We have to go. The BOY eyes the
clothes sadly, silent now.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I have to get your temperature down. The BOY
swallows the pills and the water, shivering.</p>
<p><strong>boy-.</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Of course you can.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What would you do if I died?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: If you died I’d want to die too.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: So you could be with me?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: So I could be with you, yes. But that’s not
going to happen. They look at each other a moment, unsure, the BOY
shivering and sick-looking. The BOY lies down and shuts his eyes. The
MAN puts a blanket over him. The MAN walks away a few paces and coughs
endlessly, a nagging cough that won’t go.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Papa? The MAN rouses himself, sits up and just
stares at the BOY, amazed, as if he has arisen from the grave</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I feel kind of weird.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Just thirsty. The MAN gets up and fetches
water from a ferry can in the trolley, pours a cup, hands it to the BOY
who drinks thirstily. The MAN reaches out and strokes the BOY’s hair as
he drinks.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can I tell you something?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You tell me I shouldn’t cry but I’ve heard you
crying. I hear you coughing and crying to yourself in the night when you
think I’m asleep.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: What of it?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: So if I shouldn’t cry you shouldn’t cry
either.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s a Beetle. Suddenly the beetle twitches,
then activates its wings and flies out of the box with a BUZZ and
upwards into the sky… The BOY and the MAN stare up at the flying
creature, amazed</p>
<p><strong>and:</strong>: Without warning something WHISTLES over their
heads very close and hits the wall beside them with a loud CLATTER. The
MAN lunges at the BOY, landing on top of him to cover him and tries to
grab the trolley which tips over, spilling everything out. The MAN
desperately tries to take cover while he looks over his shoulder and
sees: POV MAN - in the upper window of a warehouse a man is drawing a
bow and arrow aimed right at them. In desperation the MAN covers the BOY
and tries to scrabble away but there’s a DULL TWANG of bowstring and an
arrow THUDS into his leg.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Oh you bastard! You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN claws the blankets from the
upturned trolley aside and scrabbles around for the pistol but it has
fallen from his belt onto the cobbles and scattered out of reach. He
spots the flare gun and seizes it, resting it on the trolley and aiming
carefully at the empty window. When the lone ARCHER appears again he
squeezes off a shot and the flare goes rocketing up towards the window
in a firey arc, ablaze with color, clean through the window. They can
hear the ARCHER SCREAMING inside and see the colored light still flaring
from the window.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Oh Papa!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Stay just like you are. He gets up and runs
limping across the street, the arrow still embedded in his leg.</p>
<p><strong>archer’s woman.</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Who else is up here?</p>
<p><strong>archer’s woman.</strong>: You fucking asshole! The MAN looks
down, his leg is bleeding heavily now and the arrow is still sticking
out.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Where’s the bow?</p>
<p><strong>archer’s woman.</strong>: I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Why are you following us?</p>
<p><strong>archer’s woman.</strong>: We’re not following anybody. You
were following us! The MAN stares at the WOMAN, looking her up and down,
she looks sick and thin and desperate. He looks at the ARCHER, lying
there dead, his chest and one arm and his face burnt, still smoking. The
WOMAN covers his face with the blanket and the MAN doesn’t know what to
say, ashamed. He goes.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: See if you can find the medical kit from the
boat. Quickly. The BOY rummages in the trolley, finds the kit and hands
it over. He stares as the MAN slowly extracts the spoon, wincing in
agony. The MAN dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit and searches
through the kit for a needle. He finds a suture needle in a sterile
envelope, rips it open with his teeth and, using the light coming in
through the parlour windows he threads some silk thread into the needle.
He starts to suture up the wound, grimacing in pain as the BOY watches
in silence, until eventually offering:</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Does it hurt? The MAN just looks at him in
disbelief - beat.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes! It hurts!</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What does it feel like? The MAN eyes the BOY,
amazed at this inopportune chat.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: At least you’re talking to me now.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Do you want me to tell you a story?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Your stories aren’t true.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: They don’t have to be true. They’re
stories.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: In the stories we’re always helping people.
But we don’t help people. We just shoot people. And in the stories good
things happen but we just get sick. The MAN thinks about it - stuck for
an answer.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We’re still here aren’t we? Doesn’t that mean
anything?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We have to leave the cart. I can’t push it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What are we going to do Papa? The MAN can’t
answer for breathlessness.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Well, what are we? The MAN sits heavily on the
ground, totters as the BOY stands watching him, eyes welling with
tears.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Oh no, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Don’t get comfortable. You need to keep going.
You don’t know what might be down the road.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: We were always lucky. You’ll be lucky again.
You’ll see. Just go.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s all right. This has been a long time
coming. Just keep going south. Do everything the way we did it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: No. You’re going to be okay Papa. You have
to.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Keep the gun with you at all times. Don’t let
anyone take it from you. You need to find the good guys but you can’t
take any chances. Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I want to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I want to be with you too but I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You have to go off on your own now. You have
to carry the fire.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know how to.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes you do. You know everything about it.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Is it real? The fire? Papa?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Where is it? I don’t know where it is.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Yes you do.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: It’s inside you. It was always there. I can
see it. The BOY stares at him, not sure what to believe.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You have to let me go.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Just take me with you please. Please, Papa!
What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Just hold my hand. The BOY grips the MAN’s
hand, bouncing up and down, agitated.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You said you wouldn’t ever leave me.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: I know. I’m sorry. The BOY falls on the MAN,
hugging him tight, face pressed to his chest, sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: My boy. You have my whole heart. You always
did. You’re the best guy. You can talk to me and I’ll talk to you.
You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: How will I hear you?</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: You just will.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>man-.</strong>: You just have to practice. Just don’t give up
okay? You’ll be okay. You’re going to be lucky. I know you are.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The MAN closes his eyes and takes deep,
rattling breaths.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: It’s okay Papa. You don’t have to talk
anymore. Camera pulls back and the BOY is sitting with the MAN saying
nothing. It’s starting to grow dark. The BOY crouches down on the MAN’s
chest and goes to sleep there, rising and falling with his father’s
breathing.</p>
<p><strong>woman.</strong>: Hello… She kisses him and they look at the
blue ocean and the white sand and green sea grass and she puts an arm
around him.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: If I were God I would have made the world just
so and no different… And so I have you. .I have you.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Oh Papa. Papa. Papa…</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can I tell you something? I had a bad dream. I
had this penguin that you wound up and it would waddle and flap its
flippers. And we were in that house we used to live in and it came
around the corner but nobody had wound it up and it was really scary
because-because- because… He goes quiet as he finishes tending to the
body and puts his own parka on, zips it up.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: The winder wasn’t turning. He takes the gun,
checks the magazine, shuts it and stands, shoving the pistol in his
belt.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Where’s the man you were with? Was he your
father?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes. He was my Papa.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Well, I think maybe you should come with
me. The BOY’s finger tightens on the trigger of the GUN.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Are you one of the good guys?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Yeah. I’m one of the good guys. Why don’t
you put that pistol away?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’m not supposed to let anybody take the
pistol. No matter what.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: I don’t want your pistol. I just didn’t
want you pointing it at me. The BOY lowers the gun to his side and the
VETERAN comes a few steps closer, causing the BOY to back up a step.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Where’s your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t have much stuff.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: What have you got? Blankets?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: My Papa’s wrapped in them.</p>
<p><strong>man.</strong>: Show me. The BOY doesn’t move. The MAN holds
out his hand for the BOY to take, the BOY sees he has a THUMB MISSING
and hesitates, wary. The MAN squats, leaning on his shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Look. You got two choices here. You can
stay here with your papa or you can go with me. If you stay you need to
keep off the road.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: How do I know you’re one of the good guys?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: You don’t. You’ll have to take a shot. The
BOY weighs it up, eyeing the VETERAN.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you have any kids?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Yes we do.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Do you have a little boy?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: We have a little boy and a little
girl.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: How old is he?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: He’s about your age. Maybe a little
older.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: And you didn’t eat them?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: You don’t eat people?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: No. We don’t eat people.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Are you carrying the fire?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Am I what?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Carrying the fire.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: You’re kind of weirded out, aren’t you,
kid?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Well, are you?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Yeah. I am. I’m carrying the fire.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: And I can go with you?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Yes, you can. The BOY hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Are these all the blankets you have?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Is that your suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes. The VETERAN stands and studies the
BOY.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Why don’t you go up onto the road and wait
for me. I’ll bring the blankets.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What about my Papa?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: We can’t just leave him here.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Yes we can.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I don’t want people to see him.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: There’s nobody to see him.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Can I cover him in leaves?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: The wind will blow them away.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Could we cover him with one of the
blankets?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Okay. I’ll do it. Go on now.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Here. Wrap this around you. You’re cold.
The BOY eye the blanket uncertainly, holds out the pistol for the
VETERAN to hold.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: You hold onto that.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Do you know how to shoot it?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: What about my papa?</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: There’s nothing else to be done.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I think I want to say goodbye to him.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Will you be all right?</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: Go ahead. I’ll wait here for you. The BOY
turns around and heads down to the beach.</p>
<p><strong>boy.</strong>: I’ll talk to you every day. And I won’t
forget. No matter what. No matter what, Papa. The BOY dries his eyes,
takes a breath, gets up and walks back to the road…</p>
<p><strong>motherly woman.</strong>: Oh. I am so glad to see you. The
BOY just stares at her, bemused - a short distance away stands the rest
of the family - a BOY his age and a GIRL. The BOY stares at the OTHER
BOY and recognizes him - it’s the same BOY he chased earlier.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Then the BOY notices a threadbare
mongrel of a DOG, waiting with them. The MOTHERLY WOMAN goes over and
puts her arms around him.</p>
<p><strong>motherly woman.</strong>: We’ve been following you. Did you
know that? We saw you with your Papa and we tried to catch up but you
were too quick for us.</p>
<p><strong>veteran.</strong>: There was some discussion about whether to
even come after you at all.</p>
<p><strong>motherly woman.</strong>: We’re so lucky. We were so worried
about you. And now we don’t have to worry about a thing. She kisses the
BOY on the forehead and holds him at arm’s length and looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>motherly woman.</strong>: How does that sound? Is that okay?
He stares but says nothing…</p>
