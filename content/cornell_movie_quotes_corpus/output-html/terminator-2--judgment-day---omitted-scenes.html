<p><strong>extended future war</strong>: SARAH’S E.C.T. MISSILE DREAM
SALCEDA’S DEATH GANT RANCH DYSON’S VISION</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It all came down on a Tuesday in September of
’99. Pretty normal day, except for the end of the world part. Somehow, I
don’t remember how, we started calling it Judgment Day. I was in
Argentina that particular Tuesday. A good place to be, considering
everything alive north of the equator stopped being alive…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Afterward it got cold. Real cold. Nuclear
winter they called it. The few that survived, starved…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The few that survived that saw the Machines
rise up… machines of many types but with one purpose… to hunt us down
and kill us all like a bunch of cockroaches…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Our stubbornness makes no sense to their
machine minds. We fight when logic tells us we are beaten. But we have a
saying… it’s not over ’till its over. It keeps us going. The war against
the Machines is in its thirty-first year…</p>
<p><strong>headset voice</strong>: … The Colorado Division confirms that
Skynet has been destroyed… The war is over… I repeat, Skynet has been
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: My name is Connor. It’s my job to lead these
people. My mother, Sarah, gave me the job… and she’s not exactly someone
you say “no” to. I wish to God I had. I’ve sent thousands to their
deaths. But let me tell you about death in this world. We piss on the
bones of a billion people. Death’s not what it used to be. If there is a
God, his love and 45 cents will buy you coffee…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: All these machines were controlled by a kind
of God, a low-rent self- appointed God called Skynet. Skynet was a
supercomputer built for strategic defense back in the Nineties. Today we
destroyed it in its fortress in the Colorado Rockies, and all its toys
stopped…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This place is one of Skynet’s toys. A
machine built by machines.It is like nothing which has ever existed
before… the first tactical time weapon. Before today, no human had seen
this place, but I’ve been here in my dreams many times. All my life I’ve
tried to imagine what it would look like. Now I’m actually here…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Skynet, being almost infinitely smart, was
also infinitely tricky. It knew it was losing, so it thought of a way to
rig the game…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: And now, though we’ve won the war, there is
still one battle left to fight. The most important one. It will be
fought in the past, almost four decades ago… before all this began… See,
the only problem with time travel is… it ain’t over even when it’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Did you know I’d be the one who
volunteered?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’ve always known. Sarah told me.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: That’s why you moved me to your unit? Kept me
so close.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: We’re ready, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Sometimes you have to put your faith in the
machine.</p>
<p><strong>fuentes</strong>: Now what happens to Reese? I mean, what did
happen?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: He accomplishes his mission and in doing so,
he dies.</p>
<p><strong>fuentes</strong>: He is a good soldier.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yes… He’s also my father.</p>
<p><strong>fuentes</strong>: Mother of God!</p>
<p><strong>fuentes</strong>: Sapper team. Set your charges. Let’s blow
this place back to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Not yet. There’s one more thing we have to
do.</p>
<p><strong>fuentes</strong>: John?… John?…</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: What’s fascinating about her case is that
the architecture of the delusion–</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t talk about me like I’m not here. I’m
right goddamn here!</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: We know where you are, Sarah… … the
delusion seems to have begun with the boyfriend and then been adopted by
the patient. He believed he was a soldier from the next century, sent to
protect her from a killer machine called a “terminator”.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: You see, it’s all about machines, for
her. We’re seeing more and more of this new syndrome, a sort of acute
phobic reaction to technology. It’s a defensive response to the
dehumanization of relationships in a high-tech world.</p>
<p><strong>electro-convulsive therapy</strong>: Yes, they still do this
shit to people.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Sarah, today we’re going to be trying
ECT… electro-convulsive therapy–</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No! Don’t do this. Okay, look, Silberman –
hey! Don’t put that – HEY!</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Now relax, we’ve found this very helpful
with problems like yours. Such as this feeling that you’re being
persecuted–</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not being persecuted, you fucking moron!
I’m not a threat to them anymore. I told you. It’s my son who’s the
target!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’ve got to let me go so I can protect him!
He’s naked if they come for him now! Please! Why won’t you listen? You
know how important this is!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Goddamnit. Let me go!! I’ll kill you,
FUCKER!!</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: ECT is coming back into favor lately, and
we’ve had good results with it. It looks worse than it is. As soon as
the current hits her brain, she’s out. It’s a bit like punching the
restart button on a computer when the program crashes.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: She’s not feeling anything right now.</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Where is John Connor?</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: John who?</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: I know this hurts. Where is John Connor?</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: FUCK YOU!!</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Do you know where John Connor is?</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: When they reached the main road, did they go
north… … or south?</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t get out. They saw us coming three miles
back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Tell Gant I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: He doesn’t want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Just tell him, pendejo. And tell him I have
John with me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This place is run by a guy named Travis Gant.
An ex-Green Beret. A total wild man… he’s got connections all over
Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Put the shotgun back in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: You ride with me. Enrique will bring your
truck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What makes you think he’ll help us?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’ll help us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The last time Gant and Sarah were in the same
room he was in a drunken rage and coming after her with a sheepskinning
knife.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We were breaking up at the time.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Man, you are one fuckin’ section- eight crazy
fucking bitch, coming here, you know that? Hi John, long time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Your picture’s all over the TV, you know that?
You and your psycho buddy, there. Man I do NOT need this! I got a
business to run. I can’t afford any heat up here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So deal to us and we’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Guns… heavy stuff. Explosives… and com gear,
travel documents. And I need you to get us across the ditch and arrange
a trip south. Costa Rica. Peru. Whatever you can set up.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: How about the fillings out of my fucking
teeth?! Man, you are unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is going better than I thought it
would.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: I can’t believe you had the balls to come back
here. And dragging that poor kid along. You still feeding him all that
crazy shit about a nuclear war and how he’s gonna be the savior of all
mankind?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Still a goddamn loony tune. You always were. A
good fuck, but a loony tune. Just get out of here, Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I need your help, Gant.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Forget it. When the Ice Capades open in Hell,
you call me.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Get her out of here!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Tell him what you are.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Series 800 terminator. Model 101. Cyborg
tactical infiltrator.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Oh my God. A killing machine from the future.
Watch out, guys.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Man, you two deserve each other.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Give me your .45. I need to show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Can I shoot you in the head with this?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: If it will help.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Bullshit!!</p>
<p><strong>pow! pow!</strong>: Terminator’s head jerks a little with
each hit. John winces. The cyborg turns to them, calm and unhurt.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No problemo.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Come inside.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Yolanda?! We got company!</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Where’s the fucking tequila?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: That’s Yolanda. Mrs. Gant. Go figure, huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi. Nice to meet you. I’m John, this is Sarah,
and this is– Uh… my uncle. Bob. Uncle Bob.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: And this is Paco. Honey, take Pacolito.
Thanks, baby.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: So… everything you always said. The war… the
future… it’s all real?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Wheww! Damn. I feel like I been kneed in the
balls here. This is big. Drink?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I tried to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: I know. You did. Many times.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Any place I shouldn’t go?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Su casa, John. You know that. Anything I got’s
yours.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Uncle Bob?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: When you first laid that shit on me, about
John, I thought you were section-eight for sure. Psycho waitress that
thinks her kid’s fucking Napoleon.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You didn’t exactly throw us out.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Naw. I start cuttin’ people off just cause
they’re crazy an’ I’d lose all my friends. Now I see why you were always
serious as a heart attack. Carrying that kind of shit around, by
yourself, year after year. I’m impressed kid.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: How long did you live here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Four years. But we spent a lot of time in
Nicaragua, Costa Rica… places like that. Wherever Travis had business. I
thought this was how people lived. Like everybody grew up doing weapons
training. Riding around in helicopters. Learning how to blow shit
up.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Gant taught you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My mom and him, yeah. When she got busted I
got put in a regular school. The other kids thought I was a little
weird.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Yeah… now I look back I can see your whole
plan. Find some guy that knows weapons and tactics, some dumb bastard,
and get him to teach you how to run a military operation… so you could
pass it on when the kid was old enough. Brilliant. And I was the dumb
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Travis…</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Everything had a purpose. Coming on to me,
getting me to teach you, take you out on runs. Christ, I didn’t care.
Long’s you wrapped them legs around me, I’d a done anything. Damn, you
didn’t give one shit for me really, did you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry, Travis.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: You took me for a ride, got what you needed,
and got off.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I did what I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Yeah. I guess you did. You wanna know what’s
crazy about it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: You did it exactly right. You knew what you
had to do and you did it. You got nerves of fucking stainless steel,
baby. I’m proud of ya. I really mean that.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: To the future! Fuck it if it can’t take a
joke! Right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s sad, me mom and Travis. She won’t let
anybody take the place of my real dad.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Kyle Reese.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. He’s dead. Hey! Did you ever meet him?
Up in the future, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wish I coulda met him. I guess I will, when
I’m older, cause I send him back through time and all. He hasn’t even
been born yet. Man, it messes with your head.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: It messes with your head.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. My mom and him were only together for
one night, but she talks about him every day. She still loves him, I
guess. I see her crying sometimes. She denies it totally, of course.
Says she got something in her eye.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Why do you cry?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Left 3 to 48. You mean people? I don’t know.
We just cry. You know. When it hurts. Right 2 to 90.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Pain causes it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh-unh, no, pain is like a… like an alarm that
tells you when there’s damage. This is different… And left one to 20.
It’s when there’s nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. Because
you love somebody, and they’re gone or whatever. You get it?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He should change this combination.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Radical.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. I thought you’d like this place.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, do you feel any different yet? Like
you’re learning stuff?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I don’t know. I feel the same.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you figured out yet why you can’t go
around killing people?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Because it hurts them?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nooo. Because it hurts the people who love
them. Get it? That’s the value of human life… we have feelings, people
love each other. Are you afraid of dying?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: See, that’s the problem. You don’t care if you
live or die, and so you think everybody’s like that.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I have to stay functional until my
mission is complete. Then it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. I have to stay functional too. “I’m too
important”. She won’t even let me play football. It’s a drag.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: It’s set. Soon as it’s dark we’ll cross the
ditch in the Huey, and I’ve got a Citation meeting us at that strip in
San Lupe.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … if we’re ever separated, go directly to
Gant’s ranch. Travis will take care of you until I get there…</p>
<p><strong>chp</strong>: Freeze! Police!</p>
<p><strong>closeup.</strong>: He’s wearing a headset/microphone under
his helmet. We hear him calling in the report.</p>
<p><strong>2nd chp</strong>: Roger, that’s a positive I.D. on the
vehicle. Suspect is in custody.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: So you’re supposed to stay with the kid
forever, and teach him, protect him, and keep him out of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Buddy, sounds like you just got yourself
elected father.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Women’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I’m not even human.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: No, it’s fucking brilliant. Think about it.
She knows you’ll never stop… that you’ll always be there. And you’ll
never hurt the kid. You’ll never shout at him, never get drunk and hit
him. Never say you can’t spend time with him ’cause you’re too busy. And
you’d die to protect him. You’re the ultimate parent.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: You’re better suited. The boy likes
you.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Naw. I ain’t the guy. Forget it. She wrote me
off a long time ago. Too many bad habits.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Anyway, considering what’s ahead for that kid,
you’re a better role model… God help him.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: You are a father. Do you have any
advice?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Talk about the blind leading the blind. My
advice? Lighten up – the kid’s world is so goddamn grim – smile once in
a while.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Smile?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Yeah. Smile. You know. Hey, Enrique… your
sister still sucking off donkeys in Tijuana?</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: No man, she’s cutting down. Your mother’s
taking all the business.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: See. That’s a smile.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: I don’t know, maybe you could practice in
front of a mirror or something.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fly John out tonight as planned. Then come
back and wait for me here. I’ll be back by dawn.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Where you going? Hey!! Where –
god-DAMN-it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: “No fate but what we make.” My father told her
this… I mean, I made him memorize it, up in the future as a message to
her– Never mind. Okay, the whole thing goes “The Future is not set.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.”</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: What’s it mean?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: It means she intends to change the
future somehow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dyson!!!</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Miles Dyson. She’s gonna blow him away. Son of
a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Who’s Dyson?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We gotta stop her. Travis, you stay here in
case she comes back. Keep her here till we get back. We need a jeep.</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Take that one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on. Let’s get our stuff.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Why do you want to stop her, John? It
may work.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t care!! Haven’t you learned anything?!
There’s gotta be another way. Think!</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Main gate? Miguel? Don’t talk, just key your
walkie if you copy, over. Salceda? You copy? Franco? Come back.</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Where is John Connor?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: John who?</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Where is John Connor?</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: Don’t know… gone. Aaaarrgh!</p>
<p><strong>gant</strong>: FUCK YOU!!</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Where is John Connor?</p>
<p><strong>ingram</strong>: I don’t know, man… aaaargh… they were
talking about some guy… Dyson or something like that…</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
