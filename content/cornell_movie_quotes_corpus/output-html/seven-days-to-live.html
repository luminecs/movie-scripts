<p><strong>you have</strong>: 7 DAYS TO LIVE</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: How long has the house already been like
this?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: No idea. I haven’t seen them in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: I haven’t seen them in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: We’re going in.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Pooh, what a stench…</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: My God… Marlene…!</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Frank… Hell, what happened in here?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Now that’s really odd.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: I’d say she drowned…</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Frank…!?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sir, we have arrived at your residence.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you, James.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, look here!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen: The “Straub
country-residence”.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It looks more like the “Straub ruins”.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Welcome to the far end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The lap of nature. Where’s your famous
optimism?</p>
<p><strong>removal man</strong>: Lunch break is ’til one o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sure, take your time. They get a lunch break
before they even start working. Cool job.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The country residence offers everything the
doctor ordered for a stressed author needs: fresh air, clean water and -
most of all - absolute peace and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This wood is pretty decayed. Hope I don’t land
a floor lower.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Although it would give you a perfect
opportunity to visit our new wine cellar.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How old is this shack, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Four hundred years. Come on, I’ll give you a
tour of the museum… …while our husbands already get to work.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want
to have it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tenth floor.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Look at this. The lock is totally
demolished.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guess someone lost their key. You did get
your tetanus shots, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I mean, seriously: It is strange, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So what if it is. There hasn’t been anyone in
this house for at least ten years.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Twenty-three, to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I wonder how you guys figure on renovating
this whole place. You can afford to spend some money. If I was you, I’d
spare myself all the hard work. Besides, didn’t you want to start
writing again?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah sure, I will. Give me a little more
time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If you throw away your career, that won’t
change anything either. Now don’t get me wrong, but I’m telling you this
as your friend: Your last books were awful. The publishing house isn’t
even sure whether to extend your contract.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t care about my career right now,
Paul. Ellen and I need to get our minds on other things, first. After
everything we’ve been through.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Here, partner: A breakfast for
champions.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I can’t right now! I’m about to break the
high-score!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You do that. But first, eat your breakfast,
Tommi.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Goes to show again who’s in command around
here.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sometimes I get the feeling you only love me
for my body.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why else?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Come on, say it. You know…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh no, not again. I just said it for you
last week.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Say it anyway. Come on, how much do you love
me?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: “With you, my life began and with you shall
it end…”</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tommi, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: This is serious! Quick, call emergency!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: This is Straub. You have to come, fast! My
son, he swallowed something… Quick, he’s choking to death…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I have to cut his windpipe…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re not a doctor, you’ll hurt him!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What else should I do, damn it, he’s
dying!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Too high, you’re way too far up… you have to
cut here…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ellen, move aside…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh God, Tommi…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s the matter? Come on, cut…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Ellen!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Ellen, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m fine. I was just distracted for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: To our hard-working wives.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Don’t rejoice too soon. The bill is already
on it’s way.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I still can’t picture it: The two of you as
country folk. I’m telling you, in six weeks you’ll be back in the
city.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hold it right there! I hate to play the big
boss, but as Martin’s publisher I can only say: Make the best of the
peace and quiet, the fresh air and all that - and write a new
masterpiece!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: First things first. Now it’s our turn - just
the two of us.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: “Wake up, wake up, it’s break of day.” Paul
and Claudia have already left, you sleepyhead.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You’re right. Forget about getting up. We’ll
have breakfast in bed.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: How romantic!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You’ll never get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: So, how does it feel to be kissed by two
women?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: They say it’s fantastic. At least that’s
what I read in a men’s magazine. So who are the two lucky ones?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Me and the muse, of course. How is your book
coming along?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, the muse… we’re still having our
differences. You know how it is with women.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Well then, I guess I’d better leave the two
of you alone. But don’t forget…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: … we wanted to take some time out for
ourselves. I know. And I’ll only work a little while, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, nothing. Where did this picture come
from?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I found it here. It’s kind of creepy, don’t
you think?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah. It is, kind of.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What kind of a horrible thing is that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It still worked in town.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I mean the armchair!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, that was upstairs. A real antiquity! I
think it’s great.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Maybe the antenna’s broken.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We’re probably lucky that we even have
running water and electricity! Damned box!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hey… the fuse.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, damnit!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Do you know where fuse box is?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: In the cellar, I think. Wait, I’ll take care
of it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: God, look at that…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I wanted to know what’s taking you so long.
You’ve been down here forever. It sure is cold down here. We certainly
won’t be needing a freezer.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: We’ll sure be sorting a bunch of this stuff
out.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Look at this! We’ll have to fix the whole
wiring. This stuff is dangerous as hell.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: We’ll call for someone from town first thing
in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Are you crazy? That costs a fortune!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Do you have a better idea?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: My father was an electrician. Already forgot
that?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My father was a pilot. And do I know how to
fly?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Just do me a favor and don’t get yourself
roasted!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hey, flower child, the sixties are over. And
this stuff is hazardous to your health.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yes, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Well, if you won’t let me smoke grass, then
at least I’ll go get myself some cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That stuff is gonna end up killing you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Making our very own solstice fire.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Is everything alright? Aren’t you feeling
well?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I just had a really strange experience.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: On an ordinary traffic sign, I read…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, nothing. I guess I just still haven’t
recovered as well as I try to make everyone believe.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hey, take your time. You know time heals
better than any shrink ever can.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I have a funny feeling. Do you think we’ll
get over all that’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We just have to make a new beginning.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Cherry-red Tears.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it
at least nine times. And then I found out you were going to attend some
kind of book fair.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not a book fair. I was signing autographs in
a department store.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I was so excited about meeting you. Again and
again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to
talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And two months later, we got married. And
all because of one sentence: “With you, my life began and with you shall
it end…”</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Don’t say that. Please.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I miss Tommi so much.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So do I, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Do you really think anything can ever be like
it was before?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Maybe different. I don’t know, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: If we stand a chance at all, it’s only by
sticking together.</p>
<p><strong>radiobroadcaster</strong>: “… a very special day today.
Exceptionally hot, even for this time of year. And all the windows in my
studio are already wide open…”</p>
<p><strong>radiobroadcaster</strong>: By the way, Ellen: You have five
days left to live.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>radiobroadcaster</strong>: “… and matching today’s weather
it’s time for some more of the hottest music of the North…”</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hello. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Does this dog here belong to you?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: No, I’ve never seen him before.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: You know, I saw him sitting outside your
gate… Oh, I’m sorry, I’m forgetting my manners again! I haven’t even
introduced myself yet. Hi, my name’s Lindner. Karl Lindner.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Ellen Straub.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: It’s a pleasure. You’re from the city,
right?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Do I look like it that much?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Village gossip. You’re a real attraction
here.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re from around here, aren’t you? There’s
something I’ve been wondering about the whole time: This house, why has
it been empty all these years? I mean, I doubt if it was the price.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: I guess it’s too lonely for most folks.
It’s time for me to get going. It’s been a pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Wait, won’t you join me for a cup of
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: No, thank you. I need to get back home. My
wife is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Someone from the village.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, there’s something I… uh… need to tell
you about.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay, now let me see if I’ve got this
straight. First you get warnings from a road sign and then from the
weather forecast. Which one of us two was the author again?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, it’s not funny!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You know, it’s not always easy for me,
either. But at least I try not to give in to each and every
neurosis.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try
talking to you. Don’t you remember what we promised to each other?
Honesty - trust!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Come on, this isn’t about honesty. You just
need a good night’s sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I
hardly get any sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Well, excuse me for having bothered you with
my problems.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Now, what did I do to deserve this?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Come on, at least try one. It took me two
hours to make these.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What I really meant to say was: I’m sorry.
I’m a real bonehead sometimes. But it’s just that I’m worried about you.
I’m afraid you might get carried away with something like that.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tastes awful.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But baked with lots of love.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I think I’d better get rid of this. After
all, I don’t want to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: …Maybe you’re right and I just need to get
some sleep. Don’t worry. I’ll get settled in sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tommi…?</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin… did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tommi?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tommi!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tommi, wait!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So, did you sleep good?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah… I have to go to town.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Is there anything you need?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hey, you’re still here. I suppose you like it
here with us.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, thanks. I have everything I need. Drive
safely, you hear?</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: You see, there are various approaches to
an explanation for what you are currently going through.</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: One of the latest theories claim that at
certain frequencies, air conditioners create an oscillation that can, in
fact, cause hallucinations. They may also be due to the interior
pressure of your eyes and so on and so forth. Personally I believe that
all of this is nonsense. The loss of a child is a traumatic experience.
Subconsciously, you may still be blaming yourself for it, and maybe now
believe that your son should punish you…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Listen, it’s one thing to have a guilt
complex. But I know the difference between when I’m overstrung and when
I’m seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began
after we moved!</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: There is, of course, another possible
explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: And that is?</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: A tumor - which could cause pressure on
certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: Just to be on the safe side, I would
like to have a few tests done.</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: Congratulations. You are definitely the
healthiest person I’ve had in CT for years.</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: Dr. Roth gave me these for you. Three
times a day, after meals.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: Fluctin. A pretty strong
antidepressive… If you asked me, I’d try to do without them first.</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: You come from Goldmoor?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: We just moved there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: One time, when I was in college, we
examined a swamp corpse in pathology. They had excavated it there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: Three or four thousand years old. But I
didn’t deal with the subject any more than necessary. You know, I never
liked pathology. Somehow, I always felt it reduced humans to something
they are not.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Dr. Schleth.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What do you believe happens to a human after
he dies?</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: You mean, do I believe in something
like a soul?</p>
<p><strong>dr. schleth</strong>: I haven’t seen one on any of my x- ray
pictures, yet. But then again, what would x-rays know?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hey, girl! Here, I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Now all we need is a name for you. How about
Clara - okay, then: Clara.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Hi, love. Trouble with the fuses again?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s a real mess. I think it’d be better for
you not to go down there for a while. It’s just too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t tell me you’ve made friends with that
wandering flea circus?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Why not? She can guard the house. By the way,
I gave her a name: Clara.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Where have you been all day?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I went to see Prof. Roth! You know, I had
another one of those dreams last night. I saw Tommi!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ellen… our Tommi is dead. And there’s
nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You know, Martin, since we moved to this
house… sometimes I just get the feeling that the past is catching up to
us again…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh! Now we’re getting to the point! So all
of a sudden, it’s the house. Yesterday, it was a road sign. And the
first thing you do is go and run to “Dr. Freud”!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: But that’s not the point! What if all these
things are somehow connected?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, baloney. You should just hear yourself
talk!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll be in the study, just in case you
decide to get reasonable, after all.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Either Martin is right or I am really
starting to lose my mind…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: “…certain places arouse recollections and
links within us…”</p>
<p><strong>sales lady</strong>: First buy it, then read it!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yes, of course… I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>sales lady</strong>: You’re the wife of that author, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin Straub, yes.</p>
<p><strong>sales lady</strong>: Used to write some nice books, your
husband. But that last one was awful. A terrible book. Didn’t sell,
either.</p>
<p><strong>sales lady</strong>: I read it - violent trash. My husband
said so, too.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Well, I’ve got to get going… ’bye.</p>
<p><strong>sales lady</strong>: It’s bad and it’s violent. I don’t like
that kind of stuff. Tell that to your husband.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Come on, Clara. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mr. Lindner!</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Straub. May I introduce you to my
wife?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Just call me Elisabeth.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: You’re doing fine, aren’t you? I mean…
the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: In the moor? What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Stop scaring people. Let’s go. We need to
be on our way.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Excuse us. But do stop by for a visit
sometime! You are welcome anytime.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: You didn’t tell her!</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: We should leave the past alone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Well, it will never leave us alone as
long as you ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It seems to be going well for you.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: In the village. Look what I found.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Psychology, huh? So, what side of the
rainbow are we on today?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: “Events commonly interpreted as haunting
apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested
traumatic ordeals…”</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?
That we’ve created ourselves a ghost? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s just a feeling. Don’t you sense it,
too?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What? What am I supposed to sense?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The house - Tommi - something just doesn’t
jive here…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Now you go starting that again. We decided
together, to build up something new here. I, for my part, am working on
it very hard. But oddly, you seem to have changed your mind.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p><strong>paul and claudia</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Well, this really is a surprise! Come on
in!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, my man! How’s the masterpiece coming
along?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not so bad, if I could get some peace and
quiet around here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey, hey, hey! Say no more until you’ve seen
what we brought:</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Scrabble!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: God, you should’ve seen him! Elke Schneider
enters the room and storms up to him. She is tremendous. Her breasts are
so big that just recently, there was a discussion about whether they
should be given country names of their own.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Paul, you and your stories… I’ve really
missed you!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m impressed! You two have really gotten
quite a bit done, already.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What do you think? We worked our fingers to
the bone and now, we’re both about to have a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I really wouldn’t have thought you two
could stand it out here for this long. To tell the truth, we even have
some bets going with a couple of people…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well? Are you going to play?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I pass.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Triple word score, that makes 72 points. Now
what do you say to that, honey-bunny?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: My hero.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Ellen, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I just got exactly the same letters for the
second time.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, “three days”. A new message!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Because - you know - Ellen is receiving
messages from road signs, radio broadcasters and now from Scrabble game
stones.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And the best part is: She thinks the
messages are meant to announce her death. Hooooo…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Talk about spooky. Martin, do you remember
that splintered door to the study? I guess there was more to it than
just a lost key.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Let me see that!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Just perfect, Paul! Well done! Can’t you
tell that my wife is upset enough already? And then you come up with
this kind of a story?!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What do you think you’re doing, anyway? Now
give me back that article!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ellen, I just don’t want you to get upset
for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: How thoughtful of you!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Excuse me for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: She shouldn’t be worrying about this stuff.
Lately, she’s been acting strange enough already.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What’s this going on between you two?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I was hoping things would
get better once we moved.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But nothing got any better?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Lately, Martin hasn’t been his normal self.
The work, the relocation…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You have to give him some time, Ellen. He’s
under enormous pressure right now. He hasn’t written a single decent
sentence since the accident.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yes, I know. I try my best. It’s just that…
sometimes I wonder if we made a mistake by moving here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: So, work is going well, you say?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes. Splendid. I finally found a story
that’s both: thrilling and true to life.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m glad to hear that. You know…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: NOW SHUT UP, YOU STUPID BITCH !</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know, I think I have to get up early in
the morning. We ought to get going.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hi, darling.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: At last, I’m back on top! Seventy pages in
one night! I’d say that just about breaks the record…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ellen? Is everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, sure. I’m just a little… dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I ought to give Clara something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Clara!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Come here, Clara! I’ve got something yummy
for you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, no! Martin!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Look at this! The dog! She’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: She was old.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Old?! Come look at this! She has wounds.
Wounds on her head. Like thrashes. Or bites.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Maybe an animal.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: An animal? What kind of animal? A goddamned
T-Rex, or what?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: She spent a couple of pleasant days with us,
and now she’s dead. That’s the way it is. I’m sorry. I have work to
do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Oh, Ellen! I’ve been wondering when
you’d come. Why don’t you step in.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: My husband is in his study in the
back.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I really hate to bother him, but…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Oh no, no. You’re not bothering him.
He has lots of time since he’s been retired.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You only draw flowers? A little unusual for a
former policeman.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: You know, after doing that job for so many
years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life. Flowers
incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life. But certainly, you’re
not here to chat about my hobbies.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: 1976. What happened back then?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Do yourself a favor: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I appreciate your concern, but we live in
that house. I need to know what happened in there.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: We found the wife about a week after she
had died, hunched in her TV-chair. Her husband was sitting in front of
her; the whole time, he sat in front of her dead body. A whole damn
week. Her death certificate says that she drowned, and her husband was
convicted, but God alone knows what really happened back then.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What made him do it?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That man, is he still alive? Where is he? Can
I talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Why don’t you just leave the past alone and
now go - please.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: If there’s one thing I’ve learned lately,
it’s that you can not run away from the past. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Ellen! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Frank Kosinski. Here’s the address. Go
see him. Ask him.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: That’s alright. Don’t misunderstand my
husband. It’s only that he’s already had enough problems with this case.
And who would believe him if he told the truth?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: But what is the truth?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: I don’t know all about what happened
back then. But it always stood between me and my husband.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Excuse me, I’m looking for Frank
Kosinski.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Kosinski… Oh - you mean K.K.!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Killer-Kosinski, that’s what they
call him around here. He did away with his wife.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I’m so glad you finally came. We’ve all
been waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You must be mistaking me. Where can I find
the man?</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: He’s in the closed psychiatry. This
here’s the open section. Go down the hall, third door to the left.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Are you doing better yet?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Poor girl. She only has two more days to
live, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What was that? What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What you just said, about the two days…</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I didn’t say anything!</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: I didn’t hear anything. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m sorry… I guess I was mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: He has his clear moments every now and then.
But I wouldn’t get my hopes up high.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mr. Kosinski?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mr. Kosinski, my name is Ellen Straub. I live
in your house out in Goldmoor… I mean, the house where you used to live.
There are a few questions I would like to ask you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mr. Kosinski! Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: 1976 - What happened back then? You…</p>
<p><strong>kosinski</strong>: “October 4, 1976. To this day, the
cold-blooded murder at the remote homestead continues to bring up
questions. Investigations have shown no satisfactory results. As was
announced by a police spokesman …”</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Never mind, it’s his usual number.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yes. That’s right. What happened back
then?</p>
<p><strong>kosinski</strong>: “… another unsolved mystery is the
question, why doors and windows had been nailed shut. The murder suspect
and only witness is still in a state of mental derangement. …”</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Okay, fine. I read that. It’s written in the
article. What I want to know is: What really happened back then?</p>
<p><strong>kosinski</strong>: “… Friends and family describe him as a
friendly, reliable husband. He had been forced into closing his small
trades business after bankruptcy. It is uncertain whether this might
have been cause for marital dispute…”</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: August 17, 1869.</p>
<p><strong>kosinski</strong>: “August 17, 1869. A messenger found
Mr. and Mrs. Eugen and Wilhelmine Meister dead in their house.”</p>
<p><strong>kosinski</strong>: “…The police constable in charge found no
traces. The motive of the crime remains a mystery…”</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Could I please speak with him alone for a
moment?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’ll be fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I am starting to get the impression that all
of this is some kind of bad joke: I’m seeing things that are not there,
my own husband is becoming a total stranger and your old friend Lindner
won’t tell me what he knows. I have no idea what you’re trying to prove
with this performance of yours, but I am not leaving this room before I
hear the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kosinski</strong>: It’s a grave.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: “…Execution in the moor…”</p>
<p><strong>kosinski</strong>: The moor… it’s one big grave.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Let me guess: Another short circuit?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hi, darling.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What is going on down there, anyway? Why am I
not supposed to go in the cellar?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I told you: It’s too dangerous. Besides, I
have to work now.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, we need to talk. I’ve done some
research. This lovely house of ours has a history of murder cases.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Anyone who ever lived in this house either
quickly moved back out, or fell victim to strange accidents, or ended up
killing each other.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I know you don’t believe me, but at least
hear me out. Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed that we’ve been going
through some strange changes since we moved here! We hardly talk to each
other any more, you’re writing like a madman and I’m having these
visions.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Here, look at this! Did you know that our
house is built right on a spot where during the Middle Ages people were
executed? They simply threw the convicts into the moors, alive.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: During the Middle Ages people were executed
at every corner. What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: This house, the whole damned area around here
is one mass grave… Now you might call me crazy, but there is something
negative about the place.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay, so the house has a history and there
might still be a couple of corpses in the moors. “There is something
negative about the place…” What the hell are you trying to say? Come on!
Spit it out!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s like… a sickness! And it’s gotten into
our heads.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Will you finally cut it out? Just in case
you haven’t noticed, I am trying to write a book here. And maybe - even
with your birdbrains - you can figure it’s a pretty tough job. So why
can’t you just leave me alone?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Damn it, look at you! Don’t you see what’s
happening with you? We need to get out of here, don’t you understand?
Out of this house!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Now let me work!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: To hell with your damned work!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t you dare…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin… oh my God… what’s happening to
us…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Clara…?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My son is dead…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My God, Tommi.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Didn’t I tell you not to go in the
cellar?!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, what-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s simply too dangerous here! But no, you
always have to have it your way.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You know what I have to do now, and believe
me: I don’t enjoy doing this.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of
me!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Of course you’ll give me the blame again.
Like back then. Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today -
isn’t that right, Ellen?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What are you talking about-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Enough of that! I know what I have to do
now.</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: Mrs. Straub!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’ve killed my husband!</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I think I’ve killed him. Martin, my husband,
I’ve killed him! That is, I’m not sure, but…</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: Mrs. Straub! Now calm down first.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It all went so fast. He was out of his mind
and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver. I only wanted to
defend myself. You have to call the police…</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: We can do all of that later, but first
you need to calm down.</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: Here, take this.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I… I don’t know which part of it all really
happened… It’s all one big nightmare…</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: You are going to sleep for a little
while, now. And then, we’ll talk about it more calmly and sift through
all of this.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Should we inform the authorities?</p>
<p><strong>prof. roth</strong>: Before everyone gets all nervous, why
don’t you call her house. Maybe that will clear things up.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Professor Roth?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hello, darling. Are you feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Shh… everything will be fine. Tomorrow, it
will all be over. Just don’t try to fight it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You stupid little bitch… think you can toy
around with people any old way you like. But not me, no.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh sweetheart, you’re awake already?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That really wasn’t very nice of you
yesterday. I always thought you loved me. You know, I bet any other
husband would be pretty upset with you now.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But I believe in our relationship. What are
such trifles compared to that.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, for heaven’s sake, tie me loose!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Believe me, I’d really like to. But I have
the feeling you’re not ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Ready? For what? This is crazy! Don’t you see
what’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The last day, Ellen. Today is the last day.
The circle is closing.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You knew!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, Ellen. My sweet Ellen… Of course I
knew.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: We loved each other once. Have you forgotten
that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, yeah? Did we really? Think about it,
Ellen…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Are you expecting company?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Make yourself comfortable. I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Good evening. Karl Lindner. I’m a friend of
your wife. Is she in?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ellen is home. But she isn’t feeling well.
Can I give her a message?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Oh, then I guess that makes my gift all the
more appropriate. Maybe I’ll just give it to her real quick and be on my
way again.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Um, I don’t think that’s a good idea. She
went to lie down. I think she’s already asleep. She’s been pretty busy
lately and needs to rest.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: So, what’s wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Just nerves. You know, the move and all
that…</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Well, then. Would you please give this to
her for me? Tell her, I’d like to talk to her when she’s feeling better.
And tell her I don’t want to run away anymore. She’ll understand what I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sure, I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Help! Help, I’m in here! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Is somebody trying to run away here?!
Darling, I’m really disappointed. How can we ever have a trusting
marriage if you keep running away from every conflict?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You little hardhead, I…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No matter what you do, Ellen… you don’t
stand a chance. We’re not leaving this place anymore…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: … not today. Not tomorrow. Never again!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s like you always wanted. Us together.
We’ll make it through anything, no matter how rotten the situation
is.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Have you ever wondered why it hasn’t been
working out between us since it all happened? I’ve asked myself that
question. And you know what the answer to that is? It was never real.
All just a big lie.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What you loved, was something totally
different. The successful author, Martin Straub. “Mr. Cherry-red Tears”
- you married a goddamned book.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: You went to see the Straubs’ today,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: I know you have something on your
mind. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: I think it’s starting again. You know…
there was something peculiar. If only I knew…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Peculiar? You mean, like back
then?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Yes, something was…</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: My God, the hammer!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Hammer?</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: How could I fail to notice that! - I have
to go…</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: I’m sorry, honey.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lindner</strong>: Go ahead. I know you have to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: … I know what you’re up to. You don’t think
that’s going to work, do you?</p>
<p><strong>telephone voice</strong>: Police headquarters, Webber…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Ellen Straub here. You have to help me…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: … please come right away! My address is…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: “Ellen woke up from the sound of the door.
She barely managed to raise her head in order to see who the visitor
might be. His back turned to Ellen, the man pulled a wheelchair into the
hospital room. When he turned around, she recognized him with horror:
Martin!”</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The final chapter will finish tonight. I bet
you can’t wait to find out how the story ends!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My God, Martin. I don’t understand all this.
How is it possible?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Do you like my new book? A real page-turner,
isn’t it? I can just see the critics: Martin Straub is back! And better
than ever.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Stay where you are! Not one step closer!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You still don’t understand, do you? Today is
the last day. Your day, Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The moor…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I told you, there is no way out. He won’t
let you go.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: ‘HE’? Whom do you mean-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Shh. Don’t you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s important - he knows the last
chapter.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Your book - that’s why you were always in the
cellar!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Now look at this young man: He supports me
in what I do - quite the opposite of you.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I
used to be.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: …So he’s dictating you a new bestseller?
Whatever that is, it’s not our son.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin, don’t you understand? Tommi is dead!
This… it knows our weaknesses and it’s using them to bring us apart!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m afraid he doesn’t like you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We’ve played this game long enough.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: How sad. Drowned, like all the others. But
that’s the way it’s got to be in a real horror novel. I know what you’re
thinking: No happy end - it’ll never sell. But to hell with
commerce!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s lying, don’t you see? This is all an
illusion. It lied to us and to all of those who were here before us…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’ll tell you what really was an illusion:
Romantic family life, by the side of your successful author. Sorry if I
wasn’t able to live up to your high expectations, princess.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It wasn’t your fault, you hear!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Tommi is dead, you hear! But you and me,
we’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I love you, Martin!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Then kill me, because… “With you, my life
began and with you shall it end…”</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I love you! Don’t let a lie come between us!
Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin! We have to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Hurry, we don’t have much time! Lift him up
higher!</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Ellen!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s right behind me.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: Don’t worry. It only has power over us if
we run away.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: No. Don’t look back.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Come! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Martin!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Smog…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I have a yearning for… smog, cars and many,
many people… A real dirty… big city. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re back.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: How did you get me out of there?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I wouldn’t have made it by myself.</p>
<p><strong>lindner</strong>: You were right: You can never run away from
the past. Especially if it scares you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Mr. Lindner!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Can you walk?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: For God’s sake, what happened to me?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You don’t remember?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s a long story.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What a sight: A few trees, a couple of ducks
in the pond. That’s all the nature I need.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Are you expecting company?</p>
<p><strong>paul and claudia</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This baby is a dream come true, I tell ya! The
third edition within one year!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Wow! - Considering how it all came about…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You two are one hell of a team! And as far as
I’m concerned: In case you plan on moving back to the countryside, I’ll
be glad to lend a hand.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Have you already told him about our idea for
the new novel?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah? What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s about this publisher who constantly gets
on his authors’ nerves.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …until one day, he goes too far and the two
of them get really mad…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: …and we mean: really mad!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay, okay, I get the message! I was only
trying to make a suggestion, you know.</p>
