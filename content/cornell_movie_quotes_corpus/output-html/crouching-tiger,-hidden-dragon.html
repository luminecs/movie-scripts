<p><strong>worker</strong>: Master Li is here!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and
handsome.</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: Shu Lien!</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: Li Mu Bai is here!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: How’s everything?</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: Fine. Please come in.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Mu Bai…It’s been too long.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: It has. How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Good. And how are you?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain. He
said you were practicing deep meditation.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: The mountain must be so peaceful… I envy you. My
work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I left the training early.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Why? You’re a Wudan fighter. Training is
everything.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: During my meditation training… I came to a place
of deep silence… I was surrounded by light… Time and space disappeared.
I had come to a place my master had never told me about.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You were enlightened?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: No. I didn’t feel the bliss of enlightenment.
Instead… I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn’t bear it. I
broke off my meditation. I couldn’t go on. There was something… pulling
me back.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Something I can’t let go of. You are leaving
soon?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: We’re preparing a convoy for a delivery to
Peking.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to
Sir Te for me.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: The Green Destiny Sword? You’re giving it to Sir
Te?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I am. He has always been our greatest
protector.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I don’t understand. How can you part with it? It
has always been with you.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Too many men have died at its edge. It only
looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You use it justly, you’re worthy of it.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: It’s time for me to leave it behind.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: So what will you do now?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword
to Sir Te yourself. It’ll be just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: First I must visit my master’s grave. It’s been
many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death.
And yet I’m thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Join me once you have finished. I can wait for
you in Peking.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: Ok. Pass.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Thanks. Let’s go into the city.</p>
<p><strong>giao</strong>: Everything got here safely. I’m much
obliged.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Just doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>giao</strong>: Sun Security has been the best since your
father started it. You’re a credit to his memory.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>giao</strong>: I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: This is Li’s personal sword, a great hero’s
weapon! He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it. It’s too
fine a gift. I cannot accept it.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as
glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he’ll never
be able to start anew.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: All right. I’ll act as the sword’s
custodian.</p>
<p><strong>de lu</strong>: Governor Yu has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: I must change.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You’ve always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.
Please accept our thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Please do not be such a stranger. You’ll
stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien… tell me something. And
forgive me for prying. Your father was a great friend to me, and I think
of you as my own daughter.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Please, Sir Te, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his
warrior days… maybe he’s trying to tell you something?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Don’t be coy. I’ve always known about your
feelings for each other. All these years, it’s a shame… neither of you
is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You’re both wasting
precious time.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren’t
cowards.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: When it comes to emotions, even great heroes
can be idiots. Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you
see him. I’ll give him an earful!</p>
<p><strong>de lu</strong>: Sir Te said to leave the sword in here.</p>
<p><strong>de lu</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’m your guest today. I am Governor Yu’s
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>de lu</strong>: This is Sir Te’s study. You are here to…</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I was looking for a quiet corner.</p>
<p><strong>de lu</strong>: I am Sir Te’s head servant. And this is
another of our guests.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: It’s heavy for such a thin piece of metal!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: The handle is heavy. And the blade is no
ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You’re just
not used to handling it.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: But I have had much practice. As a child in the
West, a platoon lived with us. They’d let me play with their weapons.
The scabbard is so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted
with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It’s 400 years old.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Exquisite! You said it belongs to…</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: My friend Li Mu Bai. He’s given it to Sir Te as
a gift.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he
give his sword to Sir Te?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You’re too young to understand.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You’re a sword fighter too?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain
moves, however, call for a sword.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be
totally free!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust,
integrity… Without rules, we wouldn’t survive for long.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’ve read all about people like you. Roaming
wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Writers wouldn’t sell many books if they told
how it really is.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: But you’re just like the characters in the
stories.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in
flea-infested beds… They tell you all about that in those books?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You know what I mean. I’m getting married soon,
but I haven’t lived the life I want.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: So I heard. Congratulations. It’s the most
important step in a woman’s life, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You’re not married, are you?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: No! You couldn’t roam around freely if you
were.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Go ahead, Governor Yu.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Two feet 9 inches long. 1 inch wide. The
handle is 1 inch deep, 2.6 inches wide. Seven-tenths of an inch thick.
With seven rubies missing from the hilt. You can tell the design dates
back to before the Chin era. Engraved with a technique lost by the time
of the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p><strong>governor yu</strong>: Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir
Te.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: A sword by itself rules nothing. It comes
alive only through skillful manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>governor yu</strong>: I see your point. Please continue.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: The Imperial Court isn’t the problem. With
royalty and officials everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps security tight.
But Peking is not like the West. Here, you’ll find all sorts of
characters. Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order. Don’t
depend only on the court. Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld can ensure
your position. Be strong, yet supple. This is the way to rule.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Governess…</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: Let me do it.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Please sit.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: I’ve made you silk pajamas. Do you want
to change into them?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Put them down.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: I heard you met Shu Lien today.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Do you know her?</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: She’s one of those. Your mother would not
want you consorting with her kind.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’ll socialize with whomever I please.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: Don’t invite danger into your father’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’m tired now.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: Go to bed then. Miss has grown up, and is
getting married soon. God knows what the future will bring.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: It will be just the same. Enough! I’m
tired.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: Autumn is coming. I’ll shut the windows
for you.</p>
<p><strong>master bo</strong>: Chilly, eh?</p>
<p><strong>nightman</strong>: Yes, Master Bo.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Someone help! Stop him! He’s on the roof! The
sword’s been stolen! Stop thief! Stop him!</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: It’s Jade Fox!</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: We must avenge mother!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Do something! He’s getting away!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Return the sword, and I’ll let you go.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You’ve been trained at Wudan?</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: You’re mistaken. We’re just street performers.
We were rehearsing.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: You were rehearsing? Who are you trying to
fool?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Where did that thief go?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Governor Yu’s house!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Get down here! Give back the sword!</p>
<p><strong>de lu</strong>: Sir Te awaits you.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I’m sure the thief is in the Yu household.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: How dare you imply?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: But I say –</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: – Enough.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Yes, though I doubt he’s involved in
this.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: But the sword could be in his compound.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Then someone’s trying to set him up. We
should inform Li Mu Bai.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Madam Yu, someone’s put up posters.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: Someone is after Jade Fox. Preposterous,
looking for her here!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t seen them in
two days.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: There is a Miss Shu Lien here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: Miss is busy right now.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Show her in.</p>
<p><strong>governess</strong>: This spells trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I have a guest.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: This way please.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’m bored.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You’re doing calligraphy?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’ll write your name. Just for fun.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I never realized my name looks like “sword.”</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar
to fencing.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Maybe it is. I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day
is near. You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’m hardly doing a thing. The less I think of
it the better. My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very
powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father’s
career.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You are fornuate to marry into such a noble
family.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Am I? I wish I were like the heroes in the
books I read. Like you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I’m happy to be marrying.
But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love… That is true
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Do you think so? Let me tell you a story.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: About you and Li Mu Bai?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be
married?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: No, really?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to
Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword
of Li Mu Bai’s enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot
together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we
dishonor Meng’s memory? So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.
But I have never tasted it.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Too bad for Meng, but it’s not your fault, or
Li Mu Bai’s.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I am not an aristocrat, as you are… but I must
still respect a woman’s duties.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Don’t distance us. From now on, let’s be like
sisters.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in
your marriage.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: What a godforsaken place! Can’t your
father be appointed closer to civilization? Jen… are you listening to
me?</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Wait! I’m a friend!</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: I don’t care about your sword.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Why were you spying on the Yus?</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: I’m looking for someone. Jade Fox. I’m a
police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district. Jade Fox is a master
criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus. She must have come with them
when they transferred here. But with Yu’s reputation, I can’t just go in
and accuse her.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: This Jade Fox is a woman?</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Then leave her to me.</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her. My
wife was quite a martial arts expert. Jade Fox killed her. So you see,
this is personal. Leave her to me.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: It’s ready!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I’m ready for anything!</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Father gets first dip.</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: They’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: “We’ll settle this at midnight on Yellow
Hill.” Good, the fox is out of her hole.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Shu Lien, look who’s here.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Sir Te believes it’s a ploy cast suspicion on
Governor Yu.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: But something is going on at the Yu
household.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: What have you discovered?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Jade Fox? Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You always suspected she’d fled to the West.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I didn’t think she’d dare come back to
Peking!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Is there any place safer than under the nose of
Governor Yu?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: So I shall avenge my master’s death after
all.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Be careful. Sir Te requires discretion. Official
business is difficult enough. Don’t let personal feelings make it worse.
And I don’t know… even this poster… could be some sort of trap.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Did you see who posted it?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu’s. On the night
of the theft there was a brawl near Yu’s. Were you involved?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: It was Bo, Sir Te’s man. I hear he followed the
thief to the Yus’.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Have you questioned him yet?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: No, not yet…</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: But your men are watching over Yu’s compund?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: No, I’d already sent them home. You can blame me
for losing the sword, but please trust that I’ll get it back soon using
my own methods.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: That’s not what I meant. I don’t care about the
sword.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: What do you mean? Didn’t you come back here for
it?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I don’t know it was stolen until I got here.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Then, why did you come?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Well, we had talked…</p>
<p><strong>de lu</strong>: Pardon my intrusion. Master Li, your room is
ready.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Thank you. Please lead the way.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: The fox doesn’t care much for punctuality. Still
no sign of her.</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: Enough! Show yourself.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Tsai… you dog! You will pay for your
stubbornness.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: That’s what you think, old witch!</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: If you surrender now, you’ll suffer less. But
if you resist, I won’t stop until you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Father! Let me avenge my mother’s death.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’ll soon end up like her, you little
whore!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: You’ll pay for that!</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: She’s going to paralyze you!</p>
<p><strong>tsai</strong>: May!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Tsai, you filthy mongrel! An ambush!</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Father, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago.
It’s been a long time, Jade Fox! You don’t remember me… But you should
remember my master. You infiltrated Wudan while I was away. You stole
our master! Now it’s time for you to pay!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your master underestimated us women. Sure, he’d
sleep with me, but he would never teach me. He deserved to die by a
woman’s hand!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: You stole the secrets of Wudan’s highest martial
arts. But after ten years of training, your moves are still
undisciplined. And today, under a Wudan sword… you will die!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Disciple, we’ll kill them all!</p>
<p><strong>figure in black</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Another one!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I must get rid of Tsai!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Who are you? Why is the Green Destiny in your
possession?</p>
<p><strong>figure in black</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green Destiny is mine.
Jade Fox can’t be your master. Where did you learn that “Xuan Piu”
move?</p>
<p><strong>figure in black</strong>: I’m just playing around.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Tell me, who is your master?</p>
<p><strong>figure in black</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We must kill them!</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Father!</p>
<p><strong>te</strong>: This is Tsai?</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: My father. Police Inspector from Shaan.</p>
<p><strong>te</strong>: This should be reported to Governor Yu. The
victim is an officer. You believe the killer is hiding out in his
compound.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I’d bet my life on it!</p>
<p><strong>te</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: This needs to be resolved, and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I’ll get into the Yu household and get her. I’ll
ferret out Fox and her gang.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: We must be careful. Governor Yu is a court
official, and in charge of security. Any disturbance will cast suspicion
on him. It might get Sir Te in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: This is a delicate matter.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam
Yu and her daughter?</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: What do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: The best way to trap a fox is through her
cubs.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with
these wedding gifts. She’s being so considerate.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I’m sorry she’s not feeling well enough to
receive you today.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: I heard Sir Te lost something. And now
Madame Te’s not feeling well…</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: We know who stole the missing item. If the thief
returns it, I’m sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: That’s good. Sometimes the help can’t keep
their hands to themselves. It’s very embarassing.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can
make mistakes… that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: But don’t be too lenient.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who
turned up in Peking.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: A murderer?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai’s own master.
Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: A female criminal! Now that’s news!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You say she killed a policeman?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Yes, from the West. He went undercover and and
followed her here,</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: Maybe the murderer and the thief are one
and the same.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I doubt it. This thief… it very unusual…</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: …And most likely smarter than a mere killer.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Greetings, Sir Te.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: Hello, Madam Yu. This is Li Mu Bai, the
renowned swordsman.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Delighted to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>te</strong>: Miss Yu is soon to be married.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Why don’t you come in?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I’m standing guard.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Come in. It’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>may</strong>: Come in. We don’t have to fear Jade Fox if
we’re together.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Isn’t it a bit too late to be out? You’ve
brought me the sword?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: I do as I please.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Where’s your master?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Had enough flying? You’ve got potential. You’ve
studied the Wudan Manual but you don’t understand it. You need a real
master.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Do you think you are a real master?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Like most things, I am nothing. It’s the same
for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Stop talking like a monk! Just fight!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Then tell me where Jade Fox is.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: On guard!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Real sharpness comes without effort.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: No growth without assistant. No action without
reaction. No desire without restraint. Now give yourself up and find
yourself again. There is a lesson for you.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Why should I? You need practice. I can teach you
to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in
stillness.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Why do you want to teach me?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I’ve always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan’s
secrets.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: And if I use them to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: That’s a risk I’m willing to take. Deep down,
you’re good. Even Jade Fox couldn’t corrupt you.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Wudan is a whorehouse! Keep your
lessons!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re home late… or should I say early?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Why are you still here? You killed a policeman.
You should leave! You’ll bring ruin on my whole family.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: They wouldn’t have found me if you hadn’t
stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?
You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don’t want
to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent…
As a master and disciple we will rule.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’ll never live as a thief!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’re already a thief.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where
would I go?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Wherever we want. We’ll get rid of anyone in
our way. Even your father.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It’s the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle… kill or be
killed. Exciting, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I owe you nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Yes, you do! You are still my disciple.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You think you’ve been teaching me all these
years from the manual? You couldn’t even decipher the symbols!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I studied the diagrams. But you hid the
details!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You wouldn’t have understood, even if I had
tried to explain. You know… you’ve gone as far as you can go. I hid my
skills so as not to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: If I hadn’t seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I’d
still be ignorant of all you’ve hidden from me.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Master… I started learning from you in secret
when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I
realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell
apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Believe me, I’ve a lesson or two left to teach
you!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: The sword is back… are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I admit, getting it back makes me realize how
much I’d missed it.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: But it’s not your sword anymore. You gave it to
Sir Te.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: True. But I must borrow it for one last mission.
Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when
you covered for that girl?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: My job was to get the sword back, without
embarassing anyone. I wasn’t about to ruin her life, or her
father’s.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: You did your job well. But, this girl… I saw her
last night.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I knew she would intrigue you.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: She needs direction… and training.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: She’s an aristocrat’s daughter. She’s not one of
us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You’ll kill Fox, and she’ll
marry.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: That’s not for her. She should come to Wudan and
become a disciple.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: But Wudan does not accept women.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: For her, they might make an exception. If not,
I’m afraid she’ll become a poisoned dragon.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: It’s not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her,
her husband might object.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I thought by giving away the sword, I could
escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I wish there were something more I could do to
help you.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Lo?</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Jen!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You shouldn’t have come.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: With all the traffic on your rooftop these days…
it took me a while to get in here. I can’t wait any longer. I was wrong
to let you go. Come back with me. You’ll be happy in the desert. You’ll
be free there.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You’ve been looking for me all this time?</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: Jen… stop playing with it.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I won’t break it.</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: It’s Dark Cloud! Dark Cloud is coming!</p>
<p><strong>madam yu</strong>: Lower the shade, don’t let them see
you!</p>
<p><strong>dark cloud</strong>: Don’t touch the women!</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Come get your comb.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Hurry back to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: She’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Let’s stop a moment.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Give it back!</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: You’re tired. You need rest. Your horse needs
water. There’s a creek up here.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Well, there used to be! What’s your name? I’m
Lo. The Hans call me Dark Cloud. I’m not that tall or big, but I’m quick
as lightning.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: My comb!</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: If you like that arrow, I can make you a bow.
Great for hunting wild chicken. They’re delicious.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: You need to eat, understand? Then you’ll have
the strength to fight. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: You’re eating too fast. Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: You’ve got quite a temper. It’s better this
way.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You coward!</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Still in a bad mood? At least you’re speaking.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: I didn’t think the Hans had names like that.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Relax. If I had wanted to, I would already have
done it. You must be dying for a bath. Fresh water’s hard to get here.
But I managed to bring some up. You can wear my clothes when you’re
done. They’re clean. Don’t worry. I’ll sing, so you’ll know where I am.
After the bath, you’ll be calmer.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: No more hitting on the head! All this trouble
for a comb?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: It’s mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian
like you wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my
horse.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: By the way, I’m a real Manchurian.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: I’m sorry… I guessed wrong. I though you were a
Han.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Give me back my comb.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: I don’t take orders from anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Give it back.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand
shooting stars. I thought, where did they all go? I’m an orphan. I used
to look for stars alone. I thought if I rode to the other end of the
desert, I’d find them. I’ve been riding in the desert ever since.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: And so, the little boy became a fearsome
bandit. He couldn’t find the stars, so he stole my comb.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Out here, you always fight for survival. You
have to be part of a gang to stand a chance. Slowly, your gang becomes
your family. All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make
my life easier.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: So you’re still that little boy looking for
shooting stars.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: I am a man. And now I’ve found the brightest
star of all.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Your father’s men are looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Your father’s men are still looking for you.
They’re still out there, circling closer.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Let them look.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: It is trouble for me.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Don’t send me back!</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: You must decide. You might get tired of this
life. You might begin to miss your family. If it were our daughter, we’d
look for her too. She would miss us. Jen… I want you to be mine forever.
I will make my mark on the world. I will earn your parents’ respect. We
have a legend. Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will
grant his wish. Long ago, a young man’s parents were ill, so he jumped.
He didn’t die. He wasn’t even hurt. He floated away, far away, never to
return. He knew his wish had come true. If you believe, it will happen.
The elders say, “A faithful heart makes wishes come true.”</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Keep it safe. Return it to me when we are
together again.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: If you don’t, I’ll come after you. And I won’t
let you off so easy.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Wherever I went, someone always recognized me. I
really tried. Later, I heard you came to Peking. I was afraid I’d never
see you again. So I came. I can’t let you marry.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Jen…</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Don’t ever come back.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: So it’s over?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: We heard noises.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: It was just a cat.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You think Jade Fox will show up?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: She’s out there, but I doubt she’ll show
herself. We’ll keep our eyes open. Sooner or later, she’ll come for the
girl.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Jen! Come with me! You’re mine!</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: Come with me to the desert! Jen! Come with me to
Xin Jiang!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Where is Jade Fox?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Come with me! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You thought she’d give it all up and go back
West with you?</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: She’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Either way, you are no good to her dead. With
the Gou and Yu clans hunting you, you’ll soon be in their hands.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: I don’t care anymore.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: If you truly loved her, you wouldn’t say
that.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Don’t you want to see her again.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: All right. I’ll write you an introduction. Take
it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>sir te</strong>: When will this end? They take it, they put
it back, they take it again. My home is turning into a warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>te</strong>: Speak!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Jen has run away! Gou found the wedding chamber
empty. Governor Yu requests your assistance. You know the Giang Hu
underworld. He wants to find her, and keep her from harm.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Sir Te, leave this to us. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What can I serve you?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: The cup is dirty.</p>
<p><strong>gangster a</strong>: Hello. What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Long.</p>
<p><strong>gangster b</strong>: It’s young Master Long. My apologies.
I’m Iron Eagle Sung and this is my brother in arms, Flying Cougar Li
Yun. What brings you to Huai An, and where are you headed, Master
Long?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Anywhere there’s action.</p>
<p><strong>gangster a</strong>: In that case, perhaps we could be of
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>gangster a</strong>: You don’t seem to understand.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: So what if I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>gangster b</strong>: We have ways of helping you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>gangster a</strong>: Are you related to Li Mu Bai?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: He is my defeated foe!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Have some tea.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Shu Lien… The things we touch have no
permanence. My master would say… there is nothing we can hold on to in
this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Not everything is an illusion. My hand… wasn’t
that real?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Your hand, rough and callused from machete
practice… All this time, I’ve never had the courage to touch it.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full
of corruption… I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us
only trouble.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: To repress one’s feelings only makes them
stronger.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: You’re right, but I don’t know what to do. I
want to be with you… just like this. It gives me a sense of peace.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Please follow me.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I want a clean room.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: We have plenty. Your order?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Steamed whole cod, bite-size meatballs, a
little starchy, but keep the sauce light, shark fin soup, mixed
vegetables, and some warm wine.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I have to order from a bigger
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Hurry then.</p>
<p><strong>giang hu a</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>mi biao</strong>: I am Iron Arm Mi. I heard a true master has
arrived. I have come to seek a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>mi biao</strong>: You asked for it!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: What kind of Iron Arm are you?</p>
<p><strong>flying machete chang</strong>: You have amazing technique! I
am Flying Machete. Are you related to Southern Crane?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Southern Duck? I don’t eat anything with two
feet. Who could remember such long-winded names?</p>
<p><strong>gou jun sihung</strong>: Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
you don’t know his master, Southern Crane?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>gou jun sihung</strong>: I’m Shining Phoenix Mountain
Gou.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Gou? I hate that name. It makes me puke! Too
bad you’re named Gou. You’ll be the first to feel my sword today.</p>
<p><strong>monk jing</strong>: Hold it! Don’t you know Monk Jing?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: A monk, in a place like this? You need a
lesson!</p>
<p><strong>monk jing</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Who am I? I am… I am the Invincible Sword
Goddess. Armed with the Incredible… Green Destiny. Be you Li or Southern
Crane… lower your head… and ask for mercy. I am the desert dragon. I
leave no trace. Today I fly over Eu-Mei. Tomorrow… I’ll kick over Wudan
Mountain!</p>
<p><strong>flying machete chang</strong>: We politely asked for a
friendly match, but she showed no respect, and attacked us. Everyone
came by to teach her a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>mi biao</strong>: Her sword was just too powerful.</p>
<p><strong>monk jing</strong>: I’ve traveled everywhere, but never met
anyone so uncivilized.</p>
<p><strong>shining phoenix mountain god</strong>: She kept accusing me
of being Gou Jun Pei’s brother. Who is this Gou, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Her husband.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: We’re close to your headquarters. Go home and
check in.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I’ll look around and catch up later.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Not a bad idea. Tonight we’ll get a good night’s
sleep at headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>security man a</strong>: Mistress, you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: It’s you! How’s everything here?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Fine. You’ve been gone a while.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Yes, and I leave again tomorrow. Your wife was
due?</p>
<p><strong>ah wai</strong>: Yeah, a baby girl.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>ah wai</strong>: I’ll be happy if she’s half as strong as
you.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Mrs. Wu…</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: You’re back!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: How’s the arm? Still sore?</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: Much better. You’ve been gone so long.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: I’ll go and make up his room!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Sister Shu Lien…</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Here you must be in proper attire.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I’m just borrowing some clean clothes. I’m not
staying.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I’ll give them to you.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I was just passing by and wondered how you
were.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You, sister…</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Look at the trouble you’ve caused. Now you know
what Giang Hu life is really like. If you think of me as your sister,
let me give you some sisterly advice. You can run from marriage, but not
your parents.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: They forced me to marry!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Go back to them first. Then you can decide about
Lo.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You know about Lo?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: He really loves you. Come back to Peking with
me. We’ll find a solution.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to
Wudan Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: You’re working together to set me up! I’m
leaving!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had
stolen the sword! I’ve done nothing but protect you and your family. And
you’re repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared
you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you’ve
ruined it all! You’re no sister of mine!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: What do I care? You were never a real friend
anyway. But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Put the sword down!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Jen!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Everyone out. Shut the doors.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Fine… the friendship is over.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Don’t touch it! That’s Li Mu Bai’s sword.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Come and get it if you can.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Don’t be a sore loser. Go ahead. Take your
pick. I’ll wait. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Give me the sword.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Take it!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Stop it! You don’t deserve the Green
Destiny.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Not another lecture! On guard!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Let’s end this here.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Only the sword will settle this.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I only let you go because I wanted to see the
real you.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: What do you know about a true heart?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: What I’ve always wanted, to teach you.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: All right. If you can take back the sword in
three moves, I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Give it back!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Kneel!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Then you have no use for the sword.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Sooner or later, they’d drag you back to
Peking. Your parents will never accept you again. But why go home? We’ve
gone this far, we won’t stop now. You’ll always be my lady. At last,
we’ll be our own masters. We’ll be happy. That’s the most important
thing. All we have left is each other, right? Lie down and rest.</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: She’s crazy. You should have killed
her.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: I didn’t have the heart.</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Is it me or the sword you want?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: You’ve been drugged!</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Where is Jade Fox?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: We followed Jade Fox.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: And so you die.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: And so shall you!</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: A poisoned needle!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You deserve to die, but the life I was hoping
to take… was Jen’s. Ten years I devoted to you. But you deceived me! You
hid the manual’s true meaning. I never improved… but your progress was
limitless! You know what poison is? An eight-year-old girl, full of
deceit. That’s poison! Jen! My only family… my only enemy…</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: You can’t die! Tell us what poison you used! You
can’t die! Tell us the antidote! You can’t let Li Mu Bai die!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: She used Purple Yin… Purple Yin poison. It goes
straight to the heart.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: My blood will soon reverse its flow. It’s the
same poison she used to kill my master. There is no antidote.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: That can’t be! Everything has an antithesis! Why
not this?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The
formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have
helped me, let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: All right. Hurry. I will hold on as long as I
can.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this
to Mrs. Wu. She’ll help you. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Spare your energy. I’ll be back!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Where is Mrs. Wu?</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Shu Lien told me to show you this.</p>
<p><strong>aunt wu</strong>: Let her in.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope…</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: Shu Lien…</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Save your strength.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: My life is departing. I’ve only one breath
left.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Use it to meditate. Free yourself from this
world as you have been taught. Let your soul rise to eternity with your
last breath. Do not waste it… for me.</p>
<p><strong>li</strong>: I’ve already wasted my whole life. I want to
tell you with my last breath… I have always loved you. I would rather be
a ghost, drifting by your side… as a condemned soul… than enter heaven
without you. Because of your love… I will never be a lonely spirit.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: He’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Bo… please take this sword back to Sir Te.</p>
<p><strong>yu</strong>: Now you must go to Wudan Mountain. Lo awaits you
there. Promise me one thing, whatever path you take in this life… be
true to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Do you remember the legend of the young
man?</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: “A faithful heart makes wishes come true.”</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: Make a wish, Lo.</p>
<p><strong>lo</strong>: To be back in the desert, together again.</p>
