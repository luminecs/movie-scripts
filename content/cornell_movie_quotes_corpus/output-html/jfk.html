<h1 id="jfk">jfk</h1>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: January, 1961 - President Dwight D.
Eisenhower’s Farewell Address to the Nation -</p>
<p><strong>eisenhower</strong>: The conjunction of an immense military
establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American
experience. The total influence - economic, political, even spiritual -
is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the Federal
Government… In the councils of government we must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the
military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of
misplaced power exists and will persist… We must never let the weight of
this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We
should take nothing for granted…</p>
<p><strong>voice 2</strong>: November, 1960 - Senator John F. Kennedy of
Massachusetts wins one of the narrowest election victories in American
history over the Vice- President Richard Nixon by a little more than
100,000 votes. Rumors abound that he stole the election in Illinois
through the Democratic political machine of Mayor Daley… At his
inauguration, at a time when American males all wore hats, he let his
hair blow free in the wind. Alongside his beautiful and elegant wife of
French origin, Jacqueline Bouvier, J.F.K. is the symbol of the new
freedom of the 1960’s, signifying change and upheaval to the American
public, scaring many and hated passionately by some. To win the election
and to appease their fears, Kennedy at first takes a tough Cold War
stance.</p>
<p><strong>voice 3</strong>: He inherits a secret war against the
Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba, a war run by the CIA and angry
Cuban exiles out of bases in the Southern United States, Panama,
Nicaragua and Guatemala. Castro is a successful revolutionary
frightening to American business interests in Latin America - companies
like Cabot’s United Fruit, Continental Can, and Rockefeller’s Standard
Oil. This war culminates in the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in April
1961, when Kennedy refuses to provide air cover for the exile brigade.
Of the 1600 men who invade, 114 are killed, 1200 are captured. The Cuban
exiles and the CIA are furious at Kennedy’s irresolution… Kennedy,
taking public responsibility for the failure, privately claims the CIA
lied to him and tried to manipulate him into ordering an all-out
American invasion of Cuba. He vows to splinter the CIA into a thousand
pieces and fires Director Allen Dulles, Deputies Charles Cabell and
Richard Bissell, the top leadership of the Agency.</p>
<p><strong>voice 4</strong>: The CIA, however, continues it’s secret war
on Castro with dozens of sabotage and assassination attempts under it’s
ZR/RIFLE and MONGOOSE programs - The Agency collaborates with organized
crime elements such as John Roselli, Sam Giancana, and Santos
Trafficante of Tampa, whose casino operations in Cuba, worth more than a
hundred million dollars a year in income, Castro has shut down.</p>
<p><strong>voice 5</strong>: In October 1962, the world comes to the
brink of nuclear war when Kennedy quarantines Cuba after announcing the
presence of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles 90 miles off American
shores. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the CIA call for an invasion.
Kennedy refuses. Soviet ships with more missiles sail towards the
island, but at the last moment turn back. The world breathes with relief
but backstage in Washington, rumors abound that J.F.K. has cut a secret
deal with Russian Premier Khrushchev not to invade Cuba in return for a
Russian withdrawal of missiles. Suspicions abound that Kennedy is “soft
on Communism.”</p>
<p><strong>voice 6</strong>: In the ensuing months, Kennedy clamps down
on Cuban exile activities, closing training camps, restricting covert
operations, prohibiting shipment of weapons out of the country. The
covert arm of the CIA nevertheless continues its plan to assassinate
Castor… In March ’63, Kennedy announces drastic cuts in the defense
budget. In November 1963, he orders the withdrawal by Christmas of the
first 1000 troops of the 16,000 stationed in Vietnam. He tells several
of his intimates that he will withdraw all Vietnam troops after the ’64
election, saying to the Assistant Secretary of State, Roger Hilsman,
“The Bay of Pigs has taught me one, not to trust generals or the CIA,
and two, that if the American people do not want to use American troops
to remove a Communist regime 90 miles from our coast, how can I ask them
to use troops to remove a Communist regime 9,000 miles away?”… Finally,
in August 1963, over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the
United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union sign a treaty banning
nuclear bomb tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in space… Early
that fateful summer, Kennedy speaks of his new vision at American
University in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>jfk</strong>: What kind of peace do we seek? Not a pax
Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war… We must
re-examine our own attitudes towards the Soviet Union… If we cannot now
end our differences at least we can help make the world safe for
diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic link is that we
all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all
cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: They’re going up to Dallas… to whack Kennedy.
Friday the 22nd, that’s when they’re going to do it. In Dealey Plaza.
They’re gonna whack him! You gotta call somebody, these are serious
fuckin’ guys.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Higher’n a kite on something. Been like this
since she came in.</p>
<p><strong>voice 7</strong>: More rumors emerge of J.F.K.’s backdoor
efforts outside usual State Department and CIA channels to establish
dialogue with Fidel Castro through contacts at the United Nations in New
York. Kennedy is seeking change on all fronts. Bitter battles are fought
with Southern segregationists to get James Meredith into the University
of Mississippi. Three months after Kennedy submits a sweeping civil
rights bill to Congress, Martin Luther King leads 250,000 in a march on
Washington. Robert Kennedy, as Attorney General, for the first time ever
vigorously prosecutes the Mafia in American life, bringing and winning a
record number of cases - 288 convictions of organized crime figures
including 13 grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and his Teamsters Union.
The President also takes on Big Business, forcing back steel prices,
winning 45 of 46 antitrust cases during 1963 and he wants to help
everyday taxpayers by ending age- old business privileges like the oil
depletion allowance and the fees paid to the Federal Reserve Bank for
printing America’s currency. Revolutionary changes are foreseen after
J.F.K.’s assumed re-election in 1964. Foremost in the political
consciousness of the country is the possibility of a Kennedy dynasty.
Robert Kennedy in ’68, Teddy Kennedy in ’76. In November, 1963 John
Kennedy travels to Texas, his popularity sagging to 59% largely due to
his civil rights stand for which he is particularly hated in the South.
Texas is a crucial state for him to carry in ’64. With him is
Vice-President, Lyndon Johnson and Texas Governor John Connally. On
November 21, they visit Houston and San Antonio. On the morning of
November 22, he speaks in Fort Worth, then flies 15 minutes to Love
Field in Dallas, where he takes a motorcade through downtown Dallas on
his way to speak at 12:30 at the International Trade Mart. Later, the
motorcade takes him through Dealey Plaza at 12:30…</p>
<p><strong>ambulance voice</strong>: We are en route to Parkland.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’ll be there in about five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jackie kennedy</strong>: And in the motorcade, you know I
usually would be waving mostly to the left side and he was waving mostly
to the right, which is one reason you’re not looking at each other very
much. And it was terribly hot. Just blinding all of us… We could see a
tunnel in front of us. Everything was really slow then. And I remember
thinking it would be so cool under that tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. connally</strong>: Mr. President, you can’t say that
Dallas doesn’t love you.</p>
<p><strong>jfk</strong>: No, you certainly can’t.</p>
<p><strong>cbs bulletin</strong>: We interrupt this program to bring you
this flash bulletin. A burst of gunfire! Three bursts of gunfire,
apparently from automatic weapons, were fired at President Kennedy’s
motorcade in downtown Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>oh no! my god they’re going to kill</strong>: US ALL! Be
still. You’re going to be all right. LET’S GET OUT OF HERE.</p>
<p><strong>jackie kennedy voice</strong>: Oh, no, they’ve shot Jack… I
love you, Jack… Jack… they’ve killed my husband…</p>
<p><strong>cbs bulletin</strong>: The first reports say that President
Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting. More details just
arrived. United Press say the wounds to President Kennedy perhaps could
be fatal. Repeating: President Kennedy has been shot by a would-be
assassin in Dallas. Three bursts of gunfire, apparently from automatic
weapons…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’s wrong, Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Boss, the President’s been shot. In Dallas.
Five minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh no!… How bad?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: No word yet. But they think it’s in the
head.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on. Napoleon’s has a TV set.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 1</strong>: Apparently three bullets were found.
Governor Connally also appeared to be hit. The President was rushed by
the Secret Service to Parkland Memorial Hospital four miles from Dealey
Plaza.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There’s still a chance, dammit! Come on, Jack -
pull through.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I don’t believe it. I don’t believe it.
Here, in this country.</p>
<p><strong>walter cronkite</strong>: From Dallas, Texas - the flash
apparently official, President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard
Time, 2 o’clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.
Vice-President Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not
know to where he has proceeded. Presumably, he will be taking the oath
of office shortly, and become the 36th President of the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I didn’t always agree with him - too liberal
for my tastes - but I respected him. He had style… God, I’m ashamed to
be an American today.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 2</strong>: Many arrests have been made here today.
Anyone looking even remotely suspicious is being detained. Most of the
crowd has gone home but there are still many stunned people wandering
around in Dealey Plaza unable to comprehend what happened here earlier
today.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: It’s all so terrible. I jes’ can’t stop
crying. He did so much for this country, for colored people. Why?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I grabbed my kids and wife and hit the ground.
The bullets were coming over our heads - from that fence back on the
knoll - I was just so shaken. I saw his face when it hit… he just, his
ear flew off, he turned just real white and then went stiff like a board
and flopped over on his stomach, with his foot sticking out.</p>
<p><strong>woman 2</strong>: I thought… it came from up there, that
building.</p>
<p><strong>man 2</strong>: I heard shots from over there.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 2</strong>: How many shots?</p>
<p><strong>woman 3</strong>: About 3 to 4… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>man 3</strong>: I never thought it could happen in
America.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!
They’re grieving like they knew the man. It makes me want to puke.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: God’s sake, chief. The President was
shot.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: A bullshit President! I don’t see any
weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death
and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians
and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by
Kennedy’s communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I’m
telling ya Jack, that’s what happens when you let the niggers vote. They
get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding
heart.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Chief, maybe you had a little too much to
drink.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: Bullshit! Bartender, another round… Here’s
to the New Frontier. Camelot in smithereens. I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>television insert</strong>: image of a Dallas policeman
hauling a Mannlicher - Carcano rifle with a sniperscope over the heads
of the press gathered in the police station.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 3</strong>: This is the rifle, it is a Mannlicher -
Carcano Italian rifle, a powerful World War II military gun used by
infantry and highly accurate at distances of 100 yards.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 3</strong>: The assassin apparently fired from this
perch… but so far no word, much confusion and…</p>
<p><strong>newsman 4</strong>: A flash bulletin… the Dallas Police have
just announced they have a suspect in the killing of a Dallas police
officer, J.D. Tippit, who was shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff, a suburb of
Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>television insert</strong>: Lee Harvey Oswald, a bruise over
his right temple, is apprehended at the Texas Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 4</strong>: The suspect, identified as Lee Harvey
Oswald, was arrested by more than a dozen police officers after a short
scuffle at the Texas movie theatre in Oak Cliff, several blocks from
where Officer Tippit was killed, apparently with a .38 revolver found on
Oswald. There is apparently at least one eyewitness.</p>
<p><strong>television insert</strong>: Oswald is booked at the station.
A surly young man, 24, he claims to the press:</p>
<p><strong>tv oswald</strong>: No, I don’t know what I’m charged with… I
don’t know what dispatches you people have been given, but I
emphatically deny these charges.</p>
<p><strong>voice from the bar</strong>: They oughta just shoot the
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what
he can do.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s get outta here, Lou. I saw too much stuff
like this in the war.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right? I
said Oswald must’ve flipped. Just did this crazy thing before anyone
could stop him, right?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I think I’ll cut out here, chief. I gotta
get home.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: Get home my ass. We’re going to the
office, have another drink. I want some company tonight.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: Who’d ever thought that goofy Oswald kid
would pull off a stunt like an assassination? Just goes to show, you can
never know about some people. Am I right, Jack? Well, bless my soul.
Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack. Don’t tell me we have
another bleeding heart here. Hell, all these years I thought you were on
my side.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Chief, sometimes I don’t know whether you’re
kidding or not.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: I couldn’t be more serious, Jack. Those
big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: Who the hell opened my files! You’ve been
looking through my private files, haven’t you, you weasel?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You may not like this, chief, but you’re
beginning to act paranoid. I mean, you really are.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: You found out about Dave Ferrie going to
Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.
You’re a goddamn spy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to
look in your files? I saw enough here this summer to write a book.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: I always lock my files. And you were the
only one here today… What do you mean, you son of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You know what I mean. I saw a lot of strange
things going on in this office this summer. And a lotta strange
people.</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: You didn’t see a goddamn thing, you little
weasel. Do you get it? You didn’t see a goddamn thing.</p>
<p><strong>television image</strong>: Reporters are jammed in the
Assembly Room of the Dallas Police Headquarters as Oswald is brought
through the corridor, officers on either side of him.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 5</strong>: Did you shoot the President?</p>
<p><strong>tv oswald</strong>: I didn’t shoot anybody, no sir. I’m just
a patsy.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: My god, he sure looks like a creep. What’s he
talkin’ ’bout… a patsy?</p>
<p><strong>television image</strong>: Oswald in front of the cameras, on
a platform.</p>
<p><strong>tv oswald</strong>: Well, I was questioned by a judge.
However, I protested at the time that I was not allowed legal
representation during that very short and sweet hearing. Uh, I really
don’t know what the situation is about. Nobody has told me anything
except that I am accused of, uh, murdering a policeman. I know nothing
more than that and I do request that someone come forward to give me,
uh, legal assistance.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 5</strong>: Did you kill the President?</p>
<p><strong>tv oswald</strong>: No. I have not been charged with that. In
fact nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it
was when the newspaper reporters in the hall, uh, asked me that
question.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 6</strong>: You have been charged.</p>
<p><strong>tv oswald</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>newsman 6</strong>: You have been charged.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 5</strong>: Were you ever in the Free Cuba Movement
or whatever the…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It was the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 6</strong>: What did you do in Russia? What happened
to your eye?</p>
<p><strong>tv oswald</strong>: A policeman hit me.</p>
<p><strong>garrison</strong>: He seems pretty cool to me for a man under
pressure like that.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Icy, you mean. He gives me the willies… come on
sugarplums, it’s past your bedtimes… Come on, let’s go upstairs. Mattie
- get ahold of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Why, Mr. Jim? He was a great man, Mr. Jim, a
great man…</p>
<p><strong>television image</strong>: Texas D.A. Henry Wade addresses
the journalists.</p>
<p><strong>tv wade</strong>: There is no one else but him. He has been
charged in the Supreme Court with murder with malice. We’re gonna ask
for the death penalty.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So several hours after the assassination, a
disturbed portrait is emerging of Lee Harvey Oswald. Described as shy
and introverted, he spent much of his childhood in New Orleans,
Louisiana and went to high school there. After a stint in the Marines,
he apparently became fascinated by Communism and in 1959 defected to the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He married a Russian woman there, Frank, had a
child, and then returned to the United States after 30 months. But he is
still believed to be a dedicated Marxist and a fanatical supporter of
Fidel Castro and ultra left wing causes. He spent last summer in New
Orleans and was arrested in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And apparently, Bob, Oswald had been passing
out pro-Castro pamphlets for an organization called Fair Play for Cuba,
a Communist front he reportedly belongs to.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: And we have Marina Oswald, his Russian- born
wife, who has identified the rifle found in the Book Depository as
belonging to her husband. And we have…</p>
<p><strong>television images</strong>: Kennedy’s casket coming off the
plane in Washington D.C. play under the newsman… Jackie stands there in
her blood-spotted dress… we cut to the photograph of L.B.J. taking the
oath of office earlier that day… and a still photo of Robert Kennedy’s
reaction…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Lou, I’m sorry to disturb you this late… yeah,
matter of routine but we better get on this New Orleans connection of
Oswald’s right away. Check out his record, find any friends or
associates from last summer. Let’s meet with the senior assistants and
investigators day after tomorrow, Sunday, yeah, at 11… Thanks Lou.</p>
<p><strong>marina oswald</strong>: Lee good man… he not shoot
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: As far as Oswald’s associates, boss, the one
name that keeps popping up is David Ferrie.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know David - a strange character.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: He’s been in trouble before. Used to be a hot
shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged
homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Get Kohlman… he told somebody the Texas trip…
yesterday mentioned to somebody about Ferrie… find it out.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 1</strong>: These backyard photos were found
yesterday among Oswald’s possessions in the garage of Janet William’s
home in Riving, Texas, where Marina Oswald and her children are living.
The picture apparently was taken earlier this year. Police say the
rifle, a cheap World War II Italian- made Mannlicher-Carcano, was
ordered from a Chicago mailing house and shipped to Oswald’s alias A.
Hidell at a post office box in March, 1963. This is the same rifle that
was used to assassinate the President.</p>
<p><strong>cox</strong>: That ties it up…</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Another nut. Jesus, anybody can get a rifle in
Texas.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So it seems that Dave Ferrie drove off on a
Friday afternoon for Texas - a source told Kohlman he might have been a
getaway pilot for Oswald.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hold your horses. What kinda source?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The anonymous kind, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>oser</strong>: I think I remember this guy Ferrie speaking at
a meeting of some veteran’s group. Ranting against Castro. Extreme
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 1</strong>: We go back now to the basement of police
headquarters where they’re about to transfer Oswald to County
Prison…</p>
<p><strong>television image</strong>: The basement of the Dallas police
headquarters - waiting. Men mill around as Oswald is led out of the
basement by two deputies. Jack Ruby rushes forward out of the crowd -
and into history - putting his sealing bullet into Oswald. Total chaos
erupts…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: He’s been shot! Oswald’s been shot!</p>
<p><strong>various voices</strong>: Goddamn! Look at that… Look at that…
I don’t believe this… Right on TV! What is going on? Who is this guy… oh
Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Seventy cops in that basement. What the hell
were they doing?</p>
<p><strong>newsman 1</strong>: Jack Ruby… Who is Jack Ruby? Oswald is
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Well, no trial now. Looks like somebody saved
the Dallas D.A. a pile of work.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, let’s get Ferrie in here anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Chief… David Ferrie.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come in, Dave. Have a seat, make yourself
comfortable. Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison? I met you
on Carondolet Street right after your election. I congratulated you,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How could I forget? You make quite a first
impression. Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee? I’ve heard
over the years you’re quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you
can get in and out of any field, no matter how small… I’m a bit of a
pilot myself, you know. Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the
war.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How could I? Dave, as you know, President
Kennedy was assassinated on Friday. A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was
arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named
Jack Ruby. We’ve heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New
Orleans and we’ve been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: That’s not true. I never met anybody named
Oswald. Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air
Patrol unit when he was a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: No… if he did, I don’t remember him. There
were lots of kids in and out… y’know.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m sure you’ve seen this. Perhaps you knew
this man under another name?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: No, I never saw him before in my life.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well that must’ve been mistaken information we
got. Thanks for straightening it out for us. There is one other matter
that’s come up, Dave. We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly
after the assassination of Friday.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Yeah, now that’s true. I drove to
Houston.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What was so appealing about Houston?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: I hadn’t been there ice skating in many
years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we
wanted to go ice skating.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating
in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent
thunderstorms in recent memory?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing…
the storm wasn’t that bad.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I see. And where did you drive?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: We went straight to Houston, and then
Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why Galveston?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: No particular reason. Just to go
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And then Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: In the morning we went goose hunting. Then
headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I
stayed in Hammond.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did you bag any geese on this trip?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: I believe the boys got a couple.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But the boys told us they didn’t get any.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they’re
right. We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.
But you couldn’t approach them. They were a wise bunch of birds.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Your young friends also told us you had no
weapons in the car. Dave, isn’t it a bit difficult to hunt for geese
without a shotgun?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I’m
sorry, I got confused. We got out there near the geese and it was only
then we realized we’d forgotten our shotguns. Stupid, right? So of
course we didn’t get any geese.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I see. Dave thank you for your time. I’m sorry
it has to end inconveniently for you, but I’m going to have you detained
for further questioning by the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Why? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dave, I find your story simply not
believable.</p>
<p><strong>fbi spokesman</strong>: Gentlemen, this afternoon the FBI
released David W. Ferrie of New Orleans. After extensive questioning and
a thorough background check, the Bureau found no evidence that…</p>
<p><strong>fbi spokesman</strong>: …Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald or
that he has had any connection with the assassination of President
Kennedy. The Special Agent in Charge would like to make clear that
Mr. Ferrie was brought in for questioning by the District Attorney of
Orleans parish, not by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau
regrets any trouble this may have caused Mr. Ferrie…</p>
<p><strong>newsman 9</strong>: In national news, President Johnson has
announced the creation of a blue ribbon presidential commission to probe
the events in Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Correct me if I’m wrong. I thought we were on
the same side. What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Pretty fast, wasn’t it. The way they let him
go.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They must know something we don’t. So, let’s
get on with our lives, gentlemen… we got plenty of home grown crimes to
prosecute.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 9</strong>: The Commission will be headed by Chief
Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren, and is expected
to head off several Congressional and Texas inquiries into the
assassination. On the panel are Allen Dulles, ex-chief of the CIA,
Representative Gerald Ford, John J. McCloy, former head of Chase
Manhattan Bank…</p>
<p><strong>senator russell long</strong>: That’s a mess down there, Jim.
We’ve bitten off more “Vietnam” that we can possibly chew.</p>
<p><strong>long</strong>: Sad thing is the way it’s screwing up this
country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people
look you can’t tell a boy from a girl anymore. I saw a girl the other
day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what
she painted on it? “Love Child.” It’s fuckin’ outa control. Values’ve
gone to hell, Jim… Course it figures when you got somebody like that
polecat Johnson in the White House.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I sometimes feel things’ve gone downhill since
John Kennedy was killed, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>long</strong>: Don’t get me started on that. Those Warren
Commission fellows were pickin’ gnat shit out of pepper. No one’s gonna
tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned
bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Here you go, Senator Long.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make
sure it could be done?</p>
<p><strong>long</strong>: Sure, three experts and not one of them could
do it! They’re telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class
precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and
accordin’ to his Marine buddies he got Maggie’s drawers - he wasn’t any
good. Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the
first shot would always be the best. Here, the third shot’s perfect.
Don’t make sense. And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all
over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One
“pristine” bullet? That dog don’t hunt.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know, something always bothered me about
that from day one, and I can’t put my finger on it.</p>
<p><strong>long</strong>: If I were investigatin’, I’d round up the 100
best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that
day. You been duck hunting? I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned
decoy. What’d he say? “I’m just a patsy.” Out of the mouth of babes
y’ask me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You think there were other men involved,
Russell?</p>
<p><strong>long</strong>: Hell, you’re the District Attorney. You read
the Warren Report - and then you tell me you’re satisfied Lee Oswald
shot the President all by his lonesome.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Russell, honestly you sound like one of those
kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire. I just can’t believe
the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something
that wasn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>long</strong>: Honey, another one of these. This one’s as
weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam’s gonna
cost Johnson ’68 and it’s gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then
watch your hide, ’cause there ain’t no offramps on a freeway to
Hell!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Jim, dinner’s just about ready… I’ve got a
surprise for you… tried something new… Jim? Jim, dinner.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mmmmm… sure smells good… but Egghead, do you
realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the
assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?
I can’t believe it. A police captain with 30 years experience and a
crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything
that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Come on now, we’ll talk about it at the table,
dinner’s getting cold. What are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Daddy said it was all right if I was real
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure it is. Freckle Face, if I ever handled a
minor felon like that, it’d be all over the papers. I’d catch hell. And
this is the alleged murderer of the President?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Again and again they ignore credible testimony,
leads are never followed up, its conclusions are selective, there’s no
index, it’s one of the sloppiest, most disorganized investigations I’ve
ever seen. Dozens and dozens of witnesses in Dealey Plaza that day are
saying they heard shots coming from the Grassy Knoll area in front of
Kennedy and not the Book Depository behind him, but it’s all broken down
and spread around and you read it and the point gets lost.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: I never did believe it either!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Uh huh… Mattie, I’ll do the dishes, you take Be
up now. And Elizabeth, too, your bedtime, honey.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth jr.</strong>: Nahhhh! I don’t wanna go to bed!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Honey, that was three years ago - we all tried
so hard to put that out of our minds, why are you digging it up again?
You’re the D.A. of New Orleans. Isn’t the Kennedy assassination a bit
outside your domain? I mean all those important people already studied
it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I can’t believe a man as intelligent as Earl
Warren ever read what’s in those volumes.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Well maybe you’re right, Jim. I’ll give you one
hour to solve the case… until the kids are in bed. Then you’re mine and
Mr. Kennedy can wait ’til morning. Come on, everybody say goodnight to
Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Dad, look what I drew.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s something, Jasper. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: A rhinoceros. Can I stay up another
hour?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Pickle and Snapper, my two favorite dancing
partners.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Goodnight, my doodle bugs.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Goodnight, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: One hour, y’hear? Some Saturday night date you
are. Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious
man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, she did, huh? When I come up I’ll show you
how Saturday night got invented.</p>
<p><strong>bowers</strong>: I sealed off the area, and I held off the
trains until they could be examined, and there was some transients taken
on at least one train.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Mr. Bowers… is there anything else you
told me I haven’t asked you about that you can think of?</p>
<p><strong>bowers</strong>: Nothing that I can recall.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Witness is excused.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harkness</strong>: Well we got a long freight that was
in there, and we pulled some people off of there and took them to the
station.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: You mean some transients?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harkness</strong>: Tramps and hoboes.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Were all those questioned?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. harkness</strong>: Yes, sir, they were taken to the
station and questioned.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: I want to go back to this Amos Euins.</p>
<p><strong>bowers</strong>: Yes sir, traffic had been cut off into the
area since about 10, but there were three cars came in during this time
from around noon till the time of the shooting… the cars circled the
parking lot, and left like they were checking the area, one of the
drivers seemed to have something he was holding to his mouth… the last
car came in about 7 to 10 minutes before the shooting, a white
Chevrolet, 4-door Impala, muddy up to the windows.</p>
<p><strong>bowers</strong>: Towards the underpass, I saw two men
standing behind a picket fence… they were looking up towards Main and
Houston and following the caravan as it came down. One of them was
middle-aged, heavyset. The other man was younger, wearing a plaid shirt
and jacket.</p>
<p><strong>bowers</strong>: There were two other men on the eastern end
of the parking lot. Each of ’me had uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>bowers</strong>: At the time of the shooting there seemed to
be some commotion… I just am unable to describe - a flash of light or
smoke or something which caused me to feel that something out of the
ordinary had occurred there on the embankment…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: Four shots… a puff of smoke came from the
trees… behind that picket fence… close to the little plaza - There’s no
doubt whatever in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>dreamscape flashback</strong>: We see the Zapruder film, in
slow-motion and J.F.K.’s face just before he goes behind Stemmons
Freeway sign. Jim sits up suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Honey, you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s incredible, honey - the whole thing. A
Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian
language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he
defects to the Soviet Union. A Russian exam!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I cannot believe this. It’s four- thirty, Jim
Garrison. I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and
…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Honey, in all my years in the service I never
knew a single man who was given a Russian test. Oswald was a radar
operator. He’d have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for
pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: These books are getting to your mind,
Mr. Garrison. I wish you’d stop readin’ them.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And then this Colonel tries to make it sound
like nothing. Oswald did badly on the test, he says. “He only had two
more Russian words right than wrong.” Ha! That’s like me saying
Touchdown here… …is not very intelligent because I beat him three games
out of five the last time we played chess.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Jim, what is going on, for heaven’s sake! You
going to stay up all night every night? For what? So you’ll be the only
man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Liz, do I have to spell it out for you? Lee
Oswald was no ordinary soldier. That was no accident he was in Russia.
He was probably in military intelligence. That’s why he was trained in
Russian.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Honey, go back to sleep, please!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Goddammit! I been sleeping for three years!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Will you stop rattling on about Kennedy for a
few minutes, honey… come on.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Morning, boys. Ready for a walking tour?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: At 7:30 Sunday morning? It’s not exactly fresh
blood we’re sniffing here, boss.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Remember whose office this was back in ’63? 531
Lafayette Street.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah, Guy Banister. Ex-FBI man. He died couple
years ago.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Headed the Chicago office. When he retired he
became a private eye here. I used to have lunch with him. John Birch
Society, Minutemen, slightly to the right of Attila the Hun. Used to
recruit college students to infiltrate radical organizations on campus.
All out of this office. Now come around here, take a look at this…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: 544 Camp Street. Same building as 531
Lafayette, right… but different address and different entrances both
going to the same place - the offices on the second and third
floors.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Guess who used this address?</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: See this? What the hell is this doing on
this piece of paper? Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: My God! Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bull’s-eye. How do we know he was here? Cause
this office address was stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he was handing
out in the summer of ’63 down on Canal street. They were the same
leaflets that were found in his garage in Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He was arrested that day for fighting with some
anti-Castro Cubans… but actually he had contacted them a few days
earlier as an ex-Marine trying to join the anti-Castro crusade. When
they heard he was now pro-Castro, they paid him a visit.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: He’s a traitor, this man! Don’t believe a
word he tells you! You sonofabitch, you liar, you’re a Communist, go
back to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: Okay, Carlos, if you want to hit me, hit
me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There was no real fight and the arresting
Lieutenant later said he felt it was a staged incident. In jail, Oswald
asked to talk to Special Agent John Quigley of the FBI who showed up
immediately. They have a private session. Oswald is released and Quigley
destroys his notes from the interview.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But the arrest gets him a lot of publicity and
as a result Oswald appears on a local TV debate that established his
credentials as a Communist.</p>
<p><strong>bringuier</strong>: But you’re a Communist, are you not, and
you defected to Russia.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: No, I am not a Communist. But I am a
Marxist-Leninist.</p>
<p><strong>bringuier</strong>: What did you do when you were in
Russia?</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: I worked while I was there. I was always
under the protection of… that is to say, I was not under the protection
of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What the hell’s a Communist like Lee Oswald
doing working out of Banister’s?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Y’ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I’m
beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist… after the arrest, 544
Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again. Now here’s another
one for you: What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been
trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’d say he was probably getting intelligence
training.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Lou, you were in the Marines. Who would be
running that training?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: The Office of Naval Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Take a look across the street.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Post Office.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Upstairs. In 1963 that was the Office of Naval
Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was
ONI. What do they say?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: “Once ONI, always ONI”?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, he likes to work near his old pals.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bill, Lou, we’re standing in the heart of the
United States Government’s intelligence community in New Orleans. That’s
the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI. Doesn’t this seem to you a
rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What are you driving at, boss?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We’re going back into the case, Lou - the
murder of the President. I want you to take some money from the Fees and
Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people. Bill, I want you
to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby
histories, tax records…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Lord, wake me, please. I must be dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, you’re awake, Bill, and I’m dead serious.
And we’re going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from
three years ago. How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that
day?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re not under cross-examination here,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Here’s my problem, Jack. You told me you and
Guy were good friends for a long time?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: More than ten years.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And he never hit you before?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Never touched me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the
President’s murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a
.357 Magnum. But the police report says you had an argument over the
phone bill. Here, take a look at it. Now, does a simple argument over
phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, it involved more than that.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How much more?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t know if I should talk about
this.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, I’d ask Guy - we were friendly, you know
- heart attack, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: If you buy what you read in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You have other information?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I didn’t say that. All I know is he died
suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why did Guy beat you, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, I guess now that Guy’s dead, it don’t
really matter… it was about the people hanging around the office that
summer. I wasn’t really part of the operation, you know. I was handling
the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but
that’s why I was there… it was a nuthouse. There were all these Cubans
coming and going. They all looked alike to me.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Dave Ferrie - you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Was he there often?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Often? He practically lived there. It was
real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea
was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba.
Banister’s office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas,
through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All this right under the noses of the
intelligence community in Lafayette Square?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sure. Everybody knew everybody. It was a
network. They were working for the CIA - pilots, black operations guys,
civilians, military - everybody in those days was running guns
somewhere… Fort Jefferson, Bayou Bluff, Morgan City… McAllen, Texas was
a big gun-running operation.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where is Banister in all this?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Banister was running his camp north of Lake
Pontchartrain. Ferrie handled a lot of the training. There was a
shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba. A few
Americans got trained, too. Nazi types. Mercenaries. But Ferrie was the
craziest.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Anyway, late summer the party ended. Kennedy
didn’t want another Bay of Pigs mess, so he ordered the FBI to shut down
the camps and confiscate the napalm and the C-4. There were a buncha
Cubans and a couple Americans arrested, only you didn’t read about it in
the papers. Just the weapons got mentioned… ’cause the first ones behind
bars would’ve been Banister and Ferrie, but I think the G-men were just
going through the motions for Washington. Their hearts were with their
old FBI buddy Banister.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Like I said, a fuckin’ nuthouse.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah, he was there, too… sometimes he’d be
meeting with Banister with the door shut. Other times he’d be shooting
the bull with Ferrie. But he was there all right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Anything more specific, Jack? It’s
important.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah, one time the secretary got upset, I
remember…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I can’t believe it, Mr. Banister. Lee
Oswald is down on Canal Street giving out Communist leaflets supporting
Castro!</p>
<p><strong>banister</strong>: It’s okay, Delphine, he’s with us.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Anyone else involved at Banister’s level?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: There was one guy, I don’t know, big guy,
business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He
looked out of place, y’know - like a society guy. Can’t remember his
name. Oswald was with him.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He had something to do with money. I
remember him cause Guy, who didn’t kiss anybody’s ass, sure kissed
his.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Clay something, that was his name -
Clay.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bertrand. Clay Bertrand?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah! That’s it. I don’t know. Maybe it
wasn’t. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Clay Bertrand. He’s in the Warren Report. He
tried to get Oswald a lawyer. Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sure. ’Course they hated the sonofabitch,
but…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The assassination, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Never. Not with me sir, never… Listen, I
think I’d better go. I said enough. I said all I’m going to say.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hold on, Jack. What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What’s the problem? What’s the problem? Do I
need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison? I better go.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nobody knows what we’re talking about,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You’re so naive, mister.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, it’s a terrific yard, Chief, but the
man’s an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile
piss.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Does that bother you, Bill? I always wondered
in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad
eyesight.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’ll never sign a statement, boss, let alone
get on a witness stand.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: When something’s rotten in the land, Bill, it
generally isn’t just one fish, we’ll get corroboration… find this Clay
Bertrand. If I were a betting man, I’d give you 10 to 1 it’s an alias.
Start checking around the Quarter.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And the six of us, with almost no budget and
in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with
dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn’t solve. We can’t
keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in
Orleans Parish too. I didn’t pick you because of your legal skill, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Gee, thanks boss.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But because you’re a fighter. I like a man who
isn’t scared of bad odds.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: How ya doing, Mr. Garrison? Remember me
- from the piano bar at the Royal Orleans?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I sure do. We sang “You’re the Cream in My
Coffee.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Make sure we come back here, now.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Mr. Garrison, we have not seen enough of
you lately.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Been too busy, Paul - an elected man can’t have
as much fun as he used to. Welcome back, Lou. Find out anything on those
hobos?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: They took ’em to the Sheriff’s office, not the
police station, and they let ’em go. No record of them ever being
questioned.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I can’t say that comes as a surprise
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got
some great shots of them never published…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …take a good look, chief, do any of ’em look
like the hoboes you remember?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their
clothes - these two look pretty young.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …not a single frayed collar or cuff, new
haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear
of the cop… That’s a wire. What’s a cop wearing a headset for? I think
they’re actors, chief; they’re not cops.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who the hell are they, then! Hi, Susie, sit
down. This could be it. Let’s start looking for ’em.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Graveyard dead. August this year. A single car
accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas. The doctor said he was
in some kind of strange shock when he died.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We need to find more witnesses, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: There was Rose Cheramie. A whore. Two Cubans
threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Can we find her?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in ’65.
Two in the morning on some highway. A hit and run.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why not go right to the horse’s mouth,
chief?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: If we go to him our investigation’ll hit the
front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face. Ruby was just given a
new trial. If he has something to say, it’ll be there. Susie, what did
you find out on Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Negative on his tax records. Classified.
First time I know a D.A. can’t get a tax record. I put together a list
of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and
asked for them. There are about 1200 documents… Oswald in the USSR, in
Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from
the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can’t get one of them.
All classified as secret on the grounds of national security. It’s real
strange.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe there’s more to this, Susie. The CIA’s
keeping something from our enemies.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Yes, but we’re talking about a dead warehouse
employee of no political significance. Three years later and he’s still
classified? They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his
pubic hairs… Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.
Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants
to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17. He learns Russian, he
acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he’s stationed at a top
secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate. He’s
discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother’s sick. He
stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he
goes to Moscow…</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: I want to renounce my citizenship and become
a Soviet citizen. I’m going to make known to them all information I have
concerning the Marine Corps and my specialty therein, radar
operation…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: One of the consuls, John McVickar, says
Oswald’s performance was not spontaneous - it seemed coached. Oswald
gives an interview to a journalist.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: I will never return to the United States for
any reason. It is a capitalist country, an exploitive, racist country. I
am a Marxist since I was 15. I’ve seen poor niggers and that was a real
lesson. People hate because they’re told to hate, like school kids. It’s
the fashion to hate people in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: The Russians are skeptical - want to send him
back. Maybe they suspect he’s a spy. He supposedly slashes his wrists in
a suicide attempt so that they’re forced to keep him, and he disappears
for six weeks, presumably with the KGB.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory
in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he’s given
5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local
girls.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Makes sense - he’s a spokesman.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: But he never writes, speaks, or does any
propaganda for the Russians. He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he’s Russian
the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Didn’t someone say he didn’t speak good
Russian?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.
The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar
secrets. Or fake secrets.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I don’t know if it’s coincidence, but Oswald
had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days
at Atsugi Air Base in Japan. Six months after he arrives in Russia,
Francis Gary Powers’ U2 spy flight goes down in Russia. That plane was
untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could’ve given the Russians
enough data to hit it. As a direct result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed. I can’t help thinking of that book
Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn’t want the Peace
Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that. It gets
weirder.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Susie, you’re an assistant D.A., remember.
Stick to what you can prove in court.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: You want facts, Bill? Okay. From 1945 to ’59
only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia. From ’59 to ’60, seven defect,
six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald. All of
them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t get sidetracked! How does he get back to
the States? That’s the point. Does he have any problems?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: None! The State Department issues him a new
passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel. He’s never
investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information
or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This is a man whose secrets cause us to change
our radar patterns in the Pacific! He should’ve been prosecuted as a
traitor!</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: The FBI finally gets around to talking to him
in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But who meets him when he gets off the boat in
New York in June ’62?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an
anti-Communist group.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And Marina? Does she have a problem getting
out?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: None either. It’s bizarre. It’s next to
impossible to get Russian sweethearts out. Nor does Lee have any problem
getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in ’63. A
man who has defected once already. It’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dammit, it doesn’t add up! Ordinary people get
blacklisted for leftist affiliations! The State Department did
everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald’s
return. Only intelligence people can come and go like that.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: The next thing we know he’s living in
Dallas/Ft. Worth in October ’62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles-
Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S.
Army… He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian
missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes. Oswald may have had access to
missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a
young man who’d been in the Army Security Agency.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to
George Washington’s cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy
with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti-
Communists.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: His closest friend is an oilman named George
de Mohrenschildt who’s about 35 years older than Oswald, who’s only 23
and supposedly broke. De Mohrenschildt is a member of the Dallas
Petroleum Club, speaks five languages and was in French Vichy
Intelligence during the War. Also rumoured to have been a Nazi
sympathizer and member of the “Solidarists”, an international anti-
Communist organization with many Eastern Europeans and ex-Nazis, many of
them brought here by the CIA after the war, many of them involved in oil
and munitions interests in Dallas and the Southwest. You figure it.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Where’d you get all this Nazi stuff?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Read it. They called it “Project
Paperclip.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This is the guy that keeps turning up in
colonial countries and each time something strange happens. Coup
d’etats, presidents overthrown. He shows up on a “walking tour” of
Guatemala’s Cuban invasion camps just before the Bay of Pigs invasion.
If we don’t know he’s CIA, let’s circle him very probable - Oswald’s
handler.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: I think he’s made some mistakes on Cuba, but
he’s doing a pretty good job. If he succeeds, in my opinion, he’ll be a
great President. And a really attractive one too - open features, great
head of hair…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: De Mohrenschildt draws a picture of Oswald as
an intellectual, well read, speaks excellent Russian, a man who adored
J.F.K.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s scenery. Don’t get sidetracked. This is
the man, bottom line, who nailed Oswald to the Warren Commission as a
potentially violent man, and linked him to the rifle.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So, Lee, what are you taking a potshot at
this week - rabbits or fascists?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: The only Russian that suspects Oswald of
still being a Communist is Anna Meller. But her Russian friend tells her
“he’s checked” with the local FBI and was told Oswald is all right.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: The Oswalds are introduced by George de
Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams. It’s through Janet Williams in
October ’63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street
at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to
defense and military intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect
stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: All I can find out about the Williams’ is
their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of
the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United
Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which
requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing
visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with
General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after
the War for our missile program. He used slave labor to build the V-2
Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I wonder about the Williams’. Just where did
the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44? No one knows. They
claimed it was Brennan’s, but his description came after 1 P.M. Who
called? Somehow the FBI’s been tapping the Williams’ and picks up a call
between Bell Helicopter and Janet’s phone, an unidentified voice saying
“We both know who’s responsible.” Who called? Why’s the Bureau been
tapping them?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: His wife, Janet Williams, studied Russian in
college and her father worked for the Agency for International
Development, which works hand in hand with the CIA. She suddenly becomes
Marina’s best friend. Marina fights often with Lee about many things -
his secrecy, the lack of money. She says Lee is not sexually adequate.
Lee hits her on several occasions. Bill Williams’ convenient separation
from Janet allows Janet to invite Marina to move into her house in
Irving. There Marina and Lee have a second daughter - while Lee, now 24,
stores his belongings in Janet’s garage and rents a small room in Dallas
under an alias of “O.H. Lee”.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: When he’s arrested, Marina buries him with
the public. Her description of him is that of a psychotic and violent
man.</p>
<p><strong>marina</strong>: I do not want to believe, but I have too
much facts.. tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, after, they take her to Six Flags Inn in
Arlington, prepare her for the interviews, teach her how she should
answer - and after two months and 46 interviews, she has a nervous
breakdown. Oswald was no angel, that’s clear, but who was he?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m lost, boss. What are we saying here?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We’re saying that when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some
kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he
died, that’s what we’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And therefore because Oswald pulled the
trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in
chief. That’s what you’re saying!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll go you one better! Maybe Oswald didn’t
even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn’t even
fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn’t even
bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He had his palm print on the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn’t find
a goddamn thing. It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas
police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he
could’ve taken off Oswald at the morgue. There’s no chain of evidence,
Bill. And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository? One
an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described
by Deputy Weitzman… Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he
said he was Bill - “a patsy”. Take it at face value. Lou, Susie, I’m
going with my gut here. He’s got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle,
“O.H. Lee” to rent the room, right? What’s in a name, right? In
intelligence, they’re assumed to be fake. A name is sort of like a
postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name,
right? Then why can’t somebody be using Oswald’s name?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: To frame him, obviously. You got to get in your
minds how the hell spooks think, Bill! They’re not ordinary crooks.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I never could figure out why this guy orders a
traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store
in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can
never be traced.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Unless he or someone else wants him to get
caught. Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou. Somebody else did. It
was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald’s time sheet
shows him clocked in at his job. Lou, come alive. These things are not
adding up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I still have to question what the legal basis
is that supports this, boss. Susie’s stuff is colorful, but…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s start making some assumptions about the
man. Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald’s? This is
not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one. Who found the
evidence? Who set him up? Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and
check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in
the summer and fall of ’63 - see if it’s the same guy.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Boss, Oswald impersonators? Sounds like James
Bond now.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Al, you can’t tell a mink from a coonskin
unless you see the fur up close. Goddamn, Sam! If we don’t start reading
between the lines here! Y’all gotta start thinking on a different level
- like the CIA does. We’re through the looking glass. Here white is
black and black is white.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What do you think, Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m just an investigator, Bill. I leave the
theories to you lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You, Numa?</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: A week ago I would’ve said this is nuts, but
now … There’s a lot of smoke there, but there’s some fire.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Now you guys, come on. You’re talking about
the United States Government here!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We’re talking about a crime, Bill. No one is
above the law. Reduce it. A crime was committed. Let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Christ, what the hell kinda needle is that? I
just got a cold for Chrissake. I don’t want any shot!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Please relax, Mr. Ruby. This’ll calm you
down and clear this up.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Doc, I’m telling you, I don’t need any
shots.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mr. Ruby, I don’t want to involve the
guards. It’ll just take a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Then do you understand that I cannot tell the
truth here? In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to
tell the truth… who do not want me to have a retrial?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Mr. Ruby, I really can’t see why you can’t
tell us now.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: When are you going back to Washington,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: I am going back very shortly after we
finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Can I make a statement? If you request me to
go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear
further testimony from me, can you do that? Can you take me with
you?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby.
There are a good many things involved in that.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Well, the public attention it would
attract. And we have no place for you there to be safe, we’re not law
enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair,
Mr. Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: But if I am eliminated there won’t be any way
of knowing. Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take
over this country, and I know I won’t live to see you another time. My
life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Well I don’t know what can be done,
Mr. Ruby, because I don’t know what you anticipate we will
encounter.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Then you don’t stand a chance, Mr. Chief
Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and
you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth
serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will
not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth… And then I want to
leave this world.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Why you keep dancing on my head for, my
man? We been thicker’n molasses pie since law school.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your
testimony to the Warren Commission and…</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: There you go. Grain of salt. Two sides to
every coin.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You tell them the day after the assassination
you were called on the phone by this “Clay Bertrand” and asked to fly to
Dallas and be Lee Oswald’s layer.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Now that’s pretty important, Dean. You also
told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two. Then you tell the
Commission he was five foot eight. How the hell did the man shrink like
that, Dean?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: They put the heat on, my man, just like
you’re doing. I gave’em anything that popped into my cabeza. Truth is, I
never met the dude.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I don’t know what the cat looks like and
furthermore I don’t know where he’s at. All I know is sometimes he sends
me cases. So one day he’s on the phone talkin’ to me about going to
Dallas and repping Oswald… Hey, pipe the bimbo in red. What ever
happened to that little gal you was dating in the Quarter - from
Opelousas, y’know, elevator didn’t go to the top floor but tits could
smother gumbo with.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half
as cute as you, Deano. You shoulda tried a legitimate line of
business.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You can’t ever say crime don’t pay in
Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to. Good chowder, ain’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: When did you first do business with this
Bertrand?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving
about him back in ’56, ’57 when I lived down in the Quarter.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Street cats?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Swishes. They swish, y’know. Young fags,
you know. They’d come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I’d
say, hey man, I ain’t Rockefeller, who gonna back you up? These
cornmuffins go to the phone and dial…</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The dude on the other end says…</p>
<p><strong>clay bertrand</strong>: I’m Clay Bertrand. Whatever they owe,
I guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Hey, suits me fine, Daddy Warbucks - how do
I get in touch with you?</p>
<p><strong>clay bertrand</strong>: I’m around.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: And that’s how I first heard of Clay
Bertrand.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What was his voice like?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You knew you weren’t talking to some low
life fag, you know. He had command of the king’s English.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did he pay?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Always - like tits on a pig. I wish I had a
million of those bimbettes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Like I told to the Washington boys,
Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his
Marine discharge…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So you saw Oswald how many times?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Three, four. He came in with a few Cubano
swishes one time I remember…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Recall any names?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and
I wear clothes. Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it’s Butsie. I wish I
could help you, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Hell, no! I told this Bertrand cat right
off, this isn’t my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I’m a hack in
nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Then how the hell did you get in the Warren
Commission, Dean? Except through the phone records in the Dallas
jail?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: There were no phone records.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Of course there weren’t. ’Cause they
disappeared. And yet the Commission found you, Dean.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I don’t know how they got to me. Maybe
cause I repped him here. The Feebees run background checks. On my mama’s
breasts, man, that’s all I got. There wasn’t no conspiracy, Jim. If
there were, why the hell didn’t Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney
General, he was his brother for Chrissake. How the fuck three people
could keep a secret like that, I don’t know. It was Oswald. He was a nut
job. Faggot, y’know, hated this country.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dean, I think we’re having a communication
problem. I know you know who Clay Bertrand is. Now stop eating that damn
crabmeat for a minute and listen. I’m aware of our long friendship, but
I want you to know I’m going to call you in front of a grand jury. I
took nine judges on, Deano, right here in New Orleans, and I beat ’em
all. If you lie to the grand jury as you’ve been lying to me, I’m going
to charge you with perjury. Now, am I communicating with you?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Is this off the record, Daddy-o? In that
case, let me sum it up for you real quick. If I answer that question you
keep asking me, if I give you the name of the “Big Enchilada”, y’know,
then it’s bon voyage, Deano - I mean like permanent. I mean like a
bullet in my head. You dig? Does that help you see my problem a little
better? You’re a mouse fighting a gorilla. Kennedy’s dead as that crab
meat. The government’s still breathing. You want to line up with a dead
man?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Read my lips, Deano. Either you dance into the
Grand Jury with the real identity of Clay Bertrand or your fat behind is
going to the slammer. Do you dig me?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’re just as crazy as your mama. Goes to
show it’s in the genes! Do you have any idea what you’re getting into,
my man? You think Jack Ruby just up and died of cancer in four weeks
after he gets a retrial? That’s some kinda new cancer - I’d say that’s a
“going out of business cancer”. You got the right ta-ta, but the wrong
ho-ho. The government’s gonna jump all over your head, Jimbo, and go
“cock-a-doodledoo!”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: District Attorney Garrison to see Prisoner
5388, Ward Block 237B.</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: Send him on in.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: …we don’t need no gates out there, sir, we
got the “swamp”. Many of ’em gone in there but none come out… Hey,
Willie!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You got some company, wants to talk wid you.
You behave now, boy, y’hear.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I want to thank you, Mr. O’Keefe, for this
time.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Call me Willie. I ain’t got nuthin’ but
time, Mr. Garrison. Minutes, hours, days, years of’em. Time just stands
still here like a snake sunnin’ itself in the road…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Clay Bertrand, Willie?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Yeah. Clay. I met him sometime in June of
’62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express
reason to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: For sexual purposes?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Well… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did he pay you for this?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Twenty dollars each time. Hell, it’s no
secret. That’s what I’m here for.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Anything else unusual about him you’d be able
to describe in a court of law, Willie?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: I remember he had some kinda thing wrong
with his left leg. He limped. Don’t get me wrong, he’s not one of those,
you know, limp wrists. He’s a butch John. You’d meet him on the street,
you’d never snap. You could go fishing with him, play poker with him,
you’d never snap in a million years. So one night we were over at
Ferrie’s place. Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of ’63.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: …there were about nine or ten people,
Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was
a mess. Dave’s mind was a mess, Y’know he had all those mice cages
around cause he’s working on this cure for cancer… Dave’s smart - real
smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military
history, politics. He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him
’cause he was queer…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And that’s where you met Oswald for the first
time?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Yeah, strange guy. Dave introduced him
as…</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Willie, say hello to Leon Oswald.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: How ya doing?</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: What the fuck’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Fuck you, man.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Leon’s in a bad mood, don’t get excited,
he’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Would you say this “Leon” was actually Lee
Harvey Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Fuck, yes. Hell, I’m already in jail. I got
no reason to lie to you. I ain’t no nigger.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Go on, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: …well the party got crazier and crazier,
one of those, y’know “beatnik” type things.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: We’re having a little meeting here. That’s
Castro. Sounds like Hitler doesn’t he? Sonofabitch is going to go. Real
soon.</p>
<p><strong>cubans</strong>: Muerte a Fidel! Muerte!</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: Oh, stop it already! What are all these
people doing here anyway? I can’t bear all this infernal noise.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Clara, don’t be so sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: I didn’t come here for a pep rally. Get
all this riffraff out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: …finally they got out of there and I found
myself alone with Dave and this Leon, two of the Cubans, and this guy
Bertrand. Dave pulled out his clippings which he was always carrying
around. He’d been obsessed with Castro and Kennedy for months and he
started in again…</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Kennedy fucked us in ‘61, ’62, and he’s
fuckin’ us now! And that fuckin’ zealot Bobby Kennedy is the fuckee! The
nerve of that little asswipe closing the camps. Took all our C- 4! Took
ten thousand rounds, 3,000 pounds of gunpowder, all our weapons. Next
we’ll be living in a world where only the cocksucking Reds will have all
the weapons and we’ll be surrounded. If we want a free Cuba, we gotta
whack out the fucking beard.</p>
<p><strong>cuban</strong>: That faggot Kennedy won’t let us. Our hands
are empty - how can we kill him?</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: walks with a slight</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Bullshit! There’s all kinds of new stuff. I
heard about rockets in an umbrella - they’re tested at Fort Detrick? I
can show you a dozen poisons. Stick it in his food, he’ll die in three
days, no trace. We can put something in his beard, make it fall out,
he’ll look fuckin’ ridiculous without his beard.</p>
<p><strong>cuban</strong>: Why don’t we just take care of the main
problem? Which is that piece of shit Kennedy. He’s doing all kinds of
deals! Kissing Khrushchev’s ass. I wouldn’t even call him President
Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: …then the Cubans left and the bullshitting
was going on, Dave was drunk, really drunk and he starts in with Kennedy
again.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: See, what Kennedy done, with him you should
take a knife and stab and kill the fucker where he is now. I mean it.
This is true. But I tell you something. I hope I get a week’s notice.
I’ll kill. Right in the fuckin’ White House. Somebody’s got to get rid
of this fucker.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Oh, c’mon, Dave, you’re never gonna get
that sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: No? It won’t be long, mark my words. That
fucker’ll get what’s coming to him. And it can be blamed on Castro. Then
the whole country’ll want to invade Cuba. All we got to do is get
Kennedy in the open.</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: David, David, always some harebrained
scheme or another… Oh? What do I see here? Oooooh, let’s have some more
champagne, shall we!</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: What about the Secret Service, the
cops?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: No problem if it’s planned right. Look how
close they got with de Gaulle. Eisenhower was always riding around in an
open top. I know somebody who actually went up and touched Eisenhower
once. We need to have three mechanics at three different locations. An
office building with a high-powered rifle. Triangulation of crossfire is
the key. You get the diversionary shot gets the Secret Service looking
one way - Boom! You get the kill shot. The crucial thing is one man has
to be sacrificed, then in the commotion of the crowd the job gets done
and the others fly out of the country to someplace with no extradition.
I could do that myself. I could fly to Mexico, and then Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>bertrand</strong>: Why don’t we drop this subject… it’s one
thing to engage in badinage with these youngsters, but this sort of
thing could be so easily misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: I didn’t think much about it at the time.
Just bullshit, y’know, everybody likes to make themselves out to be
something more than they are. Specially in the homosexual underworld.
But then when they got him I got real scared, y’know. Real scared. And
that’s when I got popped.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Willie, are you willing to repeat your
statements under sodium pentothal? Under the supervision of a
doctor?</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Fuck, yeah! I told you so. And you can
tell’em all I told you so.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You realize the things you’re saying, Willie,
are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their
college degrees in here! I got nuthin’ to hide. They can’t buy me. You
can’t buy me. I don’t even need the parole. This is about the truth
coming out. You’re a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don’t know shit,
cause you never been fucked in the ass. Fascism is here now, Facism
is…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No one’s trying to buy you, Willie. It’s
important to know why you’re telling us this.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: You wanna know why? ‘Cause that mother
fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin’ election, that’s why! Nixon was gonna
be one of the great Presidents ‘til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin’
country. Got niggers all over the fuckin’ place asking for their rights,
where do you think we got all this fuckin’ crime now, ‘cause Kennedy
promised ’em too damned much. Revolution comin’. Fascism’s coming back.
I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day
for this country. I jes’ hate to think they’re blaming it on some silly
fuckin’ Oswald who didn’t know shit anyway. People should know why that
sumbitch was killed. ’Cause he was a Communist. Put me on the stand, go
ahead, I’ll tell the same goddamn story, I’m proud of it, don’t matter
fuck all to me, things don’t change.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Your hunch was right, boss, but it’s even
spookier than we thought. Starting in September ’63 on, two months
before the assassination, there are sightings of Oswald all over Dallas,
buying ammunition, getting a telescopic sight fixed, going to rifle
ranges… Early November, a Dallas downtown Lincoln- Mercury dealership
where he tells the salesman Albert Bogard…</p>
<p>****: Hey, I got a lotta money coming in the next two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: …despite the fact he has no license and from
what marina says, does not know how to drive, he hits the curves like
Mario Andretti at the Indy 500. Bogard later told his boss he drove
“like a madman.”</p>
<p><strong>bogard</strong>: Three hundred bucks down, Mr. Oswald, you
can drive outta here with it.</p>
<p><strong>“oswald”</strong>: Who you kidding! For this heap? Forget it…
No honest working man can afford a car anymore in the goddamn country!
Maybe I’ll have to go back to Russia to buy a car…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: … really dumb dialogue like he’s trying to
draw attention to himself. A real moron. He walks out. The salesman
remembers him as about 5’7”, but we know from his draft card he was
about 5’11”…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …several witnesses see him on several separate
days at different firing ranges.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …one time, November 9, he decides he needs to
practice on the target of the guy next to him. Says something really
dumb to the guy, who says Oswald was a great shot.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, watcha doing, boy… that’s my target.</p>
<p><strong>“oswald”</strong>: Hey, sorry, buddy. I just thought it was
that sonofabitch Kennedy, y’know. I couldn’t help myself.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …about as subtle as a cockroach crawling across
a white rug.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’ll go you one better, Lou. He shows up at
Silvia Odio’s, a Cuban lady in Dallas working in the anti- Castro
underground - remember that name, a solid witness. The two Cubans
introduce him as “Leon Oswald”.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: …the Cubans want Silvia, whose parents are
political prisoners in Cuba, to help them raise money to assassinate
Castro. Something about the men bothers her. She tells them she doesn’t
want anything to do with violence… about 48 hours later one of the
Cubans calls her back…</p>
<p><strong>the bull</strong>: This guy Leon Oswald’s great, he’s kinda
nut… he told us we don’t any guts, us Cubans, cause Kennedy should’ve
been whacked after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should’ve done that,
it’s easy to do, he says - you know he’s a Marine, an expert
shooter…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: It’s like he’s giving her information she
doesn’t even ask for. She’s scared, doesn’t see them again till she sees
Oswald’s picture in the paper. But the Warren Commission says she has
bad eyesight because they have Oswald in Mexico at this time, trying to
get back into Cuba. The Cubans think he’s a double agent so they won’t
take him. The CIA has a camera outside the Cuban Embassy and says this
is Oswald in Mexico. You figure it.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: If this is Oswald, it must be our third
Oswald.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The interesting thing is the extent to which
the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist. They got almost 150
pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture
doesn’t even match. I’m beginning to think the point of the Mexican
episode was to lay the blame at Castro’s door. If Oswald, or someone
purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed
the President, the American public once again would’ve screamed for a
Cuban invasion…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I even have doubts about this photo, boss. It
pretty much convicted Oswald in the public mind. Well, according to
Captain Fritz, Oswald told him during his interrogation the photo was
fake.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: That’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>fritz</strong>: It came from Janet William’s garage.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: Well, I never saw that picture. It is my
face, but my face has been super-imposed - the rest of the picture is
not me at all. I’ve done a lot of photographic work, and that picture
was made by someone else.</p>
<p><strong>fritz</strong>: So who the hell are you? Alex Hidell or
Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: Well, you’re the policeman, you work it
out.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Oswald, who worked for Jaggars-Chiles-
Stovall, did know spy photography pretty well. I took this picture to
two experts. Look at the way the shadows on the nose fall in a straight
line like it’s high noon. But the shadow here on the ground reads like
late afternoon or early morning. It’s not the same time. Also look at
the crop marks across the chin. It seems like his head is pasted on
somebody else’s body implicating him with this rifle and gun.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: And of the two newspapers in his hands, one
is Leninist, the other Trotskyite. Any genuine Socialist would know they
hate each other’s politics!</p>
<p><strong>mobster</strong>: Clay Bertrand? Sure I know him. He comes
around the Quarter.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who is he, Joe? I’ve been to every bar, no one
wants to talk.</p>
<p><strong>mobster</strong>: I told your uncle I never met a lawman who
wasn’t a punk. You too, Bill, even if you’re family. He’s a big shot
businessman. I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big
shots. A fag, you know. Goes by another name down here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s the other name?</p>
<p><strong>mobster</strong>: Shaw. Clay Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw? The guy who used
to run the International Trade Mart?</p>
<p><strong>mobster</strong>: Yeah, what’s the big mystery? Everybody
down here knows the guy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So why does he call himself Bertrand?</p>
<p><strong>mobster</strong>: Who gives a shit what he calls himself?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: …now it gets positively spooky. In January,
1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald
we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name “Oswald” to buy
trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba. The salesman never saw him
again, but guess who’s on the articles of incorporation of the Friends
of Democratic Cuba? Guy Banister. Banister has someone using the name
“Oswald” to buy the trucks. Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated
June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald’s passport and
identity.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Goddamn! They put Oswald together from Day One!
Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a
board. Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems. You got the
word “microdots” in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the
electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201
personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in
different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of
incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after
the assassination. Does the real Oswald know he’s been put together? Who
knows. It doesn’t matter, does it? He’s a low level spy, he doesn’t know
who he really works for…</p>
<p>****: Let’s call it a night. Anything new on Ruby?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Mobbed up all the way. Tight with the Dallas
cops. I’m digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know you do, Lou. I’m doing three more
lectures this month. You’re all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.
But this is one where if you don’t nail the other guy, you’re dead. How
did Jack Ruby dies so quick? Of what? Cancer, right? A history of Nazi
Germany, Lou. They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30’s.
We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis. Read this. Our
biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland. Close to where the
National Cancer Institute is located. Think about it. Think the
unthinkable - question everything.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Even my own wife, chief, Who’s wondering where
I am?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Even your own wife, Numa. Any of you want to
quit, do me a favor… put us out of our misery.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I fould Clay Bertrand.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Grab your socks and pull… Clay Bertrand is
Clay Shaw…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: No!… Shaw! Director of The Trade Mart? This
is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Pillar of the community by day, gay bars at
night.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Can you get some sworn statements?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s gonna be tough. Nobody’s talking.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think we should have him in for a little
talk.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Do you have any evidence against him, Jim? Clay
Shaw’s done so much for the city with all that restoration in the
Quarter. He’s well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be
careful, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’ll be off the record, honey. I’ll bring him
in on a Sunday. A quiet little chat between gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 10</strong>: In heavy fighting in Vietnam today,
seven more American soldiers died and 23 were wounded. The body count
for this week now stands at 67 Americans and 626 enemy soldiers killed
in action.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and
knees and hunt for Jasper’s Easter egg.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know I don’t like these tribal rituals,
Freckle Face. I’m interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 10</strong>: President Johnson, meanwhile at an
informal press conference, said he regretted that there is no end in
sight to the war in Vietnam, where 500,000 American troops are now
fighting. “We face more cost, more loss, and more agony.” In his
proposal to raise taxes, Johnson…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: But Jim, we’re going to Antoine’s with the kids
- like we do every year.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: But why in the Lord’s name would you do it in
the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Because when I scheduled it I didn’t realize it
was a holiday. You were there, why didn’t you say something?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Look at the calendar, for Christ’s sake. You
said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m sorry, but it’s important. Clay Shaw is
important. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You’re missing most of your life, Jim, and you
don’t even know it. The kids are missing out too. It’s not just you
making the sacrifice here, honey.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Look, I’ll rush and be there by two, I promise.
Go ahead without me.</p>
<p><strong>clay shaw</strong>: Mr. Garrison - what can I do for you on
Easter Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Shaw, to interrupt this holiday,
but I feel this is a conversation we might better have out of the
everyday bustle in this office…</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: I’m not sure I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well… in an investigation we’re conducting your
name has come up a number of times.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: I wouldn’t imagine where.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We recently talked to a number of men who claim
to know you. Are you acquainted with a David Logan?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No. Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A Perry Russo?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A Willie O’Keefe?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No, I don’t believe I know anyone by that
name.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mr. O’Keefe told us he met you at the
Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had
him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street. Do you recall
that?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Of course not. I don’t know this man.
Obviously then, I wouldn’t have him to dinner. Incidentally, I do not
live in an apartment. It’s an 1860’s house built by Gallier. I’ve
restored it faithfully. You know I am quite an advocate of
restoration.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Perhaps a few more details about the evening
will refresh your memory. Mr. O’Keefe told us dinner was served by a
uniformed waiter - a colored man. He particularly remembers that you sat
at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because
the table was so long. Does that bring back memories of Willie
O’Keefe?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Not at all. But on the other hand, I do have a
lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting
at one end while I sit at the other. That is precisely the point of a
long dining table. The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of
it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: It adds a taste of elegance for which I must
confess a weakness for now and then. I call him Smedley. His real name
is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth
during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering
“Frankie!” .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: After dinner you paid him to have sex with
you.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Pffft! Absolute nonsense. The Quarter is
filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young
hoodlums who’ll say and do anything. As you well know.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …in the course of that night, Mr. O’Keefe said
a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house… along with another young
man…</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: David Ferrie.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No. I have never known anyone by that name. Of
course never having met Mr. O’Keefe I could hardly have met
Mr. Ferrie…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …and that the four of you partied early into
the morning hours…</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: You’re mine, Mary. Go get the fucking tools
out, bitch. Now! I want some ass.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Come here, bitch. You want this? The only
way you get this is do what I say. I’m the man. Don’t ever forget it.
You want it? You want it? Fuck you and your rich friends. You’re nothing
but a rich whore! You’re my woman! Get the cat! Strip! Now, woman. I
want to see skin.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let me show you his picture.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No. I’m sure I’ve never met anyone of such a
bizarre appearance.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to
you?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Clay Bertrand? Clay Bertrand? I believe there
was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of
Commerce. Is that the man you had in mind?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, it was not. Do you know an attorney by the
name of Dean Andrews?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: One meets so many attorneys in my business.
No, I don’t believe I know Dean Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>snapper</strong>: I’m hungry! When’re we gonna eat!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: We’re going to start without him and he’ll be
here for dessert. Snapper, you put that back!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I want a Shirley Temple!</p>
<p><strong>snapper</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: When’s Daddy coming, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Soon. He’s real sorry he can’t start with us
but he’s promised to be here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Naturally. Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison,
that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: You really have me consorting with a cast of
sordid characters, don’t you, Mr. Garrison.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Please answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Of course not! Such a pity, that
assassination. In fact, I admired President Kennedy. A man with true
panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article
saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in
Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of
funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities. It says that
this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: I’m well aware of this asinine article. And I
am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It says that this company has heavily Fascist
ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de
Gaulle in 1960.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Nonsense. What next?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …and that this company is linked to the
Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their
arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans…</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Mr. Garrison, you’re reaching. I am an
international businessman. The Trade Mart which I founded is America’s
commercial pipeline to Latin America. I trade everywhere. I am accused,
as are all businessmen, of all things. I somehow go about my business,
make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in
this world.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent
with the Central Intelligence Agency?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: And if I was, Mr. Garrison… do you think I
would be here today… talking to somebody like you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, people like you don’t have to, I guess -
people like you walk between the raindrops.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: May I go? Regardless of what you may think of
me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ve spent half my life in the United States
military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you’re
the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to
kill his own president.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Now just a minute, sir! You’re way out of
line!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on, chief. I’m sorry, Mr. Shaw, it’s
getting late. That’s all the questions we have. Thank you for your
honesty and for coming in today.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: I enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen, and you,
Miss Cox. It was most pleasant. I wish to extend to each of you - and to
each of your families - my best wishes for a happy Easter.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: “One may smile and smile and be a villain.”
Goddammit! We got one of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Daddy! Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hi, Freckle Face.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Tough day.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: My sympathies.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Liz, I’m really sorry. The meeting went much
longer than expected.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: We waited for you… hours, Jim. You could have
telephoned, for God’s sake. It’s Easter! You promised, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know what to say except I’m sorry. I
just don’t have rabbits on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I think you care more about John Kennedy than
your family! All day long the kids are asking, “Where’s Daddy?” What am
I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know what to tell them. How ’bout the
truth - I’m doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country
where justice won’t be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in
history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: That sounds dandy, but it doesn’t replace a
father and a husband on Easter Day.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s going to get worse, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Congratulations, Boss - you’re page one!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: office reading the</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: And it ain’t pretty …“the AD has spent more
than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since
November, 1966.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: They went to the public records and got the
vouchers we requested for withdrawals.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Shaw must’ve gotten them on our tail.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Could be Ferrie, Martin, Andrews, any of
’em.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We didn’t talk to Ruby ’cause of them and
they’re on our asses for a measly $8,000!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They hunted down the news, it’s their business.
Getting angry doesn’t accomplish a damned thing, but this changes
everything. We either pull out now or we go through some heavy flack
together.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bear in mind, each of you, this may affect the
rest of your careers, your lives… …if any of you pull out, I assure you
I will bear no ill feelings towards that person and will reassign you to
regular duties.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There it is then. Thank you. It means very much
to me. I’m giving this office $6,000 from my National Guard savings so
we can continue. I will make speeches where I can to pick up additional
money. Some local businessmen are putting together a fund for us
and…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Mr. Garrison, what shall I tell them?
They’re piling up outside the door. They want a statement, the phones
are going crazier than bugs on a cake.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Neither confirm, deny, nor discuss, Sharon.
Goodbye, ladies, gentlemen, I’m going home where I can get a decent
day’s work done.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 11</strong>: Mr. Garrison’s own silence on the
subject has raised some interesting questions. With taxpayer money has
he uncovered some valuable new evidence or is he merely saving the
information which will gain for him exposure on a national level?
Mr. Garrison it seems, should have some explanation.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dave ferrie</strong>: Did your office plant that garbage in
the fucking paper?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: You know damn well who it is.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Dave?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Yeah, you got it. Since you’re the only
straight shooter in that fuckin’ office, I’d like an answer from you.
Did you plant it?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Dave, do you think we’re out of our minds? The
whole building’s been a zoo since that broke. We can’t get a thing done.
Reporters crawling everywhere. You think we want that?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Somebody planted that fucking story! And
somebody tipped off the press I’m one of Garrison’s fucking suspects. I
can’t go home. I’m out on the street. The maggots are everywhere! Do you
know what you’ve done to me? It’s all over the national news now. You
know what you’ve done to me?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Calm down, Dave, what?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: I’m a dead man! From here on, believe me,
I’m a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What are you talking about, Dave? You weren’t
mentioned in the story. Don’t jump to conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: You think your investigation’s been all that
secret? You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other
people.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What did they…</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: You still questioning any Cubans?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Dave, you know that’s where this road
leads.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: It leads farther than that.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Dave, just calm down. Meet me in the lobby of
the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes. I’ll have a suite reserved for you under
an assumed name.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: The Fontainbleau? 20 minutes?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah. Come on, Dave, come on our side. I
guarantee you the boss’ll protect you… Dave?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: …give me protection?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah! He’d kill for you Dave. He likes you.
Your mind.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: I got no place to sleep. I’ll meet you in 20
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: President Kennedy said on one occasion,
“Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind.” I
pray God that America will hear this before it’s too late, because today
we’re fighting a war I’m convinced is one of the most unjust wars that
has ever been fought in the history of the world.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No, he’s not here now. And he would not take
calls here if he were! So please call the office number. Thank you. Two
of them even had the gall to come to the door this afternoon, one all
the way from England.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did they live?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It’s not funny, Jim, I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t be. Nothing to be scared about, honey, I
been through four years of war - this is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: …sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee
liberties in Southeast Asia which they have not found in Southwest
Georgia or East Harlem. So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel
irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and
die for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same
school.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I haven’t, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nothing is going to happen to you. I won’t let
it.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Leave us ALONE for God’s sake! …Oh, it’s
Lou.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: I’m caught in the middle. They’re after me.
It’s almost over.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Listen, Dave, why don’t we order some room
service, have a bite, relax. I’ll stay as long as you want.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: I don’t know who to trust anymore. Yeah,
sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got
anything new in the investigation?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You mean about the Cubans getting trained north
of the lake?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Oh, you got that? Banister’s pet project.
Getting paid by the government to work against the government.
Beautiful. What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy. He had all those
files.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who was paying you, Dave?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: You think I was a getaway pilot for the
assassination, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know. Were you? Who you scared of,
Dave?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Everybody! The Agency. The Mob. The Cubans.
Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out. Here, in Dallas, Miami. Check
out a guy named Eladio del Valle. My paymaster when I flew missions into
Cuba - he’s somewhere in Miami. You’re on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Hold it! Hold it! I’m not cooperating with
anyone. There’s a death warrant for me, don’t you get it? Wait a minute.
You’re not bugged, are you?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Dave, I always play square. No bugs. I’d love
you to go on the record, but I”m in no hurry. Whenever you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: I don’t have much time. They don’t even need
bugs anymore. They got these fuckin’ satellite waves. They put a bug in
a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous,
between his eyes. He was one of those products of a crossbreading
experiment. A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.
You’d never believe half the shit the Agency does. I’m so fuckin’ tired.
Haven’t slept since that shit article came out. Why’d you guys have to
go and get me involved with this?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: That cocksuckin’ faggot! He’s got me by the
balls.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Photographs - compromising stuff. And he’ll
use ’em. The Agency plays for keeps… I knew Oswald. He was in my Civil
Air Patrol unit. I taught him everything. A “wanna be,” y’know, nobody
really liked him cause he was a snitch. I treated him good. He’d talk
about his kid, y’know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but…
He got a raw deal. The Agency fucked him. Just like they’re gonna fuck
me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let me get this straight, now. Clay Shaw is
blackmailing you?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Fuckin’ A. How do you think the Agency gets
people to do their bullshit? Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Room service.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in
Dallas, or was it an impersonator.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Same one. I didn’t know no impersonator.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did you take a good look at the TV when they
had Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Black, black - just give it to me. Shit. I’m
so exhausted. My neck is killing me. I’ve got cancer. Had it for years.
I been working with mice, y’know, trying to come up with a cure.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dave, can I just ask you this directly? Did you
ever work for the</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: You make it sound like some remote fuckin’
experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once
they got you, you’re in for life.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Shaw’s an “untouchable”, man - highest
clearance. Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What about Ruby?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Jack? Jack was a pimp. A bagman in Dallas
for the Mob. He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our
side. Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro. Then we
tried to whack him. Everybody’s flipping sides all the time. It’s fun
‘n’ games, man fun ‘n’ games.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What about the mob, Dave? How do they figure in
this?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: They’re Agency, too. Don’t you get it? CIA
and Mafia together. Trying to whack out the Beard. Mutual interests.
They been doing it for years. There’s more to this than you dream. FBI
fucking hates the CIA. Navy Intelligence got something to do with it
too. Check out “Alan Pope” in Miami. Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.
Colonel Roselli. The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at
Ruby’s club. I heard he shot his own partner. Got that? Check out the
rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt. He’s dirty. That’s all I know. But the
Agency always runs the show. Check out something called “Mongoose”
Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they’re in charge, but
who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun ‘n’ games man -
check out Southeast Asia - that’s the next big number - the heroin
trail. “Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Then who killed the President?</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Oh man, why don’t you stop. This is too
fuckin’ big for you! Who did Kennedy? It’s a mystery wrapped in a riddle
inside an enigma. Even the shooters don’t fuckin’ know! Don’t you get it
yet? I can’t be talking like this. They’re gonna kill me. I’m gonna die!
I don’t know what happened. All I wanted in the world was to be a
Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts,
pray, serve God. But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness. They
defrocked me. And then I started to lose everything.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Shit! Forgot to glue this fuckin’ rug today.
You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.
And then I lost that. That fuckin’ Clay Shaw. I hate the bastard. All I
got left is in his rotten, bloody hands. He tipped the newspapers - I
know it. That’s how the Agency works. They use people, chew them up,
spit ’em out. Now it’s my turn.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dave, it’s going to be okay. Just talk to us on
the record and we’ll protect you. I guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: They’ll get to you, too - they’ll destroy
you… They’re untouchable, man… I’m so fucking exhausted I can’t see
straight.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Get some rest, Dave, and you’ll feel better in
the morning. We’ll talk then.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie</strong>: Yeah, yeah. But leave me alone for awhile. I
got to make some calls.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Whatever you say, Dave. I’ll be home. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>french reporter</strong>: Paris Match. We are the largest
magazine in all of France.</p>
<p><strong>soviet reporter</strong>: My name is Bulgarinov. I am with
Literaturnaya Gazeta of Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>american reporter</strong>: Bill Turner. Ramparts.</p>
<p><strong>mailman</strong>: Coming through, out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You know who killed the President?
Mr. Garrison is busy but his assistant…</p>
<p><strong>bill broussard’s office</strong>: A man with the demeanor of
Julius Caesar walks into Bill’s office.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: Hail! Et tu, Brutus?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And you, too, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>jim garrison’s office</strong>: Numa joins Jim with a stack
of new mail.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Love a duck! It takes twenty minutes to get
into this office these days. Are we famous or what?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Notorious is more like it. “Jim Garrison is
right. There has been a conspiracy in New Orleans - but it’s a plot of
Garrison’s own making”… and this - “one of the D.A.’s investigators
offered an unwilling witness $3000 if only he would fill in the facts of
the alleged meeting to plot the death of the President”… How can they
write that? Where did they come up with this? … “A charlatan,”
“power-mad,” a “hulking</p>
<p><strong>d.a.”</strong>: “Morbid Frolic in New Orleans.”</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The crazies have taken over the asylum! It’s a
zoo out there.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Sensational garbage sells newspapers, Jim.
What else is new? Look at the thousands of letters you’re getting.
That’s where the heart of the country is. “Dear Mr. Garrison, God bless
you for having the courage to go after the murderers of President
Kennedy. Please don’t stop till they’re behind bars. I am a beautician
here in Hannibal, Missouri, and my husband is a janitor in the local
high school. We have four kids and not an extra lot of money but we
enclose a contribution to help with your work. We are praying for you.
God bless, Judith Hardy, Hannibal, Missouri.”</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: That’s what it’s about, boss. For every lousy
article in the press there’s a hundred of these.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s fine, Numa, but what about all the
people who aren’t writing letters. They’re sitting home reading all
these lies. I just heard NBC crew’s in town to do a “White Paper” - not
on the Kennedy killing, but on us. One of their top guys, Harry Stoner,
is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh Jesus, Stoner!… Why doesn’t he call me?</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: What do you want to do, Bill - fold up and
close the store? You sound like it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Look, this is bigger than all of us. We can’t
try a case in this atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Mr. Miller’s been waiting.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh! Send him in. Denver oilman wants to support
the investigation. Bill, I know what you’re thinking, but sometimes when
it makes no sense that’s exactly when you just gotta stick to it, head
down.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Welcome, Mr. Miller. Jim Garrison. Would you
care for some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison. Your coffee’s
almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I’m glad you could find time to see me. I
flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil
business up there.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I’ve done quite well in Denver,
Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the
means to back up what I say.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We can use all the support we can get. I think
these might interest you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They’ve been enlarged and show a lot of
detail…</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Splendid, love to see them.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Where were you? Europe, Pacific?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Germany.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: You were lucky. I spent three years in the
Pacific. I’ve never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding
companies. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I imagine because this is the Criminal District
Court Building This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing
behind the picket fence. We…</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I know about that shot. A terrible tragedy.
How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: If you must know, virtually nothing.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: How many men are working with you on
this?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Less than you would guess. Most days two to
three assistant D.A.’s. A handful of police investigators.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: That’s all you’ve had all this time?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I admire you, Mr. Garrison. How did you
manage to make your way into Guy Banister’s operation?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That was never in he newspapers,
Mr. Miller.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I’m going to be very frank with you. You’ve
done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources
available to you. But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot
of confusion. You’re not going to do this country any good, and you’re
not going to do yourself any good. You don’t belong here. On this Mickey
Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The job manages to keep me pretty busy.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Nonsense. You should be in a job where you
can make decisions that have impact, affect the world. Here you’re
trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I propose you accept an appointment to the
bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your
talent. Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily
such an appointment can be arranged?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And what would I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Stop your investigation… it was a
magnificent effort but it’s over and done with. The press is already on
your behind and that’s only the beginning, my boy, only the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How long do you think it would take me to be
appointed?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Well, ordinarily these things take a long
time. But in your case, with your record it can be expedited - easily. I
guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who are you, Mr. Miller? You see that helmet
over there? I picked that up at the Dachau concentration camp when we
liberated it in 1945. It was the most horrifying sight I’ve ever seen,
Mr. Miller. Pyramids of decaying, stinking bones and skin one on top of
the other. I don’t enjoy looking at that swastika every day, Mr. Miller,
but I keep it there to remind me of what can happen when a country turns
from free democratic principles to Fascism, when a few madmen turn human
beings into digits and millions sit in silence and do nothing about
it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mr. Miller, you and I have met under a great
misunderstanding. I haven’t the remotest interest in becoming a Federal
Judge. And nothing is going to keep me from going ahead with my
investigation of John Kennedy’s murder.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bill, Mr. Miller and I have finished our
conversation. Would you show him out?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Those bastards! That’s proof enough right there
of what we’re up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government,
Bill!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, they offered you the carrot, and you
turned it down… you know what’s coming next, don’t you, boss?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Boss, I tell you something or somebody is
putting tremendous heat on David Ferrie. If we sit on our behinds any
longer, I don’t think the guy’s going to hold on.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Look at this bullshit! He keeps changing what
he says. We can’t possibly call him to a Grand Jury.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Susie, watch the language, would you
please.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on
deteriorating, and we’ll end up getting more out of him when he finally
cracks. If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the
best shot we’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You don’t get it, guys - he can’t go down any
further. We got to protect him full time.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I have a plane to catch… going to Washington.
An interesting lead, says he’s closely connected to these events, but he
won’t come down here… I know what you’re going through with Ferrie, Lou.
We’ll talk tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m onto Ferrie’s Cuban paymaster, Eladio del
Valle, in Miami. I gotta get him in, boss. I need more men - I can’t
even pull the teams to watch Ferrie… This is our case!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You just need some sleep, Lou. It won’t look so
bad when…</p>
<p><strong>garrison’s main office</strong>: The staff comes out into the
office with Him, disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What the hell is…</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Williams found this in your office… We think
the conference room is also bugged. And maybe the phones. The whole
place needs debugging.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Bugging the District Attorney’s office of New
Orleans! It’s outrageous!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s urgent for you, Mr. Ivon.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got
to be more careful. All these new volunteers, any one of them could
be…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay, you handle it, Numa. I don’t have time
for this nonsense. We’ve obviously got the bastards worried now. I’m
going to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Dave Ferrie’s dead. The body was found at his
apartment two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This case is in our jurisdiction. I don’t want
anyone from a Federal agency in here without an explicit Federal court
order. You got that, Hank?</p>
<p><strong>newsman 10</strong>: Was Ferrie murdered, Mr. Garrison? Do
you have any leads?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’s it look like, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: I don’t see any violence, Jim. Heart
attack, maybe an aneurysm. Looks like natural causes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s addressed to no one and no signature. “To
leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect. I find nothing in it that
is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome.”</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.</p>
<p><strong>ferrie’s bedroom</strong>: Jim hands Lou the medicine
bottle.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Proloid?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I took it once for a low thyroid condition… It
raises the metabolism, Lou. Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of
person who had a low metabolism?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’d say the opposite - hypertension.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ferrie was the only one to express some kind of
remorse about this whole thing. I think it got him killed.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Boss, we just got bad news from Miami. They
found Ferrie’s Cuban friend - Eladio del Valle - this morning, hacked to
death with a machete in his car. He was tortured, shot in the heart at
point-blank range and his skull was split open with an axe…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Jesus - if that ain’t the Devil’s piss! Those
bastards!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Found another note, same thing, no name, no
signature. “When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer
will be possible. I offered you love. All I got in return in the end was
a kick in the teeth.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesus, they must’ve been hard pressed to come
up with that one.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from
hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: He’d die pretty quick, either a heart storm
or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Can you ascertain if there’s Proloid in his
system?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked
at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it’s
difficult to know. Whatcha thinkin’, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, it doesn’t make sense, Nick - he was
afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace,
but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: If it’s a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The fact is he’s gone, chief, and so’s our
case.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Not unless we go for Shaw now.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: With whose testimony? Willie O’Keefe? A male
prostitute. Jack Martini? A drunk? Vernon Bundy? A dope fiend. Shaw’s
got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association -
they’re not…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’m afraid I’m with Bill on this one. We
haven’t got the goods yet.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: We wait, Shaw’s gonna get whacked. Oswald,
Ruby, Ferrie, del Valle, Banister, Bowers… how many corpses you lawyers
gotta see to figure out what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All right, all right. Break it up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where you going, boss?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know, Bill, I just don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, where y’at, Frank? You’re wasting your
time here. Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI allowed.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s you I want to talk to, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Your boss got a serious problem, Bill. Real
serious. We know what’s been going on at your office</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, I guess you do.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ve got nothin’, Bill. I’m talking as a
friend now. You’re riding on the Titanic. Time to jump off before you
get destroyed along with Garrison.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Frank, I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who do you think fed him that information?
Garrison’s going down. We’re talking your career here, Bill, your life.
You’re a young guy… we know you’re working that Castro thing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes, you are. Look we know Oswald didn’t pull
that trigger. Castro did. But if that comes out, there’s gonna be a war,
boy - millions of people are gonna die. That’s a hell of a lot more
important than Jim Garrison. Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!
You’re too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up. If you got a brain in
that thick skull of yours, listen to me. Listen real hard.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Jim Garrison?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: I’m glad you came. I’m sorry about the
precautions.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, I just hope it was worth my while,
Mr…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: I could give you a false name, but I won’t. Just
call me X.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ve already been warned by the Agency,
Mr. Whoever. If this is another type of threat, I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: I’m not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I
assume if you’ve come this far, what I have to say interests you. But
I’m not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except
to say - you’re close, you’re closer than you think…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Everything I’m going to tell you is classified
top secret… I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars. I was one of those
secret guys in the Pentagon that supplies the military hardware - the
planes, bullets, rifles - for what we call “black operations” - “black
ops”, assassinations, coup d’etats, rigging elections, propoganda, psych
warfare and so forth. World War II - Rumania, Greece, Yugoslavia, I
helped take the Nazi intelligence apparatus out to help us fight the
Communists. Italy ’48 stealing elections, France ’49 breaking strikes -
we overthrew Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz in Guatemala, Mossadegh
in Iran. Vietnam in ’54, Indonesia ’58, Tibet ’59 we got the Dalai Lama
out - we were good, very good. Then we got into the Cuban thing. Not so
good. Set up all the bases for the invasion supposed to take place in
October ’62. Khrushchev sent the missiles to resist the invasion,
Kennedy refused to invade and we were standing out there with our dicks
in the wind. Lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison, you understand?
I’ll come to that later… I spent much of September ’63 working on the
Kennedy plan for getting all U.S. personnel out of Vietnam by the end of
’65. This plan was one of the strongest and most important papers issued
from the Kennedy White House. Our first 1,000 troops were ordered home
for Christmas. Tensions were high. In November ’63, one week after the
murder of Vietnamese President Diem in Saigon, and two weeks before the
assassination of our President…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …a strange thing happened. I was sent by my
superior officer, call him Y, to the South Pole as the military escort
for a group of international VIP’s. This trip had nothing to do with my
nine years of work in Special Operations. It was sort of a “paid
vacation”.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: It wasn’t until I was on my way back in New
Zealand that I read of the President’s murder. That was 2 in the
afternoon the next day New Zealand time, but already the papers had the
entire history of an unknown 24-year- old man, Oswald - a studio
picture, detailed biographical data, Russian information - and were
pretty sure of the fact he’d killed the President alone, although it
took them four more hours to charge him with the murder in Texas. It
felt as if, well, a cover story was being put out like we would in a
black op.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Anyway, after I came back I asked myself why was
I, the chief of special ops, selected to travel to the South Pole at
that time to do a job that any number of others could have done? One of
my routine duties if I had been in Washington would’ve been to arrange
for additional security in Texas. The Secret Service is relatively
small, and by custom the military will augment them. I checked it out
when I got back and sure enough, I found out someone had told the 112th
Military Intelligence Group at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston
to “stand down” that day, over the protests of the unit Commander, a
Colonel Reich…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Now this is significant, because it is standard
operating procedure, especially in a known hostile city like Dallas, to
supplement the Secret Service. Even if we had not allowed the bubbletop
to be removed from the limousine, we’d’ve put at least 100 to 200 agents
on the sidewalks, without question! There’d already been several
attempts on de Gaulle’s life in France. Only a month before in Dallas UN
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been spit on and hit. We’d have arrived
days ahead of time, studied the route, checked all the buildings… We
never would’ve allowed all those wide-open empty windows overlooking
Dealey… never… We would have had our own snipers covering the area. The
moment a window went up they’d have been on the radio. We would’ve been
watching the crowds - packages, rolled up newspapers, a coat over an
arm, never would have let a man open an umbrella along the way - Never
would’ve allowed that limousine to slow down to 10 miles per hour, much
less take that unusual curve at Houston and Elm. You would have felt an
Army presence in the streets that day, but none of this happened. It was
a violation of the most basic protection codes we have. And it is the
best indication of a massive plot in Dallas. Who could have best done
that? People in my business, Mr. Garrison. People like my superior
officer could’ve told Col. Reich, “Look - we have another unit coming
from so and so providing security. You’ll stand down.” That day, in
fact, there were some individual Army Intelligence people in Dallas and
I’m still trying to figure out who and why. But they weren’t protecting
the client. One of them, by the way, was caught in the Book Depository
after police sealed it off.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Army Intell had a “Harvey Lee Oswald” on file,
but all those files have been destroyed. Many strange things were
happening that day, and Lee Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with them.
We had the entire Cabinet on a trip to the Far East. We had a third of a
combat division returning from Germany in the air above the United
States at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the entire
telephone system went dead in Washington for a solid hour, and on the
plane back to Washington, word was radioed from the White House
Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson that one individual performed the
assassination. Does that sound like a bunch of coincidences to you,
Mr. Garrison? Not for one moment. The cabinet was out of the country to
get their perception out of the way. The troops were in the air for
possible riot control. The phones didn’t work to keep the wrong stories
from spreading if anything went wrong with the plan. Nothing was left to
chance. I bet you there were even backup teams and cars on the other
side of the underpass in the event that Kennedy got through wounded.
They would have moved in with vehicles like they did with de Gaulle. He
could not be allowed to escape alive.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: I never though things were the same after that.
Vietnam started for real. There was an air of, I don’t know,
make-believe in the Pentagon and the CIA. Those of us who’d been in
secret ops since the beginning knew the Warren Commission was fiction,
but there was something… deeper, uglier. And I knew Allen Dulles very
well. I briefed him many a time in his house. He was also General Y’s
benefactor. But for the life of me I still can’t figure out why Dulles
was appointed to investigate Kennedy’s death. The man who had fired him.
I got out in ’64. I retired from the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p><strong>jackie kennedy</strong>: I never realized Kennedy was so
dangerous to the establishment. Is that why?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: That’s the real question, isn’t it - “Why?” - the
“how” is just “scenery” for the suckers… Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, Mafia, it
keeps people guessing like a parlor game, but it prevents them from
asking the most important question - Why? Why was Kennedy killed? Who
benefitted? Who has the power to cover it up?… You know in ’61 right
after the Bay of Pigs - very few people know about this - I participated
in drawing up National Security Action Memos 55, 56, and 57. These are
crucial documents, classified top secret, but basically in them Kennedy
instructs General Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that from
here on forward…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: … the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be wholly
responsible for all covert paramilitary action in peacetime. This
basically ended the reign of the CIA - “splintered it”, as J.F.K.
promised he would, into a “thousand pieces”, - and now was ordering the
military to help. This was unprecedented. I can’t tell you the shock
waves this sent along the corridors of power in Washington. This and, of
course, firing Allen Dulles, Richard Bissell, and General Charles
Cabell, all of them sacred cows of Intell since World War II. You got
some very upset people here.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Kennedy’s directives were never really
implemented, because of bureaucratic resistance, but one of the results
was that the Cuban operation was turned over to my department as
“Operation Mongoose”, which meant that people like my superior officer,
General Y, took over the Cuban personnel that were being trained to
invade Cuba - and the bases like the training camp at Pontchartrain in
your home state that were closed down by Kennedy… and that’s how the
“black ops” people, people like General Y, ended up taking the rules of
covert warfare they’d used abroad and brought’em into this country. Now
they had the people, the equipment, bases and the motivation… check out
an old CIA man, Bill Harvey - ran something called “Executive Action”,
which carried out foreign assassinations. Harvey was also involved with
the fake defection program that got Oswald into Russia. Check out the
Cabell brothers. Interesting links to this case.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …don’t underestimate the budget cuts Kennedy
called for in March of ’63 either - close to 52 military installations
in 25 states, 21 overseas bases, you’re talking big money. You know how
many helicopters have been lost in Vietnam? About three thousand so far.
Who makes them? Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell? Bell was near bankruptcy
when the First National Bank of Boston approached the CIA about
developing the helicopter for Indochina usage. How ’bout the f-111
fighters? General Dynamics in Fort Worth. Who owns that? Find out the
defense budget since the war began. $75 going on a hundred billion …
$200 billion’ll be spent before it ends. In 1950 it was $13 billion. No
war, no money. Sometimes I think the organizing principle of any society
is for war. The authority of the state over it’s people resides in it’s
war powers. Even Eisenhower - military hero of WWII - warned us about
it: “beware the military - industrial complex”, he said. Kennedy wanted
to end the Cold War in his second term. He wanted to call of the moon
race in favor of cooperation with the Soviets. He signed a treaty with
the Soviets to ban nuclear testing, he refused to invade Cuba in ’62,
and he set out to withdraw from Vietnam. But that all ended on November
22, 1963.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Only four days after J.F.K. was shot, Lyndon
Johnson signed National Security Memo 273, which essentially reversed
Kennedy’s new withdrawal policy and gave the green light to the covert
operations against North Vietnam that provoked the Gulf of Tonkin
incident. In that document lay the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t… I can’t believe it. They killed him
because he wanted to change things. In our time - in our country?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is
power, nothing more. But don’t believe me. Don’t trust me. Do your own
work, your own thinking.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The size of this is… beyond me. Testify?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I’d be arrested
and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized… maybe worse. You, too. I
can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little
things… Keep digging. Y’know you’re the only person to ever bring a
trial in the murder of John Kennedy. That’s important - it’s
historic.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I haven’t yet. I don’t have much of a case.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: But you don’t have a choice anymore. You’ve
become a significant threat to the national security structure. They
would’ve killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead,
they’re gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many
circles in this town. You’re some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature
to many folks. Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a
case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta
hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come
forward and the government will crack. Remember, fundamentally people
are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, ’bubba. I hope
you get a break…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Mr. Shaw, you’re under arrest, charged with
conspiracy and entering into an agreement with other persons for the
specific purpose of committing the crime of murder of President John F.
Kennedy in violation of…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …we have a warrant to search the premises.</p>
<p><strong>inside shaw’s house</strong>: In the bedroom, Numa points out
to Jim the hooks screwed into the ceiling. Al pulls out five whips,
several lengths of chain, a black hood and matching black cape. Dried
blood is on one whip.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: It’s either a Mardi Gras outfit, or we got the
Marquis de Sade here, chief.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t care if he was doing it with giraffes
in the zoo, Numa, it’s none of our business. Let’s keep this side of it
quiet, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: When you’re in a war, boss, you use every weapon
you got.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Not one word. That’s an order.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Name? First, middle, last.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Clay Lavergne Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>officer habighorst</strong>: Address?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: 1313 Dauphine, New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>officer habighorst</strong>: Ever use any aliases?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Clay Bertrand.</p>
<p><strong>officer habighorst</strong>: Next of kin?</p>
<p><strong>newsman 12</strong>: Mr. Shaw - What do you have to say?</p>
<p><strong>attorney general</strong>: Yes, Mr. Shaw was included in our
investigation and there was no connection found at all between Shaw and
the President’s assassin.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: If Mr. Shaw had no connection to the
assassination, why did the FBI investigate him? And why, if they did, is
his name not mentioned once in the entire 26 volumes of the Warren
Report, even it if is to clear his name? I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff.</p>
<p><strong>chief justice</strong>: No, I don’t think so. Mr. Garrison
has presented absolutely nothing publicly to contradict our findings. As
yet I have not heard one fact to refute the Commission determination
that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I congratulate Mr. Shaw. Most witnesses have to
wait for trial before they’re allowed to produce sacred cows like the
Chief Justice of the land as a character witness, who is of course not
under oath and free from the laws of perjury.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 13</strong>: Mr. Garrison, if what you say is even
partly true in this case, you realize you are damaging the credibility
of our government, possibly destroying it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let me ask you… is a government worth
preserving when it lies to the people? It has become a dangerous
country, sir, when you can’t trust anyone anymore, when you can’t tell
the truth. I say let justice be done, though the heavens fall.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: In the sheriff’s report, Mrs. Mercer, it says
you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but
that…</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was
driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car
- a blue Valiant. I’ll never forget that day.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: …there was quite a bit of traffic and I was
stopped alongside a green pickup truck. It was very noticeable because
it was blocking traffic and it was parked with two wheels on the curb.
When I saw the gun, I thought - the Secret Service is not very
secret.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: The next morning, Saturday, I went to the
FBI office and the agents showed me photographs…</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: I picked out three pictures that looked
generally like the driver of the truck and then…</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: That’s the man.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Jack Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>second agent</strong>: What about these others? You said they
might be him.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: They look a little like him. But no, I’m
sure this is the man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You mean you identified him on Saturday, the
day before Ruby shot Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: That’s right. When I saw him on TV, I was
shocked. I said to my family, “that was the man I saw in the truck.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But you didn’t seem nearly so sure in your
statement to the Warren Commission.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: That’s what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You
see, they’ve been altered. My statements…</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: This says “Mercer could not identify any of
the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed
slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck.” That’s not true.
I recognized him and I told them so… They also said it was a dark green
air conditioning truck, which it was not. And here… …on the Dallas
Sheriff’s report. This is really strange. See that notarized signature
on the bottom of each page? That’s not my signature. And there never was
any notary present during any of my questioning. I guess that’s all…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it’s
difficult to accept this.</p>
<p><strong>mercer</strong>: I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just
not doing their job.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: I’m a Republican, Mr. Garrison, and I don’t
go in for this kind of government bashing, but I must tell you
something’s not right when they don’t even bother to call Julia in front
of the Warren Commission.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They didn’t call a lot of people, Mr. Mercer. I
think it’s safe to say the Warren Report is a work of fiction.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison about the Carousel
club.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Oh yes, I used to go over there a lot to
see Jack and especially my friend Jada who danced there. It was the real
swinging spot in town. Everybody came. Businessmen, politicians from
Austin, Lyndon Johnson’s friends… Dallas was a slow town back then. You
chewed toothpicks, played dominos, spit and dated policemen. But Jack’s
was exciting. There were always cops there. Jack liked ’em around, but
he used to throw the drunks out himself, ’cause he was kinda a violent-
tempered man… it seemed everybody in those days knew Jack was with the
Mob. The cops were “bad” back then - they’d shake you down for the money
in your pocket. They put a lotta people in the cemetery, especially
colored people.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Beverly, what about Lee?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Oh, yeah. One time I came in, Jack
introduces me to these two guys. He said, “Beverly, this is my friend
Lee…” and I didn’t catch the other guy’s name. He was a weird-looking
guy with those funny little eyebrows. The other guy, Lee, didn’t make
much of an impression either. He wasn’t good-looking or nuthin’, he
didn’t look like he had any money, and he was in a bad mood, so I didn’t
pay him much mind. Well, I might not remember a name, but I always
remember a face. When I saw him tow weeks later on the television, I
screamed, “Oh, my God - that’s him! That’s Jack’s friend!” I knew right
then it had something to do with the Mafia… Well, about a week later,
after she told the newspapers she’d met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada
disappears off the face of the Earth…</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Never knew what happened to her till Herman
offered to sell me her wardrobe. I said, “but Jada’s coming back,” and I
remember the way he smiled… and I knew she was never coming back.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Will you testify, Beverly?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I don’t think so, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I thought when we came here, we had an
agreement.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I just don’t want to become another
statistic like her. If they can kill the President, do you think they’re
gonna think twice about a two-bit showgirl like me?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: We could call you in, Beverly.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know the pressure you’re under, Beverly.
Don’t think I don’t. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: …yes, sir, right here on this spot. The shots
came from near that wooden fence over there, near the overpass.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I saw a man run from this spot and go behind
the Book Depository - 30 minutes later I gave this information to the
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: I made it very clear to the Warren people
one of the shots came from behind that picket fence. I heard the report
and saw the smoke come out about 6 or 8 feet above the ground, right out
from under those trees. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind…</p>
<p><strong>dodd</strong>: …we, all four of us, all railroad men,
standing here, seen about the same thing. The smoke came from behind the
hedge - and a motorcycle policeman dropped his cycle in the street and
run up the embankment…</p>
<p><strong>holland</strong>: …we came around here to look for tracks. It
rained that morning and we found a bunch of cigarette butts. Someone’d
been standing about here…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: This is a good spot, chief, for the head
shot.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: I was standing here next to my friend
Mary Mooman, who took the photograph when he was killed…</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: I jumped out in the street and yelled,
“Hey Mr. President, look over here, we wanna take your picture.” He
looked up and then shots rang out. Mary fell to the ground right away,
shouting, “Get down, they’re shooting, get down, they’re shooting.” I
knew it but I was moving to get closer to him. The driver had stopped -
I don’t know what was wrong with that driver. And then, out of the
corner of my eye, I saw this flash of light, in the bushes and that last
shot… just ripped his head off, I mean, blood, brains, just blew
everything…</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: I looked up and saw smoke from the Knoll.
And everything was frozen - seemed like people wasn’t even breathing,
like you’re looking at a picture - except this one guy. I saw this one
guy running from the Book Depository towards the railroad tracks. And
that was the same man I saw on TV two days later shooting Oswald. That
was Jack Ruby. No question about it.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: It was him I was chasing up the Grassy
Knoll, thinking our guys had shot back and maybe we got one of them. I
don’t know what I would have done if I had caught him, but I knew
something terrible had happened and somebody had to do something.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: I never did catch him. All I saw in that
parking area were railroad workers and Dallas’ finest.</p>
<p><strong>first agent</strong>: Secret Service, ma’am. You’re coming
with us.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: Oh no, I’m not. I don’t know you. We
gotta catch this shooter - don’t you realize?</p>
<p><strong>second agent</strong>: I said you’re coming with us. I want
the pictures in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: …he put a hurt on me but good.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: I don’t have any pictures! I have to go
back and find my friend Mary. Lemme alone!</p>
<p><strong>first agent</strong>: Hush! Just smile and keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: These new people never identified
themselves. They musta been watching the whole thing ’cause they knew
everything Mary and me had been doing that day. I guess I wasn’t too
hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: How many shots you say you heard?</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: Four to six.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That’s impossible. You heard echoes …echoes. We
have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository
and that’s all we’re willing to say.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: …which is strange ’cause this is less
than 20 minutes after the assassination.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.
He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We have that taken care of. You only heard
three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you
hear?</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: I was scared. It was all kinda queer, but
it sure felt like two and two was coming up three… and then they took
Mary’s five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they
returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated…
The only one we saved was in Mary’s camera. I didn’t want to go to
Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me… so the lawyer come
down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: He asked me why I thought I was in danger
and I said:</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: Well if they can kill the President, they
can certainly get me.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: That doesn’t make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have
the man that killed the President.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: No, you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: He kept trying to get me to change my
story about the shots. He was getting hot under the collar, and telling
the woman not to write when he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: Look, do you want the truth, or just what
you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: I want the truth.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: The truth is that I heard between four
and six shots. I’m not going to lie for you.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: …you heard echoes.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: No. I had guns all my life. I used to go
turtle shooting.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: I realize you’re under a great deal of
stress .. it’s clouded your judgement.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: So off the record, he starts talking
about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I
didn’t know it or something. He got angrier and angrier and then:</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Look, we can put you in a mental
institution. We can make you look crazier’n Marguerite Oswald, and
everybody knows how crazy she is.</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: I knew something was crooked as a dog’s
hind leg, ’cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that
involved and angry… sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as
published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to
finish.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Are you willing to testify, Mrs. Hill?</p>
<p><strong>jean hill</strong>: Damned right I would. Somebody’s got to
tell the truth around here ’cause the Government sure ain’t doing
it.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots in 5.6
seconds. Here. I’m Oswald. Time me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Time?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Between six and seven seconds.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: The key is the second and third shots came
right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to
recycle this thing. The other problem is there was a tree right there…
Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder
film.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Didn’t Hoover say something about that? The
leaves had fallen off in November?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: It was a Texas Live Oak, boss. It sheds it’s
leaves the first week of March. You try to hit a moving target at 88
yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the
world’s worst shoulder weapon. No way. The FBI tried two sets of tests
and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald’s performance. Not
one. And Oswald was at best a medium shot. The scope was defective on
it, too. I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me. The guy
couldn’t do the shooting. Nobody could. And they sold this lemon to the
American public.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The Zapruder film is the proof they didn’t
count on, Lou. We gotta get our hands on it.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on
it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?
There’s plenty of time - he’s out in the open - a frontal shot?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I asked myself the same thing. Common sense.
Even if you miss the first shot, if he accelerates you still got him for
a second shot. No… the only reason for waiting to get him on Elm is you
got him in a triangulated crossfire. You got him on a flat low
trajectory from the front at the fence there.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …you put a third team there - in that building,
on a low floor.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it’s a
turkey shoot.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How many men?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: One shooter. One spotter on a radio. Maybe
three teams. I’d say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious
people. Hunters… patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that’s
why there’s been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years…
“3-2-1… green!” Or else “Abort! Abort!”</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Main Street’s over there - the original parade
route on the way to the Trade Mart. Too far right? Impossible shot.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: So they changed the route to bring it this
way.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who do you think changed the parade route?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Beats me. City officials. Secret Service.
Dallas police. They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.
But they didn’t bother running through Dealey. They stopped right there,
said something like, “and afterwards there’s only the freeway,” and went
home.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know who the mayor was?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Earle Cabell. And guess who his brother is?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: General Charles Cabell. Deputy Director of the
CIA. Fired by Kennedy in ’61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved
back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a “traitor”. When he came to New
Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who
introduced him? Our friend Clay Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: The Warren Commission call him?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: His boss was the one on the Warren Commission
who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Allen Dulles?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Head of the CIA since ’53. Kennedy fired them
both. Cabell was his deputy for nine years. Talk about the fox
investigating the chicken coop. Now we’ll have to subpoena them,
Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: They’re gonna love you, chief.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou. Go
home. While we’re still a little behind. We got two people killed, maybe
more we never thought about.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You never got anyone killed, boss. Their
actions killed them years before. If we stopped now, it’d be even more
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Subpoena them, Lou - Dulles, the Cabells,
Time-Life… the whole damned lot of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: The U.S. Attorney in Washington “declines” to
serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard
Helms, or any FBI agent we named.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, what do you expect from a pig but a
grunt.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Without them, it’s going to be near impossible,
chief, to prove Shaw’s connection to the CIA. We got the same problem
with the governors. All of them. Reagan in California won’t give us
Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska
on Sandra Moffet.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What the hell is going on? Never before has an
extradition request from this office been refused.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: We haven’t tried to get Julia Anne Mercer
in?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, she could get hurt. If you believe what’s
happening to these other people.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: She’s the best damn witness we have!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I just don’t want to do it. What else?</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Hate mail here. Fan mail here. The bad news is
the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I expected that two months ago, and they’re
wasting their time… The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me
to resign after 18 years. Well, maybe that’s good news - it was never as
good as combat, but this is. Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah. They were seen together in Clinton in
early September. The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter
registration drive.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on
some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement. No one really
knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw ‘em. They stood
out like cottonballs. I got whites and blacks saw ’em, but last time I
checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got
the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw ’em talkin’ at the seawall near Lake
Pontchartrain. But it’s tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.
He’s…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You know you keep saying that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Keep saying what?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You’re not digging.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies
he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right? It proves he’s a liar. Keep on
it, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: This is interesting - are you ready for this?
Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination. It seems
Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly
to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: I want to see Special Agent Hosty.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’m sorry, he’s not in. Can someone
else help you?</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: Can I use a pen?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: He left a note. Hosty told a Dallas
newspaperman it was a warning to him to stop questioning Marina at their
home when Oswald was not present. She was not a citizen, so possibly he
was threatening to deport her back to Russia.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: But what the note really said no one knows
because his boss Shanklin told Hosty…</p>
<p><strong>shanklin</strong>: Oswald’s dead now. There’s no trial. Get
rid of it. I don’t even want this in the office. Get rid of it,
Hosty.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Hosty tore it up and flushed it down the
toilet. Waggoner Carr, the Attorney General of Texas, says he had
evidence from the Dallas Sheriff’s office that Oswald had been employed
as an undercover informant for the FBI at a salary of $200 a month,
beginning more than a year before the murder.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This is just speculation, people, but what if
the note was describing the assassination attempt on J.F.K.? Come on
guys, think - that’s the only reason to destroy it, because if it was
any kind of threat, like Hosty said, they would’ve kept it ’cause it
makes their case against the “angry lone nut” stronger! Remember the New
Orleans meeting with Agent Quigley the day he got busted?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …there again Quigley destroyed the notes of the
meeting. I think we can raise the possibility that Oswald not only was
an informant but that he may well have been the original source for the
telex we have dated November 17 warning of the Kennedy assassination in
Dallas on November 22.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in
the FBI office, gave me a copy of this. It went all over the country.
Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this
wasn’t even mentioned in the Warren Report! Read it, Al.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: “Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in
Dallas, Texas, November 22-23. Information received by the Bureau has
determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to
assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas,
etc, etc…”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …shortly after the assassination, Walter says,
the telex was removed from all the files in all cities, as an obvious
embarrassment to the Bureau. I believe Oswald was sending information
through Hosty…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I have a hunch that from the get go, Oswald had
infiltrated this group, probably Cubans or right-wing extremists. He was
at the Book Depository that day, told to be there by their handlers,
either to prevent the assassination or to take part in it. They coulda
told him anything, they were going to close they were going to fake an
attack on Kennedy to whip up public opinion against Russia or Cuba and
reverse his policies - it doesn’t really matter what they told him,
’cause he was under orders, he was a foot soldier.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: I can get you in and up there. This is a
shot out the southeast window of the sixth floor. That floor will be
unoccupied between noon and one.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: What about the elevator?</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: I can close it off. The only access is a
stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>bull</strong>: We get them in as an air-conditioning
unit.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: No. A floor refurbishing group. Got the van,
the uniforms…</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: …if we can get the motorcade to turn from
Main onto Houston, that’ll do the trick, ’cause it’ll slow down to make
the turn here. You can’t miss. He’s a dead duck.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t buy it, chief - why would the FBI
cover it up? You’re talking the whole FBI here. A telex that disappears
from every single FBI office in the country?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There’s a word - orders.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Or a cover up! Jesus, Bill, don’t you have
enough proof of the FBI’s complicity now?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe I have a little more respect for this
country’s institutions than you do, Susie. You tell me how the hell you
can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army
Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can’t even keep
a secret in this room between 12 people! We got leaks everywhere! We’re
going to trial here! What the hell do we really got? Oswald, Ruby,
Banister, Ferrie are dead. Shaw - maybe he’s an agent, I don’t know, but
as a covert operator in my book he’s wide open for blackmail ’cause of
his homosexuality.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Shaw’s our toehold, Bill. I don’t know exactly
what he is, where he fits, and I don’t care. I do know he’s lying
through his teeth and I’m not gonna let go of him!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So for those reasons, you’re going to trial
against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you’re gonna lose! We should be
investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello,
Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the
Government. Ruby’s all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up. Hoffa -
Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and
maybe the Government doesn’t want to open up a whole can o’worms there
because it used the Mob to get to Castro. Y’know, Castro being
assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q. Citizen. So they close the
book on J.F.K. It makes sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a
low level. Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the
protection for the President? Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and
get him back? Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police
to make a mess of the investigation? Could the Mob appoint the Warren
Commission to cover it up? Could the Mob wreck the autopsy? Could the
Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the
Mob used anything but .38’s for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn’t have
the guts or the power for something of this magnitude. Assassins need
payrolls, orders, times, schedules. This was a military-style ambush
from start to finish… a coup d’etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the
wings.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, now you’re saying Lyndon Johnson was
involved? The President of the United States?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1
billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay
for the military in Vietnam. That’s just for openers.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Boss, are you calling the President a
murderer?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: If I’m so far from the truth, why is the FBI
bugging our offices? Why are our witnesses being bought off and
murdered? Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and
subpoenas when we were never blocked before?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe ’cause there’s some rogue element in the
Government!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?
Y’ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Julius Caesar: “Brutus and Cassius, they too
are honorable men.” Who killed Caesar? Twenty, twenty-five Senators. All
it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon,
CIA…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This is Louisiana, chief. How the hell do you
know who your daddy is? ’Cause your momma told you so… You’re way out
there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain’t going along
on this one. Jim sighs, saddened. Bill was one of his best men.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Chief, I’ve had my doubts about Bill for a long
time. He’s fighting everything.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We need him back.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Bill wasted a goddamn month trying to prove that
mob boys like Barding and Jack Ruby played ball in right field with Hunt
Oil.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I don’t trust the guy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Gentlemen, I will not hear this. I value Bill
as much as anyone here. We all need to make room for someone else’s
ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and
I’m just plain dumb wrong.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I’ve seen him copying files, leaving here late
at night.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I just plain don’t trust him anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Maybe you didn’t hear what I said. I will not
tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Boss, then I’m afraid I can’t continue working
with Bill.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Well, if that’s what you want to call it. I
didn’t ever think it would come to this. I guess I am, boss.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I will not have any damned ultimatums put to
me, Lou. I’ll accept your resignation.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You sure got it. You’re one stubborn and stupid
sonofabitch D.A. and you’re making one hell of a mistake!</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Aren’t you being a little hard?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, I don’t think I am, Susie. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: My God! My God! What have they done! It’s
lynchin’ time!</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: I’ll get it. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Hello. Is this Jim Garrison’s
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Virginia or Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Virginia, you’re a lucky little girl.
Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest. Would you like to be in
a beauty contest?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: That sounds fun.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: I need some information from you then.
How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: And how tall are you?</p>
<p><strong>newsman 9</strong>: To repeat - 39-year-old Martin Luther
King, who preached non-violence and won the Nobel Peace Prize, was cut
down earlier today by a sniper’s bullets while standing on the porch of
the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was surrounded by his
closest aides. The police say they have no suspects at this time.
Mr. King…</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: And you get of from school at 3 every
day?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Do you walk home?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Who are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Okay, Virginia, that’s all I need to
know. I’ll call you again when it’s time for the beauty contest.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Who’s this?… Hello?… Hello?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Mama, I’m going to be in a beauty
contest!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: What did he ask you?</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Well, he asked me everything. He asked
me…</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Did you enter Virginia into a beauty
contest?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: A man just called. He asked her everything!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Honey, some crackpot. Martin Luther King was
killed in Memphis today!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Your daughter’s life was just threatened!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a
dozen times a day at the office.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Our home, Jim! A kidnapper, a murderer, who
knows!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart,
nothing is going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: How do you know? How do you even know what goes
on in this house anymore! You’re too busy making speeches, stirring up
every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Get a hold of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’m leaving. I’m taking the kids and I’m
leaving! I won’t stand it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Honey, come on. The government wants you to be
scared. They want everybody to be scared to speak out. They count on it.
But there’s nothing to be scared of.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You and your government! What’s the matter with
you? Don’t you have any feelings? Your daughter! What kind of man are
you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll take them up to my mother’s if it’ll make
you feel better. Spend a week. I’ll change the locks, the phone lines,
I’ll even get a bodyguard, all right? Elizabeth, get a hold of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing
mattered to you in this life more than your children. The other night
Jasper tried to show you a drawing. You didn’t even notice he was there.
He came to me bawling his little eyes out. Jim, he’s sensitive - he
needs more from you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I promise I’ll make more time for Jasper.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Is it such a chore? I don’t understand you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Damn it, if I say I’ll spend more time with
him, I’ll spend more time with him. I can’t fight you and the world too,
Liz.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’m not fighting you, Jim, I’m just trying to
reach you. You’ve changed.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Of course, I’ve changed! My eyes have opened,
and once they’re open, believe me, what used to look normal seems
insane! And now King. Don’t you think this has something to do with
that? Can’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I don’t want to see, goddammit! I’m tired. I’ve
had enough! They say you don’t have anything anyway! Everybody in town’s
talking. You’re ruining this man Shaw’s life! You’re attacking him
because he’s homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid “trial”! Did you
ever once stop and consider what he’s going through?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s not why I’m attacking him! You don’t
believe me - all this time you never believed me.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh, I don’t know anymore! I believe there was a
conspiracy, but not the government. I just want to raise our children
and live a normal life! I want my life back!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well so do I, goddammit! So do I! I had a life
too, y’know - I had a life, too. But you just can’t bury your head in
the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth! It’s not just about
you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your
TV and “I’m jes fine honey.” While our kids grow up into a shithole of
lies! Well, I’m not “fine” about that, I’m angry. My life is fucked,
Liz! And yours is, too! And if you don’t want to support me I can
understand that but don’t you go start making threats of taking the
children away.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You never talked to me this way before, Jim
Garrison. I’m not making any threats. I’m leaving you. I’m taking the
kids to my mother’s. I am - I am.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Go on then, get out! Go hide someplace. Join
the rest of them! They’ll tell you I’m crazy. You got plenty of
people’ll tell you Jim Garrison’s crazy. You won’t have a problem filing
your divorce papers on me …somebody’s got to try, goddammit,
somebody!</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Are we going away, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, it looks like it, Jasper.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: Because of Kennedy? Are the same people
gonna kill us, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, Jasper, nobody’s gonna kill us.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: Do you love us?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes, of course I do, honey.</p>
<p><strong>virginia</strong>: No. I mean like mommy loves us. She really
loves us.</p>
<p><strong>jasper</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with feeling a little
scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing. It
scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man. If you let yourself be
too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don’t you -
and then everybody gets scared.</p>
<p><strong>jasper/virginia</strong>: Stay with Mom, Daddy… please.</p>
<p><strong>sidekick</strong>: And now, Jerry, here’s Big Jim Garrison,
District Attorney of New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I
call you Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ve been called everything under the sun,
Jerry. Call me whatever you like.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: First we had your charge that the Cuban
exiles killed the President, then the Mob, then you said the oil
billionaires did it, then you said the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan
collaborated to do it, now your latest theory seems to be that the CIA
and the FBI and the Pentagon and the White House all combined in some
elaborate conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. Let me ask you, is there
anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who you think did not conspire to kill
the President?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How many hours do I have to answer that one?
Well let’s just say this, Jerry - I’ve stopped beating my wife. Or maybe
you should ask Lyndon Johnson. We know he has some answers.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: There have been a number of reports in
reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone
way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you’ve
intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit
perjury. What is your response?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Your faith in the veracity of the major media
is touching, Jerry. It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet
over. But seriously, Jerry, people aren’t interested in Jim Garrison -
they want the hard evidence! They want to know why he was killed and
what forces were opposed to…</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Some people would say you’re paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing
evidence?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Are they? Why would they?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I’d
better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: These arrests were photographed minutes after
the assassination, and were never shown to the American public. They
show…</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Pictures like this don’t show up on
television!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure they do. The camera can pick this up.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: No, it can’t!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: he’s about to be cut</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: We’ll be back after these messages.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Jim, bad news. Bill’s turned, boss. I think he’s
given everything we’ve got to the Feds.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: We studied the memos - there was nothing
there, chief, nothing! When we went to confront him, the landlady said
that sonofabitch just took off, left everything.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Something sure scared him.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bill doesn’t scare that easy. Somebody got to
his thinking. He was never that good a thinker.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 9</strong>: Much is at stake tonight in California.
Public opinion polls show Senator Robert Kennedy of New York leading
Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota. Their anti-Vietnam War message is
obviously striking a chord with the voters, and whoever wins tonight
will certainly emerge as the favorite over Vice-President Humphrey to
win the nomination in Chicago in August. That man now seems to be
Senator Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Sure sounds like he’s winning.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He’ll never make it. If he wins, they’ll kill
him. He wants to avenge his brother. He’ll stop that war. No, they’ll
kill him before they let him become President.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Boss, with Broussard they have everything. All
our witnesses, our strategy for the trial. We’d have to doublecheck all
his work, there could be false leads… we gotta rethink this trial.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t think so, Al. You remember the
Hemingway story, “The Old Man and the Sea”? The old fisherman manages to
catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of
the boat to get it back in. But by the time he reached shore, the fish
had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the
skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong>: Then what are we going through all this
trouble for?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s a means to an end. This war has two fronts
- in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a
conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another
25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we’re going to
strike the first blow.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: And if you’re wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I never doubted for a second that I was. Will
you come to the trial, Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I don’t think so, Jim…</p>
<p><strong>newsman 1</strong>: With 53% of the precincts reporting,
Senator Kennedy continues to hold a lead of 48% to 41% over Senator
McCarthy. CBS News has projected Senator Robert Kennedy the winner of
the crucial California primary.</p>
<p><strong>robert kennedy</strong>: …and that is what has been going on
within the United States over the last three years - the division, the
violence, the disenchantment, whether it’s between blacks and whites,
between poor and the more affluent, or between age groups or the war in
Vietnam - we can start to work together. We are a great country, an
unselfish country and a compassionate country. I intend to make that my
basis for running.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They killed him, honey.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He won… and they killed Robert Kennedy. They
shot him down.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Oh no! No! I can’t believe it. I can’t believe
it. Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You’re right, it hasn’t ended, has it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I wish I could’ve loved you more… I feel
sometimes like I didn’t ever.. love you or the children enough… I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>o’keefe</strong>: That’s Clay Bertrand. That’s the man I saw
at David Ferrie’s.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: That’s who you say you saw… a confessed
homosexual, convicted of solicitation, pandering… a man who has lied
about most everything, who…</p>
<p><strong>bundy</strong>: It was that man there, yessir. He was at the
Pontchartrain wall with the man who shot the President. I remember him
cause o’ his limp there.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: A heroin addict, injecting himself at the
wall, barely conscious…</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: …that was the man there. He dropped Oswald
off on the voter line. I remember ’cause they were the only white
strangers around that morning. That big, black Cadillac of his made me
think they might be FBI.</p>
<p><strong>town marshall</strong>: …said he was a representative of one
International Trade Mart in New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: …more than five years ago, for two minutes.
It’s fair to say you could be mistaken, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: …figment of my imagination… The cat’s
stewing me, the oyster’s shucking me I told him, you got the right at-at
but the wrong oh-oh… Bertrand is not Shaw, scout’s honor and you can
tell him I said so…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Objection, your Honor. This office has won a
conviction of perjury against Dean Andrews on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: Exception taken. That case is on appeal!</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie
and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in
New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing
Kennedy, is that not so?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Well, I wanted to make sure she’s the same
girl I sent.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: I see… and why are you experiencing this
paranoia?</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Well, you see, I’ve been subject to
hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in
Korea…</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: He was one of Broussard’s witnesses, chief. I’m
sorry. He was totally sane when we took his affidavit.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: But how does Dymond know what to ask? FUCK!
We’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: When someone tries to get your attention -
catch your eye - that’s a clue right off.</p>
<p><strong>garrison</strong>: Your Honor, I call police officer
Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand.</p>
<p><strong>judge haggerty</strong>: I’m going to have to ask the jury to
leave the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>garrison</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judge haggerty</strong>: I’m sorry, Jim, but the defendant
did not have his lawyer present when asked.</p>
<p><strong>habighorst</strong>: Any alias?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Clay Bertrand.</p>
<p><strong>garrison</strong>: Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it’s been
standard booking procedure to ask an alias. You know that. There’s no
constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for
routine questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge haggerty</strong>: I call’em as I see’em, Jim. I’m
ruling it inadmissible.</p>
<p><strong>garrison</strong>: That’s our case!</p>
<p><strong>judge haggerty</strong>: If that’s your case, you didn’t have
a case. I wouldn’t believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>garrison</strong>: I can’t believe you’re saying this in the
courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>judge haggerty</strong>: Well, I am saying it. Bring in the
jury.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: We’re filing for a writ to the appellate
court.</p>
<p><strong>judge haggerty</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: …Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No, I did not.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: …ever called Dean Andrews?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No, I did not.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: …and have you ever met David Ferrie?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No, I would not even know what he looked like
except for the pictures I’ve been shown.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: …did you ever use the alias Clay
Bertrand?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: No, I did not.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: Thank you… Mr. Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, a very great actor has just given us a
great performance, Your Honor, but we are nowhere closer to the truth.
Let it be noted, my office is charging Clay Shaw with outright perjury
on the fifteen answers he has given, not one word of this…</p>
<p><strong>judge haggerty</strong>: You’re out of order, Jim Boy, now
sit down. Strike those remarks!!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: To prove their was a conspiracy involving Clay
Shaw we must prove there was more than one man involved in the
assassination. To do that, we must look at the Zapruder film, which my
office has subpoenaed. The American public has not seen that film
because it has been kept locked in a vault in the Time-Life Building in
New York City for the last five years. There is a reason for that.
Watch.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A picture speaks a thousand words. Yet
sometimes the truth is too simple for some… The Warren Commission
thought they had an open and shut case: three bullets, one assassin -
but two things happened that made it the Zapruder the third wounded man,
Jim Tague, who was nicked by a fragment down by the Triple Underpass.
The time frame of 5.6 seconds established by the Zapruder film left no
possibility of a fourth shot from Oswald’s rifle, but the shot or
fragment that left a superficial wound on Tague’s cheek had to come from
a bullet that missed the car entirely. Now they had two bullets that
hit, and we know one of them was the fatal head shot. So a single bullet
remained to account for all seven wounds in Kennedy and Connally. But
rather than admit to a conspiracy or investigate further, the Commission
chose to endorse the theory put forth by an ambitious junior counsellor,
Arlen Specter. One of the grossest lies ever forced on the American
people, we’ve come to know it as the “magic bullet” theory.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The magic bullet enters the President’s back,
headed downward at an angle of 17 degrees. It then moves upward in order
to leave Kennedy’s body from the front of his neck - his neck wound
number two - where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns right and continues into
Connally’s body at the rear of his right armpit - wound number three.
Then, the bullet heads downward at an angle of 27 degrees, shattering
Connally’s fifth rib and leaving from the right side of his chest -
wounds four and five. The bullet continues downward and then enters
Connally’s right wrist - wound number six - shattering the radius bone.
It then enters his left thigh - wound number seven - from which it later
falls out and is found in almost “pristine” condition on a stretcher in
a corridor of Parkland Hospital. That’s some bullet. Anyone who’s been
in combat can tell you never in the history of gunfire has there been a
bullet like this. The Army Wound Ballistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal
fired some comparison bullets and not one of them looked anything like
this one. Take a look at CE 856, an identical bullet fired through the
wrist of a human cadaver - just one of the bones smashed by the magic
bullet. Yet the government says it can prove this with some fancy
physics in a nuclear laboratory. Of course they can. Theoretical physics
can prove an elephant can hang from a cliff with it’s tail tied to a
daisy, but use your eyes - your common sense - Seven wounds, skin, bone.
This single bullet explanation is the foundation of the Warren
Commission’s claim of a lone assassin. And once you conclude the magic
bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you have to conclude
there was a fourth shot and a second rifleman. And if there was a second
rifleman, there had to be a conspiracy, which we believe involved the
accused Clay Shaw. Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen of the jury, thought
they heard shots coming from the Grassy Knoll, which is to the right and
front of the President.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Key witnesses that day - Charles Brehm, a
combat vet, right behind Jean Hill and Mary Moorman, S.M. Holland and
Richard Dodd on the overpass, J.C. Price overlooking the whole Plaza,
Randolph Carr, a steelworker, who served in the Rangers in North Africa,
William Newman, father of two children who hit the deck on the north
side of Elm, Abraham Zapruder, James Simmons - each of these witnesses
has no doubt whatsoever one or more shots came from behind the picket
fence! Twenty six trained medical personnel at Parkland Hospital saw
with their own eyes the back of the President’s head blasted out.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Dr. Peters on the stand.</p>
<p><strong>peters</strong>: …a large 7 cm opening in the right
occipitoparietal area, a considerable portion of the brain was missing
there.</p>
<p><strong>mcclelland</strong>: …almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter of
the back of the head - this area here… …had been blasted out along with
the brain tissue there. The exit hole in the rear of his head was about
120 mm. across. There was also a large piece of skull attached to a flap
of skin in the right temporal area.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: Parkland Hospital Emergency Room on
that day in 1963. The doctors work on the President. The wounds on the
back of his head are evident but will change later in the autopsy. He is
placed in a bronze casket.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Not one of the civilian doctors who examined
the President at Parkland Hospital regarded his throat wound as anything
but a wound of entry. The doctors found no wounds of entry in the back
of the head. But the body was then illegally moved to Washington for the
autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the Secret Service team preparing to wheel
the casket out. The Dallas Medical Examiner, Dr. Rose, backed by a
justice of the peace, bars the way. A furious wrestling match
ensues.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Texas Law, sir, requires the
autopsy be done here. You’re not taking him with you!</p>
<p><strong>kenny o’donnell</strong>: Sonofabitch, you’re not telling me
what to do! Get the hell outta the way!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Because when a coup d’etat has occurred there’s
a big difference between an autopsy performed by civilian doctors and
one by military doctors working for the government.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: Love Field the same day. We see Air
Force One taking off and a photo of L.B.J. being sworn in.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The departure of Air Force One from Love Field
that Friday afternoon was not so much a takeoff as it was a getaway with
the newly sworn in President.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: Objection, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: On the plane, of course, Lee Harvey Oswald’s
guilt was announced by the White House Situation Room to the passengers
before any kind of investigation had started. The “lone nut” solution is
in place.</p>
<p><strong>dymond</strong>: Objection! Your Honor!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained. Mr. Garrison, would you please
bottle the acid.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the Bethesda autopsy room in 1963. The
room is crammed with military officers, Secret Service men and, at the
center, three intimidated doctors. Pictures are being taken as they
remove bullet fragments.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The three Bethesda Naval Hospital doctors
picked by the Military left something to be desired inasmuch as none of
them had experience with combat gunfire wounds. Through their autopsy we
have been able to justify eight wounds - three to Kennedy, five to
Connally - from just two bullets, one of these bullets the “magic
bullet”.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Jim in court with a series of drawings
indicating with arrows entry and exit wounds to Kennedy’s neck and head.
Dr. Finck is on the stand, erect, very precise, and irritated.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you
not to dissect the neck?</p>
<p><strong>finck</strong>: I was told that the family wanted examination
of the head.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: As a pathologist it was your obligation to
explore all possible causes of death, was it not?</p>
<p><strong>finck</strong>: I had the cause of death.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the
witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the
track of the bullet wound in the neck?</p>
<p><strong>finck</strong>: Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he
said…</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: Bethesda autopsy room.</p>
<p><strong>humes</strong>: Who’s in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>army general</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>finck</strong>: I don’t remember his name. You must
understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in
circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is
dead, you don’t look around too much to ask people for their names and
who they are.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this
Army general a qualified pathologist?</p>
<p><strong>finck</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But you took his orders. He was directing the
autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>finck</strong>: No, because there were others. There were
admirals.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There were admirals.</p>
<p><strong>finck</strong>: Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you
are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the
end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was
Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically
told not to discuss the case.</p>
<p><strong>kenney</strong>: Gentlemen, what you’ve seen in this room is
intensely private to the Kennedy family and it is not our business
to…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: the chief pathologist, Commander Humes, by his
own admission voluntarily burned his never released the President
Johnson ordered the blood soaked limousine filled with bullet holes and
clues to be immediately sent John Connally’s bloody suit right to the
when my office finally got a court order to examine President Kennedy’s
brain in the National Archives in the hopes of finding from what
direction the bullets came, we were told by the government the
President’s brain had disappeared!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So what really happened that day? Let’s just
for a moment speculate, shall we? We have the epileptic seizure around
12:15 P.M…. distracting the police, making it easier for the shooters to
move into their places. The epileptic later vanished, never checking
into the hospital. The A Team gets on the 6th floor of the Book
Depository…</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the Book Depository, 1963. A shooter
and two spotters dressed as working men move into the Oswald spot. One
spotter produces the Mannlicher-Carcano.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They were refurbishing the floors in the
Depository that week, which allowed unknown workmen in and out of the
building. The men move quickly into position just minutes before the
shooting.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The second spotter is probably calling all the
shots on a radio to the two other teams. He as the best overall view -
“the God spot”.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: B Team - one rifleman and one spotter with a
headset, with access to the building - moves into a low floor of the
Dal-Tex Building.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The third team, the C Team, moves in behind the
picket fence above the Grassy Knoll, where the shooter and the spotter
are first seen by the late Lee Bowers in the watchtower of the railyard.
They have the best position of all. Kennedy is close and on a flat low
trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Probably two to three more men are down in the
crowd on Elm… ten to twelve men… three teams, three shooters. The
triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and David Ferrie discussed two months
before. They’ve walked the Plaza, they know every inch. They’ve
calibrated their sights, practiced on moving targets. They’re ready.
It’s going to be a turkey shoot. Kennedy’s motorcade makes the turn from
Main onto Houston.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Six witnesses see two gunmen on the sixth floor
of the Depository moving around. Some of them think they’re policemen
with rifles.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: …probably a security agent.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor of
the Dallas County Jail, sees them.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: …quite a few of us saw them. Everybody was
hollering and yelling and that. We thought is was security guys…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …they don’t shoot him coming up Houston, which
is the easiest shot for a single shooter in the Book Depository, but
they wait till he gets to the killing zone between three rifles. Kennedy
makes the final turn from Houston onto Elm, slowing down to some 11
miles per hour.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,
taking their aim across their sights… waiting for the radio to say
“Green Green!” or “Abort Abort!”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The first shot rings out.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sounding like a backfire, it misses completely…
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving as he hears something. Connally turns
his head slightly to the right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Frame 193 - the second shot hits Kennedy in the
throat from the front. Frame 225 - the President emerging from the road
sign. He obviously has been hit, raising his arms to his throat.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the picket fence shooter hitting him from
the fence. We see Kennedy from the point of view of his telescopic
sight. In the Zapruder film, we see Kennedy clutch his throat.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Frame 232, the third shot - the President has
been hit in the back, drawing him downward and forward. Connally, you
will notice, shows no signs at all of being hit. He is visibly holding
his Stetson which is impossible if his wrist has been shattered.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the Dal-Tex shooter. We see Kennedy from his
point of view, and the Zapruder film in slow motion.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Connally’s turning now here. Frame 238… the
fourth shot misses Kennedy and takes Connally in the back. This is the
key shot that proves two rifles from the rear. This is 1.6 seconds after
the third shot, and we know no manual bolt action rifle can be recycled
in that time. Connally is hit, his mouth drops, he yells out, “My God,
they’re going to kill us all”… Here…</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the sixth floor shooter firing rapidly and
missing Kennedy but hitting Connally .</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …the umbrella man is signalling “He’s not dead.
Keep shooting.” James Tague down at the underpass is hit sometime now by
another shot that misses.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the umbrella man pumping his umbrella. The
Cuban is looking off. The man on the curb in the construction helmet is
looking not at J.F.K. but up at the Book Depository.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The car brakes. The fifth and fatal shot -
frame 313 - takes Kennedy in the head from the front…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This is the key shot. Watch it again. The
President going back to his left. Shot from the front and right. Totally
inconsistent with the shot from the Depository. Again - … back and two
the left. … back and to the left… back and to the left.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What happens then? Pandemonium. The shooters
quickly disassemble their various weapons, all except the Oswald
rifle.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: sixth floor spotter dumping the Mannlicher -
Carcano in a corner as he leaves… and then to the Dal-Tex spotter and
shooter, who break down the gun and move out… and then to the spotter
with the fence shooter, who quickly breaks down the weapon, throwing it
in the trunk of a car parked at the fence. He walks away. The fence
shooter, dressed as a policeman, blends with the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the umbrella man and the Cuban sitting
quietly together on the north side of the curb of Elm Street.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: stunned, confused, people in the crowd -
some lying on the ground, some running for the Grassy Knoll.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Patrolman Joe Smith rushed into the parking lot
behind the fence. He smelled gunpowder.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the picket fence area where, with his
gun drawn, Smith rushes across to a man standing by a car who reacts
quickly, producing credentials. He is one of the hoboes. There’s a
strange moment when the camera moves from Smith’s eyes to the man’s
fingernails.</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: …the character produces credentials from his
pocket which showed him to be Secret Service. So I accepted that and let
him go and continued our search. But I regretted it, ’cause this guy
looked like an auto mechanic. He had on a sports shirt and pants, but he
had dirty fingernails. Afterwards it didn’t ring true, but at the time
we were so pressed for time.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yet all Secret Servicemen in Dallas that day
are accounted for. None were on foot in Dealey Plaza before or after the
shooting, till Dallas Secret Service Chief Forrest Sorrels returned at
12:55.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What else was going on in Dealey Plaza that
day? At least 12 other individuals were taken into custody by Dallas
police. No records of their arrests. Men acting like hoboes were being
pulled off trains, marched through Dealey Plaza, photographed, and yet
there is no records of their arrests.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the three hoboes being arrested …
marching across Dealey Plaza. The hoboes look familiar now.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Men identifying themselves as Secret Service
Agents were all over the place. But who was impersonating them?</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: men in suits, ties, and hats moving
people out of the parking lot area … turning a policeman back.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the Cuban, putting away a radio, and
the umbrella man, who now rise and leave the area in opposite
directions.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And where was Lee Oswald? Probably in the
second floor snack room. Eddie Piper and William Shelly saw Oswald
eating lunch in the first floor lunch room around twelve. Around 12:15,
on her way out of the building to see the motorcade, secretary Carolyn
Arnold saw Oswald in the second floor snack room, where he said he went
for a Coke…</p>
<p><strong>carolyn arnold</strong>: He was sitting in one of the booths
on the right hand side of the room. He was alone as usual and appeared
to be having lunch. I did not speak to him but I recognized clearly. I
remember it was 12:15 or later. It coulda been 12:25, five minutes
before the assassination, I don’t exactly remember. I was pregnant and I
had a craving for a glass of water.</p>
<p>****: At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is supposedly eating his
chicken lunch on the sixth floor, at least until 12:15, maybe 12:20 … he
sees nobody.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Down on the street, Arnold Rowland was seeing
two men in the sixth floor windows… presumably after Bonnie Ray Williams
finished his lunch and left.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Kennedy was running five minutes late for his
appointment with death. He was due at 12:25. If Oswald was the assassin,
he was certainly pretty non-chalant about getting himself into position.
Later he told Dallas police he was standing in the second floor
snackroom. Probably told to wait there for a phone call by his handler.
The phones were in the adjacent and empty second floor offices, but the
call never came. A maximum 90 seconds after Kennedy is shot, patrolman
Marrion Baker runs into Oswald in that second story lunchroom.</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: Hey you! Do you know this man? Is he an
employee?</p>
<p><strong>truly</strong>: Yes he is. The President’s been shot!</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the sixth floor, where we see Oswald as the
shooter. After firing, he runs full speed for the stairs, stashing the
rifle on the other side of the loft. Our camera follows him roughly down
stairs - we hear the loud sound of his shoes banging on the hollow wood
- to the lunchroom, where Patrolman Baker and Superintendent Truly run
in. Then they start to repeat the same action as seen in the previous
scene.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …but what the Warren Report would have us
believe is that after firing 3 bolt action shots in 5.6 seconds, Oswald
then leaves three cartridges neatly side by side in the firing nest,
wipes the rifle clear of fingerprints, stashes the rifle on the other
side of the loft, sprints down five flights of stairs, past witnesses
Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles who never see him, and then shows up
cool and calm on the second floor in front of Patrolman Baker - all this
within a maximum 90 seconds of the shooting. Is he out of breath?
According to Baker, absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: the second floor. Oswald ambles past
Mrs. Reid, a secretary in the second floor office, on his way out, Coke
bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look… there’s a lingering
close - up on his face.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Assuming he is the sole assassin, Oswald is now
free to escape from the building. The longer he delays, the more chance
the building will be sealed by the police. Is he guilty? Does he walk
out the nearest staircase? No, he buys a Coke and at a slow pace,
spotted by Mrs. Reid in the second floor office, he strolls out the more
distant front exit, where the cops start to gather…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oddly, considering three shots are supposed to
have come from there, nobody seals the Depository for ten more minutes.
Oswald slips out, as do several other employees. Of course, when he
realized something had gone wrong and the President really had been
shot, he knew there was a problem. He may even have known he was the
patsy. An intuition maybe - the President killed in spite of his
warning. The phone call that never came. Perhaps fear now came to Lee
Oswald. He wasn’t going to stand around for roll call.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The story gets pretty confusing now - more
twists in it than a watersnake. Richard Carr says he saw four men take
off from the Book Depository in a Rambler that possibly belongs to Janet
Williams. Deputy Roger Craig says two men picked up Oswald in the same
Rambler a few minutes later. Other people say Oswald took a bus out of
there, and then because he was stuck in traffic, he hopped a cab to his
rooming house in Oak Cliff…</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: Oswald’s boarding house. Oswald enters
his room, passing Earlene Roberts, the heavyset white housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …we must assume he wanted to get back in touch
with his intell team, probably at a safehouse or at the Texas Theatre,
but how could he be sure? He didn’t know who to trust anymore…</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: My God, did you see that, Mr. Lee? A man
shot the President.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oswald returns to this rooming house around 1
P.M., half hour after the assassination, puts on his jacket, grabs his
.38 revolver, leaves at 1:04… Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper, says she
heard two beeps on a car horn and two uniformed cops pulled up to the
house while Oswald was in his room, like it was a signal or something…
Officer Tippit is shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a mile away. Though
no one actually saw him walking or jogging, the Government says Oswald
covered that distance. Incidentally, that walk, if he did it, is in a
straight line toward Jack Ruby’s house. Giving the government the
benefit of the doubt, Oswald would have had to jog a mile in six to
eleven minutes and commit the murder, then reverse direction and walk
3/5 of a mile to the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime before 1:30.
That’s some walking.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s also a useful conclusion. After all, why
else would Oswald kill Officer Tippit, unless he just shot the President
and feared arrest? Not one credible witness could identify Oswald as
Tippit’s killer.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Domingo Benavides, the closest witness to the
shooting, refused to identify Oswald as the killer and was never taken
to a lineup.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Acquilla Clemons saw the killer with another
man and says they went off in separate directions. Mrs. Clemons was
never taken to lineup or to the Warren Commission. Mr. Frank Wright, who
saw the killer run away, stated flatly that the killer was not Lee
Oswald. Oswald is found with a .38 revolver. Tippit is killed with a .38
automatic. At the scene of the crime Officer J.M. Poe marks the shells
with his initials to record the chain of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Policeman Poe marking the bullets.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Those initials are not on the three cartridge
cases which the Warren Commission presents to him.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oswald is next seen by shoe salesman Johnny
Brewer lurking along Jefferson Avenue. Oswald is scared. He begins to
realize the full implications of this thing. He goes into the Texas
Theatre, possibly his prearranged meeting point, but though he has $14
in his pocket, he does not buy the 75-cent ticket. Brewer has the
cashier call the police.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: 30 officers arriving at the theatre in a
fleet of patrol cars.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: In response to the cashier’s call, at least
thirty officers in a fleet of patrol cars descend on the movie theatre.
This has to be the most remarkable example of police intuition since the
Reichstag fire. I don’t buy it. They knew - someone knew - Oswald was
going to be there. In fact, as early as 12:44, only 14 minutes after the
assassination, the police radio put out a description matching Oswald’s
size and build. Brewer says the man was wearing a jacket, but the police
say the man who shot Tippit left his jacket behind. Butch Burroughs,
theatre manager, says Oswald bought some popcorn from him at the time of
the Tippit slaying. Burroughs and witness Bernard Haire also said there
was an Oswald look - alike taken from the theatre. Perhaps it was he who
sneaked into the theatre just after 1:30.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: In any case, Brewer helpfully leads the cops
into the theatre and from the stage points Oswald out…</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: This is it!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Kill the President, will you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The cops have their man! It was already been
decided - in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Kill him! Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dr. Best, Himmler’s right hand man in the
Gestapo, once said “as long as the police carries out the will of the
leadership, it is acting legally.” That mindset allowed for 400
political murders in the Weimar Republic of 1923 - 32, where the courts
were controlled and the guilty acquitted. Oswald must’ve felt like Josef
K in Kafka’s “The Trial”. He was never told the reason of his arrest, he
does not know the unseen forces ranging against him, he cries out his
outrage in the police lineup just like Josef K excoriates the judge for
not being told the charges against him. But the state is deaf. The
quarry is caught. By the time he is brought from the theatre, a large
crowd is waiting to scream at him. By the time he reaches police
headquarters, he is booked for murdering Tippit…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No legal counsel is provided. No record made of
the long questioning.</p>
<p><strong>high official voice</strong>: Howdy there, Cap’n. Thanks for
taking care of us down in Dallas. Lady Bird and I will always be
grateful.</p>
<p><strong>fritz</strong>: Thank you, Mr. President. We’re doing our
best.</p>
<p><strong>high official voice</strong>: Cap’n, I know you’re working
like a hound dog down there to get this mess wrapped up, but I gotta
tell you there’s too much confusion coming out of Dallas now. The TVs
and the papers are full of rumour ‘bout conspiracies. Two gunmen, two
rifles, the Russkies done it, the Cubans done it, that kinda loose talk,
it’s carin’ the shit outta people, bubba’. This thing could lead us into
a war that could cost 40 million lives. We got to show’em we got this
thing under control. No question, no doubts, for the good of our
country… you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>fritz</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>high official voice</strong>: Cap’n, you got your man, the
investigation’s over, that’s what people want to hear.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: Now everyone will know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: By the time the sun rose the next morning, he
is booked for murdering the President. The whole country - fueled by the
media - assumes he’s guilty.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Under the guise of a patriotic nightclub owner
out to spare Jackie Kennedy from having to testify at a trial, Jack Ruby
is shown into the underground garage by one of his inside men on the
Dallas Police Force, and when he’s ready Oswald is brought out like a
sacrificial lamb and nicely disposed of as an enemy of the people. By
early Sunday afternoon, the autopsy has been completed on him. Who
grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald? Buried in a cheap grave under the name
“Oswald”? No one.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Within minutes false statements and press leaks
about Lee Oswald circulate the globe.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to x</strong>: reading about it in the New Zealand
Airport, and then back to the courtroom in 1969.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The Official Legend is created and the media
takes it from there. The glitter of official lies and the epic splendor
of the thought-numbing funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye and confound
the understanding. Hitler always said “the bigger the lie, the more
people will believe it.” Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely man who wanted
attention and got it by killing a President, was only the first in a
long line of patsies. In later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther
King, men whose commitment to change and to peace would make them
dangerous to men who are committed to war, would follow, also killed by
such “lonely, crazed men,” who remove our guilt by making murder a
meaningless act of a loner. We have all become Hamlets in our country -
children of a slain father - leader whose killers still possess the
throne. The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder
at the heart of the American dream. He forces on us the appalling
questions: Of what is our Constitution made? What is our citizenship,
and more, our lives worth? What is the future of a democracy where a
President can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious
circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles? How
many political murders, disguised as heart attacks, cancer, suicides,
airplane and car crashes, drug overdoses will occur before they are
exposed for what they are?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: “Treason doth never prosper,” wrote an English
poet, “What’s the reason? For if it prosper, none dare call it treason.”
The generals who sent Dreyfus to Devils Island were among the most
honorable men in France, the men who killed Caesar were among the most
honorable men in Rome. And the men who killed Kennedy, no doubt, were
honorable men. I believe we have reached a time in our country, similar
to what life must’ve been like under Hitler in the 30’s, except we don’t
realize it because Fascism in our country takes the benign disguise of
liberal democracy. There won’t be such familiar signs as swastikas. We
won’t build Dachaus and Auschwitzes. We’re not going to wake up one
morning and suddenly find ourselves in gray uniforms goose - stepping
off to work … “Fascism will come,” Huey Long once said. “in the name of
anti-fascism” - it will come in the name of your security - they call it
“National Security,” it will come with the mass media manipulating a
clever concentration camp of the mind. The super state will provide you
tranquility above the truth, the super state will make you believe you
are living in the best of all possible worlds, and in order to do so
will rewrite history as it sees fit. George Orwell’s Ministry of Truth
warned us, “Who controls the past, controls the future.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The American people have yet to see the
Zapruder film. Why? The American people have yet to see the real
photographs and X - rays of the autopsy. Why? There are hundreds of
documents that could help prove this conspiracy. Why have they been
withheld or burned by the Government? Each time my office or you the
people have asked those questions, demanded crucial evidence, the answer
from on high has been “national security.” What kind of “national
security” do we have when we have been robbed of our leaders? Who
determines our “national security”? What “national security” permits the
removal of fundamental power from the hands of the American people and
validates the ascendancy of invisible government in the United States?
That kind of “national security,” gentlemen of the jury, is when it
smells like it, feels like it, and looks like it, you call it what it is
- it’s Fascism! I submit to you that what took place on November 22,
1963 was a coup d’etat. Its most direct and tragic result was a reversal
of President Kennedy’s commitment to withdraw from Vietnam. War is the
biggest business in America worth $80 billion a year. The President was
murdered by a conspiracy planned in advance at the highest levels of the
United States government and carried out by fanatical and disciplined
Cold Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA’s covert operations apparatus -
among them Clay Shaw here before you. It was a public execution and it
was covered up by like - minded individuals in the Dallas Police
Department, the Secret Service, the FBI, and the White House - all the
way up to and including J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I
consider accomplices after the fact.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There is a very simple way to determine if I am
being paranoid here. Let’s ask the two men who have profited the most
from the assassination - your former President Lyndon Baines Johnson and
your new President, Richard Nixon - to release 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby, or the secret CIA memo on
Oswald’s activities in Russia that was “destroyed” while being
photocopied. All these documents are yours - the people’s property - you
pay for it, but because the government considers you children who might
be too disturbed to face this reality, because you might lynch those
involved, you cannot see these documents for another 75 years. I’m in my
40’s, so I’ll have shuffled off this mortal coil by then, but I’m
already telling my 8 year - old son to keep himself physically fit so
that one glorious September morning in 2038 he can walk into the
National Archives and find out what the CIA and the FBI knew. They may
even push it back then. It may become a generational affair, with
questions passed down from father to son, mother to daughter, in the
manner of the ancient runic bards. Someday somewhere, someone might find
out the damned Truth. Or we might just build ourselves a new Government
like the Declaration of Independence says we should do when the old one
ain’t working - maybe a little farther out West.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: An American naturalist wrote, “a patriot must
always be ready to defend his country against its government.” Well, I’d
hate to be in your shoes today. You have a lot to think about. Going
back to when we were children, I think most of us in this courtroom
thought that justice came into being automatically, that virtue was its
own reward, that good would triumph over evil. But as we get older we
know that this just isn’t true. “The frontier is where a man faces a
fact.” Individual human beings have to create justice and this is not
easy because truth often presents a threat to power and we have to fight
power often at great risk to ourselves. People like Julia Ann Mercer,
S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers, Jean Hill, and Willie O’Keefe have come
forward and taken that risk. I have here some $8000 in these letters
sent to my office from all over the country - quarters, dimes, dollar
bills from housewives, plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, invalids …
These are the people who cannot afford to send money but do, these are
the ones who drive the cabs, who nurse in the hospitals, who see their
kids go to Vietnam. Why? Because they care, because they want to know
the truth - because they want their country back, because it belongs to
us the people as long as the people got the guts to fight for what they
believe in! The truth is the most important value we have because if the
truth does not endure, if the Government murders truth, if you cannot
respect the hearts of these people… …then this is no longer the country
in which we were born in and this is not the country I want to die in…
And this was never more true than for John F. Kennedy whose murder was
probably the most terrible moment in the history of our country. You the
people, you the jury system, in sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw,
represent the hope of humanity against Government power. In discharging
your duty, in bringing the first conviction in this house of cards
against Clay Shaw, “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what
you can do for your country.” Do not forget your young President who
forfeited his life. Show the world this is still a government of the
people, for the people, and by the people. Nothing as long as you live
will ever be more important. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: later in the same courtroom. The jury files
in, having reached a verdict. Jim, prepared, sits with his staff and
Liz. The jury foreman enters the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>jury foreman</strong>: We find Clay Shaw… not guilty on all
counts.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We believe there was a conspiracy, but
whether Clay Shaw was a part of it is another kettle of fish.</p>
<p><strong>english reporter</strong>: Mr. Garrison, the American media
is reporting this as a full vindication of the Warren Commission, do
you…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think all it proves is you cannot run a trial
even questioning the intelligence operations of the government in the
light of day.</p>
<p><strong>newsman 13</strong>: We understand that The Times - Picayune
will call for your resignation - unfit to hold office. You’ve ruined
Clay Shaw’s reputation - are you going to resign?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hell, no. I’m gonna run again. And I’m gonna
win. Thank you very much. If it takes me 30 years to nail every one of
the assassins, then I will continue this investigation for 30 years. I
owe that not only to Jack Kennedy, but to my country.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: You didn’t get that break you needed, but you
went as far as any man could, bubba. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just speculating, I guess. How do you think it
started?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big
oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were
committed to a war in Southeast Asia. As early as ’61 they knew Kennedy
was going to change things… He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.
Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New
York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany… who knows, it’s international now.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: a New York lunch club or executive dining
room. From the window we have a towering view of the City. Four men in
their 50’s to 70’s - old men, rich men, talk at a quiet table. Their
figures are shadowy and we overhear their conversation obliquely, across
faces flared out by sun bouncing off the skyscraper window.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: One worried sonofabitch with a few million
dollars turns to the others… with a few million dollars… and says
something pretty direct like…</p>
<p><strong>rich man 1</strong>: The sonofabitch is gonna get re- elected
by a bigger vote than ever in ’64. It’s gonna be worse than Roosevelt.
The country won’t survive as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>rich man 2</strong>: I agree, Bob, it can’t go on.</p>
<p><strong>rich man 3</strong>: …and Bobby in ’68? Something’s got to be
done.</p>
<p><strong>rich man 1</strong>: He’s gotta go, Lou. The election’s gotta
be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>rich man 1</strong>: I talk to a lot of people. I know I’m
not the only one thinking this.</p>
<p><strong>rich man 2</strong>: What’s the feeling in Washington,
Jack?</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the Pentagon in 1962.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …so calls are made. Down to Washington. All over
the world. They start talking about it. A few people here, there. Just
conversations, nothing more…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Generals, Admirals, CIA people, and probably some
people on the inside of Kennedy’s staff - young, brilliant Judases,
ready to go to war in Southeast Asia…</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the White House, 1962. A general talks
to one of Kennedy’s staff - a bespectacled, bright young Harvard
type.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …and maybe a Vice-President getting separate
memos from Vietnam, eager to get his backers the billions of dollars in
contracts for Southeast Asia…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Kennedy, like Caesar, is surrounded with enemies.
Something is underway but it has no face. Yet everyone in the loop
knows…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Money is at stake. Big money. A hundred billion.
The Kennedy brothers target voting districts for defense dollars. They
give TFX fighter contracts only to the counties that are going to make a
difference in ’64. These people fight back. Their way. One day another
call is made…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …maybe to somebody like my superior who’s been
running the “Mongoose” program out of Florida and who has no love for
Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Bill, we’re going. We need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Everything’s cellurized. No one has said “he must
die,” there’s been no vote, there’s nothing on paper, there’s no one to
blame. It’s as old as the Crucifixion: the Mafia firing squad, one
blank, no one’s guilty because everyone in the Power Structure who knows
anything has a plausible deniability. There are no compromising
connections except at the most secret point. But what’s paramount is
that it must succeed. No matter how many die, how much it costs, the
perpetrators must be on the winning side and never subject to
prosecution for anything by anyone. That is a coup d’etat.</p>
<p><strong>y</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: In the fall. Probably in the south.
We want you to come up with a plan…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: He’s done it before. Other countries. Lumumba in
the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he’s working on Castro. No
big deal. In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that
moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have
the mayor and the cops in their pocket. Y flies in the assassins, maybe
from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some
locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams. Does it really matter who
shot from what rooftop? Part of the scenery. The assassins by now are
dead or well paid and long gone…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Any chance of one of them confessing
someday?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …don’t think so. When they start to drool, they
get rid of ’em. These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey
Plaza! They took out the President of the United States! That’s
entertainment! And they served their country doing it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …and your General?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …got promoted to two stars, but he was never
military, you know, always CIA. Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility
when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to
him when I see him at the supermarket…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ever ask him?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: You never ask a spook a question. No point. He’ll
never give you a straight answer. General Y still thinks of himself of
the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept
of war more.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: His name?</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: Does it matter? Another technician. But an
interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza. You know how
I know? That picture of yours. The hoboes… you never looked deep
enough…</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: one of the hobo pictures. Next to the
freight entrance of the Book Depository, Y, in a dark suit, is
nonchalantly walking past the hoboes, his back to us. The camera closes
in on Y.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: I knew the man 20 years. That’s him. The way he
walked… arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted
left hand, the large class ring. What was he doing there? If anyone had
asked him, he’d probably say “protection” but I’ll tell you I think he
was giving some kind of “okay” signal to those hoboes - they’re about to
get booked and he’s telling ’em it’s gonna be okay, they’re covered. And
in fact they were - you never heard of them again.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …some story… the whole thing. It’s like it
never happened.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: It never did.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just think… just think. What happened to our
country .. to the world… because of that murder… Vietnam, racial
conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt,
assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier…</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th,
the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on
Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.</p>
<p><strong>flashback to</strong>: the White House, 1963. Johnson sits
across the shadowed room with Lodge and others. His Texas drawl rises
and falls. He signs something unseen.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Gentlemen, I want you to know I’m not going
to let Vietnam go the way China did. I’m personally committed. I’m not
going to take one soldier out of there ’til they know we mean business
in Asia… You just get me elected, and I’ll give you your damned war.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong>: …and that was the day Vietnam started.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Documentary footage of - U.S. Marines
arriving in full force on the beaches of Danang, March 8, 1965… as
another era begins and our movie ends.</p>
<p><strong>southeast asia</strong>: 58,000 American lives, 2 million
Asian lives, $220 billion spent, 10 million Americans air - lifted there
by commercial aircraft, more than 5,000 helicopters lost, 6.5 million
tons of bombs dropped.</p>
