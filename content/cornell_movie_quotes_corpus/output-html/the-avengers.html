<p><strong>emma</strong>: How now brown cow … The rain in Spain falls
mainly on the plain … The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Password affirmative. Thank you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ready, darling?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Ready as I’ll ever be …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna
ready… Thermal chamber ready … Compression module set … Temperature
control on course between one and one forty … Water turbulence steady
…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Good luck … Peter … Emma.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thanks, Valentine …</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just a minute, darling. My brother’s a worry
wart. I better have a word … Valentine –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Something to remember me by.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: See you in an hour …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: One sunny day …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Readings still normal …</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Losing control – malfunction in thermal
chamber – for Christ’s – Emm –!</p>
<p><strong>countdown</strong>: Five – four – three – two – one … Three –
two – one … Three – two – one …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Emma, Peter, get out! It’s going to
explode!</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Emma …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Get out! Leave him – ! Emma!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Peter!</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Don’t wait for him – he’s not –</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Emma … Emma …</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: … The War Office today approved military
expenditure for the nation’s new defense alert system. A spokesman said
he would raise the matter at the forthcoming World Council of Ministers,
but that a state of vigilance was still necessary in the uncertain
climate.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Brenda – ?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Steed – ?!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Mother. I thought you were burglars.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Brenda and I thought we’d drop in.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: See how you’re getting on …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Something in the wind?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Weather’s turning nasty.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You didn’t come to talk about the weather,
surely.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody. I
expect you’ll like her.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: ‘Her’?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Dr. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thank you …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: ‘Please answer the Telephone.’</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
Steed … Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John Steed …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Kippers …?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: May I help you, madam …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Mr. John Steed, please.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: I’m afraid that’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Impossible?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: You are female?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: As you see.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Then you can’t come in.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I have an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: No women. Not in Boodles. Not since
1922.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Really – what happened in 1922?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thank you so much. I can find Mr. Steed myself
…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Doctor Peel, I presume?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: And you must be Steed. Please don’t get
up.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I was about to throw in the towel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I had a spot of bother at the door.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I shouldn’t wonder. Not a woman inside
Boodles since –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: 1922. Why the kippers?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Red herring would have been too obvious,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: So what was all this – some sort of test?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Congratulations, you’ve penetrated a bastion
of male privilege. I guessed you weren’t a stickler for Tradition,
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Whereas you are.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone
who doesn’t play by the rules.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Rules are made to be broken.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the
game is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: And just what is the game?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go
an calling you Dr. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Under the circumstances, you may call me
Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Much better.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: And now that we’ve settled the matter of
honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I didn’t. Mother did.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Mother?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I expect you’ll like him.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Tea time – four o’clock. Mustn’t be late. A
word of warning. Don’t take the macaroon. Mother’s favorite.</p>
<p><strong>river thames water authority</strong>: No Admittance</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: That’s better. I much prefer a womb with
view, don’t you, Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Shall I be mother?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I expect you’re wondering where you are.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Don’t tell me: You’re the shadow secret
service. You’re so hushhush, even the legit secret service knows nothing
about it. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Close. We’re so hush-hush, even we know
nothing about it. Now let’s see, there’s coconut cake, date and walnut;
I recommend the rum baba …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Hmmm …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Looks like rain, Steed…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: … Showers followed by sunny periods.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: We’re not here to talk about the weather,
surely.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, yes we are.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Macaroon?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We’ve had a series of bizarre weather
reports. We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into the field for data.
Case number one: April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins
investigating mysterious fires in corn circles. A field outside the
village of Little Snoring, one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped
by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death in a giant ice cube – like a
mammoth in perma-frost. Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M.
Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, investigating
bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak rainstorm downed him. Knocked
unconscious by a flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five
inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size of a cricket
pitch … … Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief Major Courtnay.
Remains discovered in a turnip field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our
boffins recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, temperature of
1000 degrees. Spontaneous combustion. Not much of him left …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My number two. Special assignments. She’s
–</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Let me guess – ‘Father’?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You’re –</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: God, you’re quick.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Ah … From Trubshaw’s. My shoemaker.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they
investigating?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: A series of bizarre shifts in local weather
patterns …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Global warming?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English
village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in
summer?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: How curious …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Something strange is happening. And whoever
knows about it doesn’t want us to find out.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Your mission is simple. Find out how and why
these agents died.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m no spy – where do I fit in?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your research into climate engineering was
state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our
knowledge of global warming – had they succeeded. We need your
expertise.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Perhaps I’d better start calling you doctor
again, Mrs. Peel –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m not sure I’m ready to return to work. I’ve
been out of action for some time. I’ll consider your proposal.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: One moment, Mrs. Peel. There’s another
special reason we wanted you to join our happy family; rather curious,
actually …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.
One description tallied in all three places. Recognize her?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Me, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Think of it as special assignment,
Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You’re our chief suspect.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You’re saying I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Father will be your controller. Steed here
will show you the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Ropes?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Think she really killed those agents?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: She may not know. Theory goes she may be
very ill.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Amnesia?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Possibly. Split personality …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Insane … ?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you
should watch out.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: She may try to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. Darling.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
she’s obsessively devoted to the memory of her husband the scientist
Peter Peel. You may find her a little … remote.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: They were a team. Met at Cambridge.
Working on a top secret research mission into weather conditions, code
name The Prospero Project, when Peel died.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Something went wrong. System malfunction.
Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing
proven. File still open.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: How come you took so much interest in her,
Dr. Darling?</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Her husband was one of ours.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Peel? Did she know?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Still doesn’t. Better safe than sorry. She
was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.
If she is, there’s only one solution. Termination.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Anyone particular in mind?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You’re a lady of hidden talents, Mrs. Peel
…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ve no intention of hiding them …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Scientist … … marksman … … swordsman … … To
what do you attribute your overachievements?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: My father always wanted a boy.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Really? I fail to see the connection.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I had a feeling you would. Touche!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I take your point.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Yes indeed. I need protection.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I thought we were on our way.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw’s a man worth
meeting. No point setting out half shod.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Or half cocked.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I couldn’t agree more. Thank you,
Trubshaw.</p>
<p><strong>trubshaw</strong>: Very good, Mr. Steed.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Steed, we really must be –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made
shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You can but I wish you wouldn’t …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Thank you, Trubshaw …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: That place is so absurd, so out of date …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Do you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Press that button, would you? Tea?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Sorry. Didn’t mean to interrupt your flow of
oratory …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You know what I mean. This car – and you.
Nobody walks around like that. Milk?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But why? What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part
of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: And I suppose you’re the knight.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: The most unpredictable piece on the board.
And always ready to protect his queen.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: That’s predictable. When I find a queen in
need of protection I’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I’m hoping you will.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Sir August Merryweather … why are we seeing
him first?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: As per mother’s instructions.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Do we always follow Mother’s instructions?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: For a man in my position –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Just what is your position, if you don’t mind
my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of
work?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: They call me in when they’ve reached a dead
end. Freelance. Like yourself.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I have no choice. Why should you risk your
life?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: After our fencing match, I was rather hoping
you would do the risking. More tea?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I meant me.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: According to Mother, Sir August owns half of
the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the
Ministry. Now …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: An eccentric recluse?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He
has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere – Julie.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: June, July … August?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: The family does seem to be somewhat
meteorologically inclined.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Any other vices?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: All of a piece, really. A fanatical
weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY. British Royal Organisation For Lasting
Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by …
aliens.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: So … I distract him while you snoop around?
How?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Small talk. Try the weather.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Original …</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: This way, miss …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Missus …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Sir August … ? Sir August … ?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Eh? In here!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ve come to apply for membership in Brolly
–</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: You don’t get rain like you used to in
England. A good shower that’s the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the
spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for
it?</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: Out in India. So character-forming for
the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good
monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I
remember one summer in Jaipur …</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: You</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: You mean you don’t recall??</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: Ah, Lady June …</p>
<p><strong>lady june</strong>: Dear August. Loves his showers. Like a
baby. Scones, Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thank you, Lady – June …</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Promised? Who promised?</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: There, look!</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: Imagine being caught out in a blow like
that!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I say, this is a bit much.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: ‘The Merry Widow’…?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … Hello … Hello? … Who the hell…? Who is
this? … You must leave the test area. I repeat, leave the area … Help is
on the way …</p>
<p><strong>.steed</strong>: Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by. And I see
you’re wearing your - riding outfit?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Manners, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Ah, Brenda … Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You should be dead. How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Strange.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You were very lucky. Four shots to the heart.
I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you
here. Not me you should thank.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I wasn’t about to.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof
waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I might say the same.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Mother and Dr. Darling have me under
observation. They think I tried to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Why should they think that?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You told them. You said I arrived on a camel,
shot you four times. Left you for dead.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Frankly that’s how I remember it.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But that’s absurd. I may not be over-fond of
you, Steed, but it’s not my style.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: That’s possible. Sir August was convinced he’d
met me before. But I’d never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained,
he said it was just as someone had promised.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Did he say who?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double
left you with this.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: An invitation. To a ‘formal picnic’…?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Did you say formal? I must dress.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I must say, you look more your old self –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You mean my other self …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Either way … may I ask: why you dress in that
fashion?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I should have thought that was obvious … I’m
in mourning.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I can’t wait to see afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Where’s the picnic?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ladies, gentlemen and bears …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Today is history. The first day of the
future. I welcome you to the first general meeting of the Wonderland
Corporation, now allied with our colleagues from Brolly …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You have all given time, money and expertise
to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a new phase of our operation.
From today, many of you will no longer be needed. I have to warn you
…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A cuckoo. The first sign of spring, and … A
cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is no longer secret. Agents are
investigating us. Their names are John Steed and Emma Peel. I believe we
have a traitor among us … perhaps more than one …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That remains to be seen. When we find the
traitors, they will be dealt with severely.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Here. In this building. By our estimate, they
will enter this room in thirty-five point five seconds precisely …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I am sorry the party is over. But we shall
meet again. To each of you a gift. A token of my appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: For you, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Another invitation. 38 Marlborough Terrace
…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Hm … A Veuve-Cliquot ’56 … But he bites the
end of his Monte Cristos … ? Clearly, we’re dealing with a maniac.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite
Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: How on earth can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn’t the
only shoemaker still practicing his trade …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Very good, Steed …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: What on earth?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological
Society …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Is that written in his shoe?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: She had this in her mouth. There, there…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Not again. There’s got to be another. way to
go about this.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Now, now … ‘I can’t give you anything but
love, baby…’</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Naughty teddy …</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No! You can’t …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ask not for whom the telephone rings, it
rings for thee …</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But I’ve got rid of her. She’s …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Go to the window … To the window.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Major D’Arcy … ?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Well, well. If it isn’t me …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: For you, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thanks … I see what you mean about letting me
do the risking … Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: Mrs. Peel … Come quickly. Brolly’s been
betrayed! I’ll tell you everything … The weather’s getting worse and
worse … they’re after me … coming for me … come quickly!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Sir August…? What now?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Ask Mother.</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: Mrs. Peel – ?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ask not for whom the telephone rings …</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: No, please! I beg you …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Walk over to the window …</p>
<p><strong>sir august</strong>: Let it be rain, please let it be –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stay by the window. By the window.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Emergency alert …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
Completely unpredicted …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Where’s Mother?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Mobile HQ. In a blue funk. Can’t take
chances. I’m looking after things while he’s hiding out …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’re probably wondering how I can drive
‘blind.’ Simple. A new prototype from the boys in X division.
Micro-sensors in the system read signals and road information. Converts
the info into miles per hour. Ultra-sensitive. Ultra-smart.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: We know one thing. That suspect was not
Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: So you say …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You don’t believe him?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It’s Mother you have to convince. He’s very
agitated. Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Don’t bother. Here’s a bus …</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Fares, please,</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather’s turning
quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of
Banffshire. The Ministry’s worried.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: He tried to warn us …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we
got there too late. Someone tipped them off …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Too late anyway. Today’s escapade was only
for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It’s manmade. A kind of
weather bomb.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Not quite. This is my field.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Is there anything that isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: The Prospero Project was started by my
husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global
warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought
of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and
satellite. A ‘quick fix’…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Filling in mother nature’s blind spots …
?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Exactly. There’d been earlier attempts to pump
carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it
captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical.
Too bulky …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: But if someone miniaturized the process…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: That’s what we were working on.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Sounds as if someone’s hijacked your
research.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Would it be possible to use it for military
purposes?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite
possible.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Where would they aim for?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: London. The World Council of Ministers meets
soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the
world.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: After the cold war …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: The hot and cold war …</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: New orders. The penultimate phase. Now fully
operational …</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: We’re not yet open for business, I’m
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for
something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Normally, we’d be eager to oblige –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Of course. Natural weather delivered to your
door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You don’t say. How real does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or
dry. Anything you like. Within reason.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: There are limits?</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: The technology is brand new. Soon it will be
more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We’ll
be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: No need. I’ll call again.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: My car. I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: A day in the country …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Three agents killed by bad weather…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: … And by you, Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret
defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: … And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to
you. No sisters? No undiscovered twin?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Not that I know of. Explanation?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: According to Dr. Darling, you’re a
psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from
recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of
anti-social and violent behavior. Q.E.D.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Oh, well … Just my type, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Do you always drive this fast?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? We’re
being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw’s …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Hold on …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Turn!</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Are you alright, young man?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I think so, thank you so much …</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Reach for the sky, pardner.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Oh, dear –</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a
baddy.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I feel sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I’m Alice. Mother said you’d be on your
way. Mrs. Peel with you?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: She was …</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: You with Mother or Father?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Both, actually.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Good. Glad to see they’re together at
last. They don’t get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a
fuss at the Ministry.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You don’t say. Like looking for a needle in a
…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
breathing?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Barely.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You will let me know if you find that queen
who’s in need of protection, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: This must be the last straw.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Here’s the one that broke the camel’s
back.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Someone didn’t want us to get to the
party.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I expect we’ll have to gatecrash.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I may be able to help you.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Wonderland Weather Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: This way …</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Over here …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Aha … Yes … It’s clear now. A trapezoid shape,
dictated by twin diagonal paths and a single curving path. A late
Seventeenth Century design, originally for King William of Orange,
copied… Ah …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: … Mrs. Peel? I think I’m seeing double
again.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now this is more like it …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Steed … !</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Mrs. Peel … ?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Mrs. Peel … ?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Mrs. Peel … ! Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Your lipstick …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Not again.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: It’s a trap. Tell Mother, beware. Tell
Father.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I wouldn’t shake that too hard. The weather
might turn nasty.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Quite a collection.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If nature gives a man a collector’s mind, it
doesn’t matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny
farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Your voice – it’s so familiar …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We have met …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Peter … ?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I must be dreaming …</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen… Very much alive.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Darling, it’s me…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Peter …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Impossible … how?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For you … all for you …</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t be afraid, darling.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t run away. I forgive you, Emma. I know
you left me. But I still love you. Do you still have my ring? I need
it.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Steed!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Oh, no. First time, shame on you. Third time,
shame on me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Diagnosis confirmed. Mrs. Peel is
suffering from delusions and hallucinations. An extreme personality
disorder. She imagines her husband Peter Peel has come back to her …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: A classic syndrome, to overcome her
subconscious guilt at her other crimes. We’ve attached her to the
dreamscape machine. We’ll soon see what her unconscious looks like…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists.
I’m so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you
were someone else …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Was I?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I expect that’s for you to know and me to
find out …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It was Peter – I saw him …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: This man – did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to
warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: I want you to say the first thing that
comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand … ? Blue
…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … bottle …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Red …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … head …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: White …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Knight …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Black…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … death …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Love…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … death …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Flower …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … power …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Nature …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … preserve…</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Secret …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … love…</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Hope…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … love …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Fear …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … love …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Peter …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers how
many pecks of pickled peppers did Peter Peel – ?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: How long have I been here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Three days.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Do you get paid by the hour?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You are here under observation, Mrs. Peel.
You must answer Dr. Darling’s questions</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I resign.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can’t
resign.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Watch me.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t open that, Mrs. Peel!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What are you trying to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We want to help…!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I thought I was a widow. My husband … the only
man I ever loved … is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with
that.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To
us all …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: To you … ?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I think you owe Mrs. Peel an explanation
…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior
operative. ‘X’ department Special operations. He was engaged in top
secret research. Top priority. Government approved.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: The Institute … the funding …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: A cover … for us. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: So all that time. Our work, our research was
for you … for this? And the accident –</p>
<p><strong>darling</strong>: It was no accident.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: The official investigation …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: … was written by me. It was sabotage,
Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Quite frankly … it could have been you.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You’re accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own
husband?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Her husband suspected someone very close to
the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to
himself – to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be
certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: … I want you to remember. Did Peter give you
anything on-that day?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: He said if it vanished, he’d know it
was … you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: So I’m still …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Under suspicion. Everyone died in the
explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were the only survivor …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No
need to take it personally. Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: To find out who killed my husband.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: The doors and walls are monitored,
Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: She must remain here. She’s highly
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel.
Unfortunately –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Guilty until proven innocent?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Mother and Father know best.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Something quick. Nothing too … messy.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: ‘… Sunny intervals leading to
sudden storms and gale warnings for all areas. … Outbursts of rain,
scattered hailstorms and freezing fog greeted the World Council of
Ministers as they arrived in London for their conference …’</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You followed me.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Orders.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: To kill me?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: A long way down.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Careful. You might fall.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I could save you the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: No trouble.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Because you always obey orders …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Always. Except …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Yes … ?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: … when I don’t. It comes down to one thing,
Mrs. Peel. Trust.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: And do you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I could be convinced, if … I knew who
poisoned me in the maze. That kiss …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It wasn’t me; you have my word.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I need proof.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: It was longer. On the lips.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Much longer. Approximately … fifteen
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … Ready?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … Four … seven … ni-…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Mmm … what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Keeping a stiff upper lip?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: So I’m in the clear?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But you did suspect me.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Not for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You’re playing games.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Aren’t we all, Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I thought you played by the rules.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I thought you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m playing to win.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Winning isn’t everything.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Please don’t tell me it’s how you play the
game.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: After you – Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No, after you.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You don’t trust me?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: As far as you trust me.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: When it happens, Steed, you’ll be the first to
know …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Who could that be?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: No – don’t answer it …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: That’s it. The phones trigger the explosions
–</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Don’t – don’t answer it – !</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Get down – get down – it’s going to explode –
!</p>
<p><strong>choirboy</strong>: It’s your mother.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Mother? How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I told Mother I took care of you.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You lied.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I equivocated. But you’re not their big worry
at present. It’s Dr. Darling: he’s disappeared …</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: We are in the final phase. I shall
require you to be especially obedient. There must be no failures.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this
affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No idea who. No idea why …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All
children’s things …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … Or grown-ups, who still like to be
children.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners.
There was nobody.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Very well. I have a friend who might be of
assistance. He’s at the Ministry. We’d better be careful.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m a wanted woman, I know …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: His name’s Jones. ‘Invisible’ Jones.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Why’s he called ‘Invisible’?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Aren’t you coming?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I’ll catch you up. Don’t worry; he’s
expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
Colonel Jones at your service, Mrs. Peel. Just a moment –</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That
usually helps. Don’t worry about me being invisible. Other than that I’m
perfectly normal.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Or rather, you don’t. Learnt the
tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can
I help you, Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I say, Trubshaw, Steed here … Barometer’s
falling fast. Mrs. Peel and I find ourselves in need of foul weather
gear. Yes, I’d say gentlemen’s snuff for starters. And then –</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to
play a hunch: Valentine Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Peter’s brother? But –</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Half-brother to be precise.</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Now let’s see … Eton, Cambridge …
research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter’s work on the
physics of climate change …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I know all this.</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Do you also know that during your
final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Surveillance? By whom?</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Father. She gave him an ‘all clear’
after a security test by Dr. Darling.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Who’s now vanished.</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and
Valentine were somehow in this together? But that’s absurd.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: We must hurry, Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Hurry? What for? I’m just now –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You didn’t tell her?</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: I was getting to it.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Getting to what?</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: The World Council of Ministers
meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I fail to see –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: There’s a reception this evening. Colonel
Jones thinks it advisable we attend.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Have we been invited?</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Under the circumstances Mother
didn’t see fit, but I think I can get you in …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Well, I can’t possibly go like this.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I had a feeling. That’s why we’re in a hurry
…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You may, Mr. Steed.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Inside that hall are some of the Most
powerful figures in the world. Tight security. Our only option.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’ll see to it personally.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: What’s that you’re wearing?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It’s called Black Leather.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From
Trubshaw’s.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: When all this is over, we simply must get you
out of that suit.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: … In the uncertain climate that threatens
this global initiative, no magic umbrella can shield us.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Only our own vigilance. Security and
stability are our watchwords.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Trubshaw again? What now?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Snuff. I must insist you try some.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: They’re playing your song, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: ‘The Merry Widow?’ I might have known. Where’s
the reception?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Oh, hello …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: We want Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Dead, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You disobeyed an order, Steed. Mrs. Peel is
dangerous; she cannot be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I think she can. Can you?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I shall summon security.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Bad news. Father’s looking for you. Where are
those bloody ministers?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Have a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: It’s almost May, for heaven sake.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach of
protocol. An emergency –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Quick –it’ll protect you –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: After him, Mrs. Peel!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Go – !</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Goodbye, Mrs. Peel!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Anyone ever tell you you look like a
housefly?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Anyone else need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can’t you throw her off?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where’d she go?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I thought it was Cinderella who lost her
slipper …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: This time the shoe’s on the other foot. You
said a hand-made shoe was as good as a photo-fit or D.N.A.? Well, all we
have to do is find the shoe that fits …</p>
<p><strong>trubshaw</strong>: It should be easy. A Trubshaw client has
his shoes delivered personally. The Ministry should be able to confirm
our delivery.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I’ll be back …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get
very nasty and I’ve no umbrella …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You needn’t bother. I can’t drag you further
into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: No bother. Mother and Father think I’ve
joined you. I might as well.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Oh, and by the way, I think it’s about time
you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: If you’d been through what I have, you
wouldn’t –</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: A microtag. One of Mother’s little toys.
There you are. Free at last.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Prince Charming, I presume. Your name is …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Oh my God …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Where’s Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>trubshaw</strong>: She just left, sir. In a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>trubshaw</strong>: She said you’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ah, here we are …</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: ‘X’ marks the spot. The shoes were
delivered to … an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On
the site of a former Ministry installation…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: … and now?</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Privately owned by …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Let me guess: Wonderland Weather.</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Very good, Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I shall need a small plane.</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: You’re not venturing alone,
surely.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m going to find out who killed my husband.
Will you take these documents to Steed?</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Tell him I said … goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Steed for you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Where’s Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I was hoping you could tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re getting yourself into terrible
trouble, my son. Weather’s turning very nasty – and so am I.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I’m going to follow up on a hunch of my own.
If I’m right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: In your operation.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m warning you for the last time, Steed:
whoever’s behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel
and kills like Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Steed?? Find Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a
worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of
winning.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: This isn’t a game.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Quite right, but we still make the rules.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Rules are made to be broken.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: People, too.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Then who wins?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You and I. Together. But first you must
confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer
is obvious …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yourself.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.
We’ve been expecting you. We hope you’ll enjoy your stay with us.
Decontamination is almost complete.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Decontamination – ?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: And you’ve a new wardrobe. He does want you
to look attractive. He tells me you’re very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Relax, Mrs. Peel. We’re hundreds of feet
below ground. The Ministry made it impregnable. No one can save you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Emma, my dear. How lovely you look.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Would that I could say the Same.</p>
<p><strong>dr. darling</strong>: Ah, but you haven’t see the real me.
Watch closely …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Peter …</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Darling Emma –</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It was you … all the time?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not really. Not quite. I’m afraid you still
don’t see …</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Valentine Peel …</p>
<p><strong>old teacher</strong>: Yes, I remember him quite well …</p>
<p><strong>old teacher</strong>: This is where he used to spend his
days. We have an old photograph somewhere …</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Absolute wizard with makeup. His favorite
roll from Shakespeare. Prospero …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: ‘The Prospero Project…’</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: … From The Tempest. A banished duke, ousted
by his brother, marooned on a magic island. Who controlled the
weather.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: ‘O Brave New World that hath such people in
it.’</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Darling Emma – yes, we: the true genius
behind the Prospero Project …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But you died – in the explosion …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: A slight miscalculation – my face was
burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in
handy …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Dr. Darling, Peter … all you …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: An unholy trinity …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You killed my husband.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: For starters. Of course I had to kill the
Teddy Bears, as well …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Too many cooks –</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Spoil the majority shareholders. In
Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting
you …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But I found you. All the clues led me here
…</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Of course. I planned that, too.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: But – why?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You disappoint me, Emma. Can’t you guess?
For you. It was all for you …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: ‘Our revels now are ended.’</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Oh, no, Emma. They’ve only just begun
…</p>
<p><strong>invisible jones</strong>: The shoes were delivered to an
island in the Serpentine - former Ministry installation … she said to
tell you goodbye. What?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I said it’s not goodbye yet. Listen, I’m
going to need some help. In a hurry …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Think of this as your second wedding
feast …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’m already married …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Come, come, you’re a widow – a most
attractive widow. Now I think of it, we’ll need a bridesmaid. Here.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: My latest model. A compound of plastics
and sensor chips. A big improvement on the old X404s. The poor thing is
quite fond of me. Emma, say hello to Emma.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You know, I believe she’s actually
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Valentine, listen to me …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left
out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Ring?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: How silly of me – let me make you
comfortable first …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: That’s better. I say, isn’t this where
you came in? It’s impenetrable, by the way …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You’re mad.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Entirely. On the other hand Mad people
get things done. Let me show you –</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Steed</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: How did you guess?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You reek of Mrs. Peel’s Black Leather …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: It was you who gave Valentine Peel his
security clearance … you’re the mole who betrayed the Ministry.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace
me with a younger Father. Errand boy that’s all I was. ‘Find Steed…’</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why
don’t you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: People expect weather to be free. They’re
used to it. I call that a denial of freedom. No freedom of choice. An
abuse of human rights. They buy water, electricity, gas. Why shouldn’t
they be able to buy their own weather if they want to? If they have a
little incentive …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Destruction of their local weather
systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: The result would be …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.
Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn … on a massive scale. You’ve
seen a few samples…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Then what’s stopping you?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: One very small thing. A diamond ‘cyclone’
chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I
possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was
developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to … you,
‘Mrs.’ Peel. I want you. But also your ring.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried
to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as
Dr. Darling. As myself I’ll be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan
will be complete.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: How Wagnerian … Do you mean to say you’ve
waited all these years because you couldn’t create a chip on your own?
That would have amused Peter.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Speaking of Peter, there’s more good
news: You won’t even have to change your last name. You’ll always be
Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What are my choices?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Choices?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ll never marry you.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: One out of two isn’t bad. I’ll keep you
alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, you may change your mind. If
you’re still in it.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: This little toy gave me back my face. It
can replace yours. What do you think? Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
Thatcher?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Dr. Darling, this is Father. We have an
intruder. I repeat –</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Ah. That will be Steed. He followed you.
Please excuse me. I have work to do. My most spectacular performance. A
ballet of clouds. It was made for you. I want to give you a heart, Emma.
I want all of London to see it. And now with this … They will. And for
an encore: the biggest cyclone in history will wipe the City from the
face of the earth. Shape of things to come, my darling.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: The things I do for England …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You must let me go …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Don’t you understand? If he has me, he’ll have
no use for you … he’ll destroy you …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Someone’s going to pay for this.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Start the countdown. Action stations.
Five minutes …</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Congratulations. The clouds are on course
…</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: To explode. London will be ashes.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Not yet! They haven’t heard our terms …
!</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Are you insane? Stop the program and you
activate the auto-destruct!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: But all those people – !</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: My cloud ballet! My cyclone!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Dense cloud formation moving south- west. On
course for the center of the city. A fog floating in from the river. The
prediction is … unstable chemical reaction. Enforce the curfew …
Emergency stand by … !</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: My dear. I wouldn’t want you to miss the
grand finale …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Find her. Kill her …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: John Steed.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Valentine Peel. I see you’ve gone back to
using your original face.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: The last one you’ll ever see.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Perish the thought.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Did they tell you at Eton that I was
fencing champion, too?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: They said you were a very naughty boy.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You’re better than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I was at Harrow …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: But did they teach you this?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Bang-bang … you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You wish.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: One shot – for emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: That’s not playing by the rules.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Rules are made to be broken.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: You said … one shot.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Did I? My mistake.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: I wouldn’t do that, if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Mrs. Peel – !</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Bullet-proof waistcoats – just the thing.
I get mine from Trubshaw’s. We’ll be off now, won’t we, darling? We
wouldn’t want to miss the fireworks. Figure it out if you can, Steed
…</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You must be joking …</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Fool …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: That will do.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Aren’t you forgetting about
something?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: You are, and it’s behind you.</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Come, come. You don’t really expect me to
fall for –</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Let go, you … idiot …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: I think she really likes you … Where’s
Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>valentine</strong>: Ugh …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Emma!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Emma …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Steed?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Mrs. Peel?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What kept you?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: The plot. Hello, we must be going …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Quick!</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: ‘The owl and the pussycat went to sea -’</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: ‘… in a beautiful pea green boat…’</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: A fine night, Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Still a bit chilly …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: English weather. You know, after all we’ve
been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Have you any place in mind?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: As a matter of fact I have …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I don’t recall Siberia being this warm,
Steed.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: It’s the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Our little paradise – just made for two?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Our chaperon.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Pity your mother came, too …</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Still a little warm, Trubshaw. Is this the
’28? A little more ice, I think …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Next assignment?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Ah … sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Must be. Trubshaw’s busy. I’ll send Mother
…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another
macaroon …</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Thank you, Steed.</p>
<p><strong>steed</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Peel.</p>
