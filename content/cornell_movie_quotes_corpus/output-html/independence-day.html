<p><strong>independence day</strong>: Dean Devlin &amp; Roland
Emmerich</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: If this isn’t an insanely beautiful
woman, I’m hanging up.</p>
<p><strong>tech one</strong>: Shut up and listen.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: God, I hope it’s not just another damned
Russian spy job.</p>
<p><strong>tech three</strong>: Negative. Computer affirms the signal is
unidentified.</p>
<p><strong>tech two</strong>: The boy from Air Res Traffic say the skies
are clear. No terrestrial launches.</p>
<p><strong>tech one</strong>: It’s the real thing. A radio signal from
another world.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Let’s not jump the gun. Run a trajectory
source computation.</p>
<p><strong>tech three</strong>: This can’t be right.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>tech three</strong>: Calculated distance from source is at
three hundred and eight five thousand kilometers. It’s coming from the
moon.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Who else knows about this?</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: S.E.T.I. in New Mexico
identified a signal but they’re even more confused than we are.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: Excuse me, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: Satellite reception has been
impaired but we were able to get these.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Looks like a big turd.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: We estimate it has a diameter of
over five hundred and fifty kilometers and a mass roughly one fourth the
size of our moon.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: A meteor?</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: No Sir. Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: Well, er… it’s slowing down.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: It’s doing what?</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: It’s… slowing down, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Get me the Secretary of Defense. Then
wake him up.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hi. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: Hi honey. What time is it there?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Two in the morning. I know I didn’t wake
you?</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: As a matter of fact you did.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: I have a confession to make. There’s a
beautiful young blonde sleeping next to me.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You didn’t let her stay up watching T.V.
all night?</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: You’re flying back right after the
luncheon? Okay, here she is.</p>
<p><strong>pundit #1</strong>: … the inexperience in public office was
inevitably going to catch up with him. He’s scarified his ideals for
"politics as usual."</p>
<p><strong>pundit #2</strong>: …I said this during the campaign.
Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War has no relationship to political
leadership. It’s a different animal…</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Daddy let me watch Letterman.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: Traitor.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Good morning, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: Good morning, George.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: You’re up early this morning, Connie.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: They’re not attacking your policies,
they’re attacking your age. "…addressing Congress, Whitmore seems less
like the President and more like the orphan child Oliver asking, ‘please
sir, I’d like some more.’"</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: Clever.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Age was never an issue when you stuck to
your gun. You were thought of as young and idealistic. But the message
has gotten lost. There’s too much compromise, too much politics.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: Isn’t it amazing how fast everyone can
turn against you.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Well, the Orange County Register has
named you one of the ten sexiest men of the year.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: You see, substance at last.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. President. It’s the
Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p><strong>whitmore</strong>: Yes? Say that again?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: What are you waiting? My social security
will expire, you’ll still be sitting there.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: So think already.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Again he’s thinking.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You have any idea how long it takes for those
things to decompose?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You don’t move soon. I’ll begin to
decompose.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Dad, don’t start.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: I’m only saying, it’s been what? Four years,
you still haven’t signed your divorce papers.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Three years.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Three, four. Move on. It’s not healthy.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Look who’s talking healthy.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: How many times is that now? You trying to
get fired?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Checkmate. See you tomorrow, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: That’s not checkmate I can still… Oh. You
could let an old man win once in a while, it wouldn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What the hell is the point of having a beeper
if you don’t turn it on?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What’s
the big emergency?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Started this morning. Every channel is making
like it’s nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one
knows what the hell is going on.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Damn it, Marty. There’s a reason we have bins
labeled "recycle."</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So sue me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Did you try to switch to transponder
channels?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Please, would I be this panicked if it was
that simple?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Let’s retrofit the dish to another
satellite.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We’ve tried. It’s not working. It’s almost as
though they weren’t even there.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s all fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: You’re gonna break it. Just leave it alone.
Here, take your medicine.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Just take it, dick head. Alicia! Make sure
he takes his medicine.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Morning, Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: You like these! I’ve got a whole goddamned
crop full!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: He had to re-fuel. There musta been a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: We both know what the problem is. He’s a
damned nut case, is what he is. I musta been out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Troy, stop it! I swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>lucas</strong>: Miguel, if he’s not in the air in twenty
minutes, that’s it. I’m getting someone else.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Stop it, Troy! I swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>aide #1</strong>: CNN is running a story that we’re covering
up some kind of nuclear testing experiments…</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Tell them to run with it if they want to
embarrass themselves.</p>
<p><strong>aide #2</strong>: NASA has been up my butt all morning. They
want to know our position.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Our official position is we don’t have an
official position.</p>
<p><strong>aide #3</strong>: Connie, what the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Come on, people. Would I keep you guys
out of the loop?</p>
<p><strong>aide #1</strong>: In a second!</p>
<p><strong>aide #2</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>sec. of defense</strong>: At the moment, our satellites are
somewhat unreliable. Isn’t it possible that thing may just pass us
by?</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: What if it doesn’t "pass us by?" Let’s
retarget some ICBMs to blow it out of the sky…</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Forgive me, but with the little
information we do have, the only thing that would accomplish is turn one
dangerous falling object into many.</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: What’s the damage?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: The press is making up their own stories
at this point.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Get on the horn with Atlantic Command.
Let’s upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: That’s not your call to make,
Mr. Nimziki.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Isn’t that a little premature?</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>sec of defense</strong>: We’re two days away from the fourth
of July. We have over fifty percent of our armed forces on weekend
leave, not to mention the troops and commanders we have in town for the
Fourth of July parade. We call them back now, we’re sending up a major
red flag.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: Our intelligence tells us the
object has settled into a stationary orbit.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Well that’s good news.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: Part of it has broken off into
nearly three dozen other pieces.</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: Pieces?</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: Smaller than the whole, yet over
fifteen miles in width themselves.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Where are they heading?</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: They should be entering our
atmosphere within the next twenty- five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Like it or not, we’re at DEFCON 3. Recall
the troops and put them on yellow alert.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Please, tell me you’re getting something.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s good news and bad news.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’s the bad news?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re in meal penalty for disturbing my
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: And the good news is you won’t charge me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No. The good news is I found the problem and
it’s not our equipment. There’s some weird signal embedded within the
satellite feed.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s the good news?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes, because the analog signal has a definite
sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact
binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated
spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block
out the overlay completely…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …and we’ll be the only guys in town with a
clear picture? That’s my man.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Russell! God damn it, Russell!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Just what the hell do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I’m bringing home the bacon. Earning my
keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: It’s the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas’ farm
is on the other side of town.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know
how hard it is to find someone who doesn’t think you’re completely
crazy?</p>
<p>****: What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to
go now?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Ensign, status?</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: We have a total radar black out over a
thirteen kilometer area.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Have a complete diagnostic run…</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: Excuse me sir, radar may be
malfunctioning but infrared is off the map!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Get the CINC Atlantic Command on the
line.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sir, we now have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi airspace.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: A second sighting?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yes Sir, this just came in from the
Eisenhower.</p>
<p><strong>commanding officer</strong>: Correction, we have two
confirmed visual contacts. One over Iraq, one over the Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Where in the Pacific? They’ve spotted
one off the California coast line.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …sightings of this atmospheric
phenomenon have been reported here in Novosibirsk, Russia and other
parts of Siberia. Moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor, astronomers
are baffled as to its origin…</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Mr. President, we have an AWAC on the
west coast. E.T.A. with contact point, three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>radar tech #1</strong>: It’s no use. Side radar doesn’t see a
thing!</p>
<p><strong>radar tech #2</strong>: That’s correct. We’re IMC blind,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Negative. We still have zero visibility.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Instrumentation is malfunctioning. We can’t
get any kind of reading on what’s in front of us.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Wait a minute, it may be clearing.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Jesus God! The sky’s on fire!</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Get them back on line.</p>
<p><strong>aide #1</strong>: Line’s gone, sir.</p>
<p><strong>aac cinc</strong>: Two more have been spotted over the
Atlantic. One is moving toward New York, the other is headed this
direction.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: How much time do we have?</p>
<p><strong>aac cinc</strong>: Less than ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Organize a military escort to Crystal
Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Sir, I strongly recommend we move you
to a secured location immediately.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Can we expect the same kid of panic here
as in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: More than likely.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Mr. President, you can discuss this on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m not leaving.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: We must maintain a working government in a
time of crisis…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I want the Vice President, Secretary of
Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured
location. I’m staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria
that could cost lives.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: But, Mr. President…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: So far these things have not become
hostile. For the moment let’s assume they won’t. Connie, let’s issue
statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take
cover.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: With your permission, Mr. President,
I’d like to remain my your side.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I had a feeling you would.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Sir, what happens if they do become
hostile?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Then God help us.</p>
<p><strong>female co-worker</strong>: David, are you watching this?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ve got a lock on the signal pattern. We can
filter it out.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Huh? Oh, good, hood.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Strange thing is, if my calculations are
right it’ll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal
reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are
you listening?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Can you believe this?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Haven’t you been watching?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: …so far the phenomenon has not caused any
damage. In all likelihood it won’t…</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: …everyone should remain calm. Take cover
where you can but the important thing is not to panic.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: …we have a fix on three different
occurrences about to appear over American cities. One is headed toward
Los Angeles…</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: …the other two are on our Eastern
seaboard headed towards New York and Washington, D.C…</p>
<p><strong>co-worker #2</strong>: Jamie says this building has an old
bomb shelter. We’re heading down there now.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Feel no shame in hiding.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh shit, I better call my wife.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic #1</strong>: Hey, Russ, heard you had a little
trouble this morning. Dusted the wrong field?</p>
<p><strong>mechanic #2</strong>: I know, you’re probably still a little
confused from your hostage experience.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic #2</strong>: Hostage experience? Something happen to
you, Russ?</p>
<p><strong>mechanic #1</strong>: He ain’t never told you!? Seems years
back our boy here had been kidnapped by aliens. Did all kinds of
experiments on him and such. Tell him, Russ.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Not today, guys. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic #1</strong>: You just gotta get a couple more beers
in him, he’ll tell you all about it. Crazy stuff. Won’t you, Russ?</p>
<p><strong>mechanic #1</strong>: Hey, Russ, when they took you up in
their space ship, they do any sexual things to you?</p>
<p><strong>co-worker #3</strong>: Aren’t you coming, David?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No way, I’ve got to see this.</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: Of course, Russia and the United
States are in this together. Yes, Mr. President, you have my word. Yes,
Das Vedanya.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: What is their position?</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: I think he was drunk.</p>
<p><strong>secret service guy</strong>: Mr. President, we have to
go.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My God. The signal.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Dylan, tell your mom you can stay
overnight again Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Mommy, look at!</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: It’s too early, baby.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Earthquake?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Not even a four pointer. Go back to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: Address the nation. There are a
lot of very frightened people out there right now.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Yeah. I’m one of them.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: He’s trying to impress you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: He’s doing a good job.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Neighbors are moving. I think they’re tired
of earthquakes.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …with little damage reported to the
southland area. People are advised not to panic…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hon, something’s on the table ’bout the
quake.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Dylan out there?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What have you been up to, Sport?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Shooting aliens.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You want milk with your coffee?</p>
<p><strong>wolf blitzer</strong>: Pentagon officials are reporting more
ships have just arrived over the capitals of India, England and
Germany.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I know, babycakes. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Tell her to get the kids and leave town.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just do it!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Babycakes, pack the kids up and take them to
your mother’s. Don’t ask. Go.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Remember I told you that the signal hidden
within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Not really…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That signal. It’s a countdown.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: A countdown to what?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Think. It’s like in chess. First you
strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing’s right. You
strike.</p>
<p><strong>blitzer</strong>: …there are additional unconfirmed sightings
over Japan, the Mediterranean, and China…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They are positioning themselves all over the
world and using this one signal to synchronize their efforts. In
approximately six hours the signal will disappear and the countdown will
be over.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Checkmate.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I gotta call my brother, my bookie, my
lawyer… fuck my lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: My fellow Americans, a historic
and unprecedented event has taken place. The question as to whether or
not we are alone in the universe has been answered…</p>
<p><strong>press aide</strong>: He says he’s your husband.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You have to leave the White House.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: This is not the time or the place to have
this same old discussion.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You don’t understand. You have to leave
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: In case you haven’t noticed, we’re in a
little bit of a crisis here.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ve worked with embedded loading. They’re
communicating with a hidden signal. They’re going to attack…</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: You’re being paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s not paranoia. The embedding is very
subtle. It’s probably been overlooked…</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: …My staff and I are remaining
here at the White House while we attempt to establish communication…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Pops!</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: The television said they’ve started with the
looting already Vultures.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You still got the Olds?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You want to borrow the car? You don’t have a
license.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s okay. You’re driving.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You can’t go. Call them back.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to
El Toro right away.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You said you were on leave for the
Fourth.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They cancelled it. Why are you acting like
this?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Why? That’s why. That thing scares the piss
out of me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Here. I got these for you. Be careful with
them.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Wait. I have to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Look, after your shift tonight, why don’t you
grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Really? You don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Naw. I’ll just tell my other girlfriends they
can’t come over tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You know, you’re not as charming as you
think you are.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Dick-weed!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Butt-munch.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: I’ll take these.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Mommmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: It’s the White House, for crying out loud.
You can’t just drive up and ring the bell.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can’t this thing go any faster?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You think they don’t know what you know?
Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know
everything.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They don’t know this.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: And you’re going to educate them? Tell me
something, you’re so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to
become a cable repairman?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: All I’m saying is they’ve got people who
handle these things, David. They want HBO, they’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: I want you out of there.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You’re staying there to keep people calm.
It’s the right thing to do. I’m not going to let them criticize you for
it.</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: Okay, fine but the second your
interviews are done, I have a helicopter ready to take you to Nellis Air
Force…</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: How’s the munchkin?</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: She’s glued to the T.V., just
like the rest of the world. I love you too. Here she is…</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: More ships keep arriving, fifteen in
total so far.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: This is crazy. We’re loosing our first
strike capabilities!</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: We’re trying to communicate with them
on all frequencies but we’re getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is
working on a type of visual communication.</p>
<p><strong>president whitmore</strong>: What the hell are they up
to?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …a local crop duster was arrested today
attempting to land at Edwards Air Force Base…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: They’ve got to do something. I was abducted
by space aliens ten years ago. They did all kinds of experiments on me.
They’ve been studying us for years, learning our weakness. We’ve go to
do something before they kill us all!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. whitmore</strong>: …we need to remain calm. As more
people decide to leave the cities, safety is key…</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Troy, you remember Uncle Hector, from
Tucson?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit,
right?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Yeah. What would you think if we went there
to live for a while?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: That’d be cool!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Pack up, we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What about Dad?</p>
<p><strong>older boy</strong>: This could be our last night on Earth.
You don’t want to die a virgin, do you?</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: What makes you think I’m a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Come on, we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: I’m not going anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: The whole world is trying to get out of
Washington and we’re the only schmucks trying to get in.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This, pops, is every phone book in
America.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You think an important person like Constance
is going to be listed?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She always keeps her portable phone listed,
for emergencies. Sometimes it’s just her first initial, sometime her
nickname…</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Nice driving, pops!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: …put your hands together for
Sabrina!</p>
<p><strong>newscasters</strong>: …from the "it could only happen in
California" file, hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered on the rooftops
of downtown Los Angeles, welcoming the new arrivals…</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: I can’t believe I even came in tonight.
What was I thinking?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: Isn’t this cool? And you thought I was
nuts. Oh, look, I brought mine with me.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You’re not thinking of joining those
idiots?</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I’m going over there soon as I’m off. Wanna
come?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Tiffany, I don’t want you to go up there.
Promise me you won’t. Promise!</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Okay. I’m gone. I’m outta town for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: What the hell’s your kid doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You try to find a sitter today.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: Where do you think you’re going? You leave,
you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Nice working with you, Mario.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Not listed, huh?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just haven’t found it yet. I tried C.
Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook…</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Spunky?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: College nickname.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You try Martin?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She didn’t take my name when we were
married.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: So what do I know?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Where the hell’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ah, were you guys waiting for me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can you believe it? This is serious shit,
Stevie. They’ve recalled everyone!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well, the mail’s still working.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Junk mail. You don’t want this.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t believe it. They make you learn how
to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you
down? What else do they want you to learn?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How to kiss ass.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had
them make it…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I thought you said you were doing to break it
off.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: So, you want to ring the bell or should
I?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Perfect, she’s using it.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: It’s perfect the line is busy?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her
exact position in the White House.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You can do that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: All cable repairmen can.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: …Sally, take my cat with when you leave.
No I’m staying here at the White House. Take care.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Connie, don’t hang up.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: David? How’d you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Walk to the window. Right in front of
you.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: What am I looking for?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: How does he do that?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: They let you out?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Just what the hell do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: We’re leaving, don’t try and stop us.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You’re not going anywhere. You hear me? I’m
still your father.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: No, you’re not! You’re just the man who
married my mother. You’re nothing to me!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Troy’s still my son no matter how you feel
about me.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: For once in your life think about what’s
best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you
screw up? Who?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Stop it! I’m not a baby! I don’t need your
stupid medicine. I don’t need anyone to take care of me!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: You know what this stuff costs? Do you want
to get sick again!? Do you!?</p>
<p><strong>cnn reporter</strong>: What you see behind me are four Apache
helicopters…</p>
<p><strong>cnn reporter</strong>: …each has been refitted with what
Pentagon officially hope will be our first step in communicating with
the alien craft…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>general gray</strong>: They’re in the air.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: And when is the countdown supposed to
expire?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I want you to leave with us. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: I can’t leave. We have to tell this to
the President.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He’s not going to listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Sure he’ll listen. Why wouldn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Because last time I saw him I punched him in
the face.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You punched the President in the face?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: He wasn’t the President then.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: David thought I was having an affair,
which I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Punched the President? Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Echo one, we are closing in.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: If I had known I was going to meet the
President, I’d a worn a tie. Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Wait here. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Not on his desk.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …the helicopters are making their final
approach…</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: You’re leaving now?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: I don’t know how you put up with him.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: He used to run the NASA. He knows where
all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What the hell’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: My ex-husband works in satellite
communications.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I don’t have time for this…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s about "Line o sight," Mr. President…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: …If you wanted t coordinate with ships all
over the world, you couldn’t send one signal to every place at the same
time. That’s called line of sight…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. President. They’re
starting.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Mr. President, they are using our own
satellites against us and the clock is ticking.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic
Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people
out of the cities as they can.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: But Mr. President…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And get those helicopters away from the
ship. Call them back immediately.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: They’re responding.</p>
<p><strong>secret serviceman</strong>: Mrs. Whitmore? The President has
ordered the evacuation. We have to leave, now.</p>
<p><strong>tiffany</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: …we are evacuating the city. Please leave
the building at once.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: …authorities have called for a complete
evacuation of Los Angeles County. People are advised to avoid the
highways whenever possible.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Now he tells me.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: They’re okay. Let them on!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Is my wife in the air?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: She should be shortly.</p>
<p><strong>believers</strong>: Take me! No, take me! Take me!</p>
<p><strong>secret serviceman</strong>: Mrs. Whitmore!</p>
<p><strong>radio newsman</strong>: …My God. It’s destroying everything
in its path. Widening…</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Boomer, come. Come boy!</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: …reports are unclear as to the extent of the
devastation, but from all accounts, Los Angeles, Washington and New York
have been left in ruins…</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Guys, I don’t feel so good.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: When was the last time you had your
medicine?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Four days… five?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: But I gave you some this morning.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I didn’t take it. I thought I didn’t need it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Miguel? Come take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You will be the first wave in our counter
attack. Though surveillance satellite reconnaissance has been impaired,
we have a fix on our primary target.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You won’t exactly need radar to find it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You want to add something to this briefing,
Lt. Hill?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry, Sir. Just real anxious to kick some
alien ass.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: You saved a lot of lives.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I could have evacuated the cities hours
ago. You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew
what we had to do. It’s not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died
today. How many didn’t have to?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Any news on my wife?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: The helicopter never arrived at Nellis
and there’s been no radio contact.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: All satellites, microwave and ground
communications with the cities are gone. We believe we’re looking at a
total loss.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: ETA with target; four minutes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jimmy crack corn, do you have victory
dance?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That is an affirmative. I have victory dance.
Mmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Don’t get premature on me, Jimmy. We don’t
light up ’til the Fat Lady sings.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: It’s Air Force One for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Moishe, please, don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Look at me, like a rock. Good weather, bad,
doesn’t matter. We can go up and down, back and forth, side to side…</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: What I say?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: He still gets air sick, huh? In all of
this I didn’t get the chance to thank you two.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Think nothing of it, Spanky.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Spunky. He told you about that?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: All he could think about was getting to you.
There’s still love there I think.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Love was never our problem.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart
man. Shot in the back, very sad.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I shouldn’t have left her.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t worry, big guy. I’m sure she got out of
here before it happened.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s lock and load.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Los Angeles attack squadron has AMRAAM
missiles locked on target.</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: Washington and New York squadrons,
reporting lock on.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Fire at will.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I didn’t even see them fire!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Command, Eagle One. Switching to
"sidewinders." We’re moving in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They must have some kind of protective shield
surrounding their hull. Pull up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Evasive maneuvers! Check Six!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Got you covered, Stevie.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shit! They’ve got shield too.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jimmy, roll right. I’ll cover.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: We’re losing them.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Then get them out of there.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: We’ve lost the satellite.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Maybe we can out run them. Follow my
lead.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jimmy, kick it! They’re gaining.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’re already over Mach 2!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So push it!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Stevie… I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jimmy, stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No!!!!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: We have incoming.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Friendly?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay, jerk-off. Let’s have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s see if you’re fully equipped.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Now that’s a close encounter.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Mommy, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: I don’t know, badly.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You know, you’re just like your mother. She
was stubborn too. I had to twist her arm to get her to take her
medicine.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m sorry, Dad. I’m not goin to die like mom,
am</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: You’re going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: I couldn’t find anything. Everyone is
packing up, they’re leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this
way.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: We should leave too.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: There’s a group heading south, they said
there’s a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow
them.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Penicillin. At least it will help keep his
fever down.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: It’s really nice of you to help us.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I wish I could do more but we’re moving
out.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: We’re going with you. I mean, we’re going
too.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: They must be targeting our satellites.
We’ve lost all satellite communication, tracking and mapping.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Have NORAD relay intelligence to our
on board computers?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: We’ve moved as many of our forces away
from the bases as possible but we’ve already sustained heavy losses.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: I spoke with the Joint Chief when they
arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a
full nuclear strike. Hit ’em with everything we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Above American soil?</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: If we don’t strike soon, there may not be
much of an America left to defend.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: What’s the latest from NORAD?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: It’s gone, sir. They’ve taken out</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: That’s impossible…</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: My God, the Vice President and the
Joint Chiefs…</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now
would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You can’t be seriously considering firing
nuclear weapons?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: David, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If you fire nukes, so will the rest of the
world. Do you know what that kind of fall out will do? How many innocent
people…</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Sir, i remind you that you are just a
guest here…</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: David, please…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This is insanity! You’ll kill us and them at
the same time. There’ll be nothing left!</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Sit down and shut up!</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Don’t tell him to shut up! You’d all be
dead, were it not for my David. You didn’t do anything to prevent
this!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Sir, there wasn’t much more we could have
done. We were totally unprepared for this.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Don’t give me unprepared! Since nineteen
fifty whatever you guys have had that space ship, the thing you found in
New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Dad, please…</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: What was it, Roswell? You had the space
ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area
fifty one. That’s it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn’t do
nothing!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Regardless of what the tabloids have
said, there were never any space crafts recovered by the government.
Take my word for it, there is no Area 51 and no recovered space
ship.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but that’s
not entirely accurate.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: The end has come! He speaketh his word and
the end hast come!</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Hop on. We’re heading out to El Toro.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: You cannot defy what has come, it is the
end!</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Give me a hand.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Let’s get her out of here.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: She’s bleeding pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Who’s got the key?</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: Looks like I’ve solved our transportation
problem.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Hey, you’re welcome to come with us. We’re
leaving here anyway…</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: We’re not. Give me the key. Get ’em
off.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Repent! Sinners! Repent! The end hast
come!</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: Back off. This ain’t your business.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: You cannot go against the word,
brother.</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: Sure I can.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: This "bitch" was born in Alabama with a
Daddy who loved to hunt. So don’t think for one second that I don’t know
how to use this.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: When I flew overhead, I saw some kind of
base, not far.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: It’s not on the map.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Trust me, it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Why the hell wasn’t I told about this
place?</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Two words, Mr. President. Plausible
deniability.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I don’t understand. Where did all this
come from? How did this get funded?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: You didn’t think they actually spent ten
thousand dollars for a hammer and thirty thousand for a toilet seat, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Mr. President, I’d like to introduce you
to Dr. Okun. He’s been heading up our research here for the last fifteen
years.</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don’t let
us out much, you you.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Well, I guess you’d like to see the big
tamale? Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: She’s a beaut, ain’t she?</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: Never any space ships recovered by the
government, huh?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We’ve had this for forty years and you
don’t know anything about them?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Hell no, we know tons about them. The nearest
stuff has only happened in the last few days.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: People are dying out there. I don’t think
"exciting" is the word I’d choose to describe it!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What can you tell us about the enemy
we’re facing?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold…probably why they’re interested in
our planet. Hey, you wanna see them?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: This is vault, or as some of us have come to
call it, the "freak show."</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: When we found them they were wearing
bio-mechanical suits. Once we got them off, we were able to learn a
great deal about their anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar digestive system… no
vocal cords though. We’re assuming they communicate with each other
through other means.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What kind of other means? Hand signals, body
language?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Some kind of extra sensory perception.
Telepathy.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Can they be killed?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: These three died in the crash. Their bodies
are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology,
which is, I’m sorry to say, far more advanced.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You unlocked a part of that technology.
You cracked their code.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: All I did was stumble onto their signal. I
don’t know how helpful I can be…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Show them what you’ve discovered. Work
together. We’ve got to find a way to beat them.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can’t open the gates
without clearance.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You want to see my clearance?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: See the gizmos flashing?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Someone grab my laptop for me?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Find something interesting?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: These patterns here, they’re repeating
sequentially, just like…</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: You know, you’re really starting to make us
look bad.</p>
<p><strong>techy</strong>: They got one! They got one, alive!</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: How long has it been unconscious?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Excuse me Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Three hours.</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Get him into containment, stat.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: My boy is very sick, he needs immediate
attention.</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: He’s dying out. I want him sprayed down with
saline.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: My boys is slipping into a diabetic coma.
If you don’t do something about it right now he will die.</p>
<p><strong>dr. isaacs</strong>: O’Haver, Miller, come with me. Take us
to him.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: You were the head of the National
Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on
informing the rest of us!?</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: It had been deemed classified.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Christ, why didn’t you say anything
about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we
launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: And there are scattered reports of
sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And our forces?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: We’re down to approximately fifteen
percent, Sir. If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city
and move on, we’re looking at world wide destruction of every major city
within the next thirty six hours.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We’re being exterminated.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Mr. President, this is Lt. Colonel Steven
Hill.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Lieutenant, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Where is the prisoner now?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: We have him in isolation. The doctors are
very hopeful he will survive.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’d like to see him.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: General, I’m anxious to get back to El
Toro.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Didn’t anyone tell you? I’m sorry. El
Toro was destroyed in the attack.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: These should last us a while.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Don’t move. Stay still.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Your son.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: He’s my angel.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Was his father stationed here?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: He wasn’t his father. I was kinda hoping
he’d want the job, though.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So, what do yo do for a living?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: I’m a dancer.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Really? Ballet?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: No. Exotic.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Oh. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Don’t be. I’m not. It’s good money. ’Side,
he’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: And when the dancing’s over? What about
your future?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Funny, it used to scare me when I thought
about the future. Guess it doesn’t really matter anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the
First Lady.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I thought you didn’t recognize me.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Didn’t want to say anything. I voted for
the other guy.</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Everyone ready?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Do we have life support monitors
recording?</p>
<p><strong>med assist #2</strong>: Yes. If we fuck up it’ll all be on
tape.</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Can we get some ventilation in here? I can’t
take this smell.</p>
<p><strong>med assist #2</strong>: They’ve conquered space travel but
not b.o.</p>
<p><strong>med assist #1</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>okun</strong>: Yeah. It’s just that stink gives me a
headache.</p>
<p><strong>med assist #2</strong>: He’s moving!</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: Release…me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Open the door. Get him out of there.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Wait. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: Will kill…release me. Now!</p>
<p><strong>solider</strong>: What the hell are you doing? Get out of
there!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m just going to borrow it.</p>
<p><strong>solider</strong>: No you’re not, sir.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You really want to shoot me?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Shit. I’m gonna catch the hell for
this.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Why did you people come here?</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: Air…water…your "sun."</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Where do your people come from? Where is
your home?</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: Here…now.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And before here?</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: Many worlds…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Can we negotiate a truce? is there room
for co-existance? Can there be peace between us?</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: Peace? No peace.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What do you want us to do?</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: Die.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>okun/alien</strong>: We kill you…all.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Is that glass bullet proof?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>staffer</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Mr. President, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: He wanted me to understand. He
communicated with me. They’re like locusts. They travel from planet to
planet, their whole civilization. After they’ve consumed every natural
resource they move on. And we’re next.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Prepare a nuclear strike.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just my luck, no ice.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: I take it you’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A toast to the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: He didn’t come to this decision
lightly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You still believe in him.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: He’s a good man.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Better be. You left me for him.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: I wanted a career. Didn’t you ever want
to be part of something special?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was part of something special.</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: We’ve got the AWAC on line. Signals
coming in low.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Who will we reach first?</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: Houston, Texas. Intercept ETA, six
minutes and counting down.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Oh my God, Houston.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: The major cities have been deserted.
Civilian casualties should be at a minimum, sir.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We have laser targeting locked.</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: Target is locked, sir. Do you wish to
deploy?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Mr. President, do you wish to
deploy.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Deploy.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: She’s away.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: May our children forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: It’s a hit!</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: We got the bastards!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Can they see it? Did it destroy the
target?</p>
<p><strong>tank commander</strong>: Negative. Target remains.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Call them back.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: The other bombers might have more luck. We
shouldn’t just give up…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I said call them back.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know how I like to make a big
entrance.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. President. If only we could
have gotten to her sooner.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: She’s bleeding internally. There’s nothing
else we can do.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Hiya Munchkin.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Mommy, we were worried. We didn’t know
where you were.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m right here, baby.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Honey, why don’t you wait outside so
Mommy can get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I’m scared, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: It’s okay. The doctors said you’re going
to be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I just wanted to thank you. You’re a very
brave woman.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Is Mommy sleeping now?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Yes, baby. Mommy’s sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: David, David! What the hell are you
doing!?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m making a mess.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: This I can see.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ve gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump
toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this
planet up enough they won’t want it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: David, you’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: I think you better sleep this off. Go back
inside before you catch a cold.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Pops, you’re a genius!</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: What’d I say?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A cold? Of course.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: All right, Connie, we’re here. What’s this
all about?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: I really have no idea. He just said to
bring everyone down here.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Does that thing fly in outer space?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It certainly does.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Could anyone please step back away from the
craft?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Lt. Mitchell, would you mind drawing your
pistol?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: From where you’re standing, do you think you
could shoot that can off the alien craft?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sorry ’bout that. You see, it’s protected by
the craft’s shields. We can’t penetrate their defenses.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: We know that already. What’s your
point?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My point is if we can’t beat their defenses,
then we must get around them.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Lt. Mitchell, would you please try to shoot
it again?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I gave it a cold.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Are you telling us you can send out a
signal that will disable all their shields?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just as they used our satellites against us,
we can use their own signal against them.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: And just how do we infect the "Mother Ship"
with a virus?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ll have to fly their craft out of our
atmosphere and dock with the mother ship.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: How long would their shields be
down?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Once they discover the virus it could be a
matter of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: You want us to co-ordinate a massive world
wide counter strike with a window of only a few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: With their shields down it might be
possible.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: Please, you’re not buying into any of this
nonsense, are you? We don’t have the manpower or the resources to launch
that kind of a campaign. Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan
is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to
operate.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I wouldn’t say that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ve seen them in action. I’ve watched their
maneuvers. With your permission, sir, I’d like the opportunity to
try.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: That thing’s a wreck. It crash landed back
in the fifties! We don’t even know if it’s capable of flying.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Remove the clamps!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Any other questions?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: I understand that you’re upset over the
death of your wife but that’s no excuse for making another fatal
mistake…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: The only mistake I made was appointing a
sniveling little weasel like you Chief of Staff.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: He can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: He just did.</p>
<p><strong>reginald</strong>: …we’ve been told that there may be
additional re-enforcement in hiding near the Golan Straights…</p>
<p><strong>reginald</strong>: What the hell’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>thomson</strong>: Seems they’re getting a signal. One Morse
code.</p>
<p><strong>reginald</strong>: I still get believe this.</p>
<p><strong>thomson</strong>: The Iraqis don’t appear altogether too
pleased with this arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>reginald</strong>: How do you think the Israelis feel?</p>
<p><strong>thomson</strong>: It’s from the Americans. They want to
organize a counter offensive.</p>
<p><strong>reginald</strong>: It’s about bloody time. What do they plan
to do?</p>
<p><strong>russian #1</strong>: They claims to be able to bring down
their shields.</p>
<p><strong>russian #2</strong>: When do they want to attack?</p>
<p><strong>japanese pilot</strong>: The attack begins in thirteen
hours.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How’re we doing?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Better than we thought.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: We have confirmed divisions of troops
from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle
East and Asia are battle ready.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And our troops here?</p>
<p><strong>generale grey</strong>: We’ve been collecting planes from all
over but…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: But what, General?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Pilots, sir. We don’t have enough
people to get them in the air.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Then find them.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: How’ he doing?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Just fell asleep. He’s gonna be just fine.
Join me in a little celebration?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Miguel. Don’t be mad. Miguel!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: …We’re planning to launch a counter
offensive…</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I can fly, I mean, I’m a pilot.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: You don’t understand. I’ve gotta be part of
this. This is important to me. They ruined my life.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Why don’t you go somewhere and sleep it
off.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: We’ve hid the launcher in the ship’s
manifold.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s just like an AMRAAM launch pad on the
stealths.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Exactly. Use it the same way. Only the
nuke won’t detonate on impact. You’ll have another thirty seconds to get
as far away as you can.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll see how they’re doing with the radio
transmitter.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh shit, we’re late.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Thirty seconds? Isn’t that cutting it a
little too close?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’ll be well on our way out of there before
we shoot that thing off.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s the strongest SHF transmitter we
could get. It’ll tell us when you’ve uploaded the virus.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Then cross your fingers the shields go
down.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: With you? I don’t understand why you
can’t just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for
this kind of mission?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If anything goes wrong I’ll have to think
quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know how I’m always trying to save the
planet. This is my chance.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Now he gets ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: It’s too tight.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: I had to borrow it. I guess that’s good
enough.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You’re a lot of help.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know me…</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: I know, you like to make a big
entrance.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Before we do this, I want you to know I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Sorry for what?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I should have done this a long long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Do you have the ring?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: Witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>chaplain</strong>: Then let’s get this show on the road.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Beggars can’t be choosers, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Good morning. In less than one hour
planes from here and all around the world will launch the largest aerial
battle in the history of mankind… Mankind. The word has new meaning for
all of us now. We are reminded not of our petty differences but of our
common interests.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Mr. President, just what do you think
you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m a pilot, Will. This is where I
belong.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: When I’m back we’ll light those
fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: David, take these.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thanks, Pops.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: I want you should know, I’m very proud of
you, son.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Damn it. We can’t go yet. I gotta find some
cigars.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: My last two. With my blessings.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re a lifesaver.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hang on to this. For our victory dance. But
not ’til we hear the fat lady sing.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I have a confession to make. I’m not real big
on flying.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You ready? Let’ rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let’s try that again.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Just getting a feel for her.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Grey, you read me?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Roger, Eagle One, our primary target
has shifted course.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Where’s it headed?</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: I think our secret is out. They’re
headed right for us.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: ETA thirty six minutes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You still with me?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ve waited a long time for this.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s it. Head straight for it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Something’s happening. It’s not
responding.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was counting on that. They’re bringing us
in.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We have visual.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Do not engage until we’ve confirmed
the package has been delivered.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: What if that thing gets here before we
can plant the virus?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The entire compound is buried deep within
the mountain. It should give us some protection.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: But what about all the people
outside?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Must be thousands of them. What are they
doing?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Looks like they’re preparing the
invasion.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This won’t work. They’ll see before we can do
anything.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: These things are fully equipped. Reclining
bucket seats, power windows…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re in!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: He’s uploading the virus.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Eagle One…</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: …the package is being delivered. Stand
by to engage.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Let me get that.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Where’s Russell?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Hurry, we’ve got to get everyone
inside.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The virus is in. All we can do now is
pray.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Delivery complete. Engage.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Keep your fingers crossed.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Come on, baby.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: It didn’t work. Disengage. Sir, get
your people out of there.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Not yet!</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: You did it! A direct hit!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We’re going in! Squadron leaders, take
point.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Russell!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Get us out of here!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I can’t shake her free.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s not me. They’re overriding the
system.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Check and mate.</p>
<p><strong>nimziki</strong>: I’m not Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>moishe</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>alicia</strong>: This could be our last night on Earth. I
don’t want to die a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: If we do, we’ll both die virgins. But at
last we’ll be together.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We’re running out of missiles, Sir. We’re
just not causing enough damage.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: They’re getting ready to fire the big
gun. You’re going to have to find a vulnerable spot, fast.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’ve got an idea. Keep ’em off my
tail.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Let’s take ’em out before they take us
out.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m out of missiles! Eagle 2?</p>
<p><strong>eagle #2 pilot</strong>: I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: We’re out of time. Get out of there!
Get as far away as you can.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Doesn’t anyone have any damned missiles
left?!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Sorry I’m late, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Who is that? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: It’s okay, Sir. I’m packin’.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Just keep those guys off me for a few more
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Do me one favor…</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Who is that guy?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Russell!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: …tell my children I love them very
much.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Dad! No!</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: I’ve got to, kid. You were always better at
taking care of them than I was anyways.</p>
<p><strong>general grey</strong>: Let’s get on the wire. Tell every
squadron around the world how to shoot those fuckers down.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I guess there’s nothing left to do. Let’s
nuke ’em.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Funny, I always thought things like these
would kill me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You as well.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Think they know what’s coming?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Not a chance in hell.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’re loose!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Doesn’t matter. Game’s over.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t hear no fat lady.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Any word from Steve?</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: You scared the hell out of me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, but what an entrance!</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Dick-weed.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Butt-munch.</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>constance</strong>: You bet it did.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We’re getting reports from all over.
Their ships are going down!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Didn’t I promise you fireworks?</p>
