<h1 id="gandhi">gandhi</h1>
<p><strong>house servant’s voice</strong>: He will be saying prayers in
the garden – just follow the others.</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong>: Brother – Bapu is already late for
prayers.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Oh, God… oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>murrow</strong>: …The object of this massive tribute died as
he had always lived – a private man without wealth, without property,
without official title or office…</p>
<p><strong>murrow’s voice-over</strong>: Mahatma Gandhi was not a
commander of great armies nor ruler of vast lands, he could boast no
scientific achievements, no artistic gift… Yet men, governments and
dignitaries from all over the world have joined hands today to pay
homage to this little brown man in the loincloth who led his country to
freedom…</p>
<p><strong>murrow’s voice-over</strong>: Pope Pius, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, President Truman, Chiang Kai-shek, The Foreign Minister of
Russia, the President of France… are among the millions here and abroad
who have lamented his passing. In the words of General George C.
Marshall, the American Secretary of State, “Mahatma Gandhi had become
the spokesman for the conscience of mankind…”</p>
<p><strong>murrow’s voice-over</strong>: …a man who made humility and
simple truth more powerful than empires.” And Albert Einstein added,
“Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in
flesh and blood walked upon this earth.”</p>
<p><strong>murrow’s voice-over</strong>: … but perhaps to this man of
peace, to this fighter who fought without malice or falsehood or hate,
the tribute he would value most has come from General Douglas McArthur:
“If civilization is to survive,” the General said this morning, “all men
cannot fail to adopt Gandhi’s belief that the use of force to resolve
conflict is not only wrong but contains within itself the germ of our
own self-destruction.”…</p>
<p><strong>murrow’s voice-over</strong>: Perhaps for the rest of us, the
most satisfying comment on this tragedy comes from the impudent New York
PM which today wrote, “There is still hope for a world which reacts as
reverently as ours has to the death of a man like Gandhi.”…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Tell me – do you think about hell?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: “Hell!”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No – neither do I. But… but this man is a
Christian and he has written –</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been
in South Africa?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: A – a week.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Well, I don’t know how you got a ticket for
–</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Here – coolie, just what are you doing in
this car?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Why – I – I have a ticket. A First Class
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: How did you get hold of it?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I sent for it in the post. I’m an attorney,
and I didn’t have time to –</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: There are no colored attorneys in South
Africa. Go and sit where you belong.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: I’ll take your luggage back, baas.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No, no – just a moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You see, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Attorney at
Law. I am going to Pretoria to conduct a case for an Indian trading
firm.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Didn’t you hear me? There are no colored
attorneys in South Africa!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Sir, I was called to the bar in London and
enrolled in the High Court of Chancery – I am therefore an attorney, and
since I am – in your eyes – colored – I think we can deduce that there
is at least one colored attorney in South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>european</strong>: Smart bloody kaffir – throw him out!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: You move your damn sammy carcass back to
third class or I’ll have you thrown off at the next station.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I always go First Class! I have traveled all
over England and I’ve never…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: But you’re a rich man – why do you put up
with it?</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: I’m rich – but I’m Indian. I therefore do not
expect to travel First Class.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: In England, I was a poor student but</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: That was England.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: This part of “England’s” Empire!</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and see a
successful Muslim trader. The South Africans see him simply as an
Indian. And the vast majority of Indians – mostly Hindu like yourself –
were brought here to work the mines and harvest the crops – and the
Europeans don’t want them doing anything else.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: But that is very un-Christian.</p>
<p><strong>tyeb mohammed</strong>: Mr. Gandhi, in this country Indians
are not allowed to walk along a pavement with a “Christian”!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your
attorney, but you can’t walk down the street with him?</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter
by someone less “holy” than Mr. Baker.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Well, then, it must be fought. We are
children of God like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: Allah be praised. And what battalions will you
call upon?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I – I will write to the press – here – and
in England. And I will use the courts.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: You will make a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We are members of the Empire. And we come
from an ancient civilization. Why should we not walk on the pavements
like other men?</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: I rather like the idea of an Indian barrister
in South Africa. I’m sure our community could keep you in work for some
time, Mr. Gandhi – even if you caused a good deal of trouble. Especially
if you caused a good deal of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: There’s the English reporter. I told you
he’d come.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: You also said your article would draw a
thousand people. At least some of the Hindus brought their wives.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No. I asked my wife to organize that.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: Some of them are leaving…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, we have asked you to
gather here to help us proclaim our right to be treated as equal
citizens of the Empire.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We do not seek conflict. We know the
strength of the forces arrayed against us, know that because of them we
can only use peaceful means – but we are determined that justice will be
done!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: The symbol of our status is embodied in this
pass – which we must carry at all times, but no European even has to
have.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And the first step to changing our status is
to eliminate this difference between us.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: You write brilliantly, but you have much to
learn about handling men.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: fluent, but firm and</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: We will now burn the passes of our committee
and its supporters. We ask you to put your passes on the fire with –</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: Oh, no, you bloody well don’t!</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: Those passes are government
property! And I will arrest the first man who tries to burn one!</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: Take him away!</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: Now – are there any more?!</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: You little sammy bastard – I –</p>
<p><strong>police sergeant</strong>: You want that kind of trouble – you
can have it!</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You saved the papers.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: I wish you were still struggling for work in
Bombay.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I hated that – all the pettiness, the little
corruptions. And I was more laughing stock than lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: But they needed me here. If I’d never been
thrown off that train, perhaps no one would ever have needed me.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: “A high court judge has confirmed that
Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault
since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest.” – I told you about
English law.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: As I told you about English policemen.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>harilal</strong>: We are glad to have you back, Bapu.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And I am glad to be back. Come…</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Tomorrow I will tell you what it feels like
to be a jailbird.</p>
<p><strong>ayah</strong>: Come. Come.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Just like proper English gentlemen. I’m
proud of them.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: They are boys. – And they’re Indian.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Hm. Will you take this off? It pinches every
time I speak.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Here, you see? Even the South African papers
apologize – “a monstrous attack.”</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Yes – I can’t talk like this.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Pull!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Oww!</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Mr. Khan said they called you brave.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If you would let me teach you to read, you
could see for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: I could have told them you were merely
foolish.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It proves what I told you. If I had
prosecuted him as everyone advised – even you – they would have hated me
– by showing forgiveness I – ouch!</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: There…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You see there is such a thing as moral force
– and it can be harnessed.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Not always. You have told me twice now that you
were giving up the pleasures of the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am. I am convinced the holy men are right.
When you give up, you gain. The simpler your life the better.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I will fast tomorrow – as a penance.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: If you enjoy it a great deal you must fast for
two days.</p>
<p><strong>tall civil servant</strong>: The London papers have arrived
from the Cape, sir.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Yes – ?</p>
<p><strong>tall civil servant</strong>: The worst was the Daily Mail,
sir. They said, “The burning of passes by Mr. Gandhi was the most
significant act in colonial affairs since the Declaration of
Independence.”</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Did they? Well, they’ll find we’re a little
better prepared this time. Mr. Gandhi will find he’s on a long hiding to
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’d be Gandhi – …I thought you’d be
bigger.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I – I mean it’s all right. It doesn’t
matter. I’m – my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I’ve come from India
– I’ve read a great deal about you.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Some of it good, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Would you care to walk?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You’re a clergyman.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes. I’ve – I’ve met some very remarkable
people in India… and – and when I read what you’ve been doing here, I –
I wanted to help. Does that surprise you?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not anymore. At first I was amazed… but when
you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up – like you –
right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or –</p>
<p><strong>first youth</strong>: Hey – look what’s comin’!</p>
<p><strong>second youth</strong>: A white shepherd leading a brown
sammy!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Perhaps I should –</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Doesn’t the New Testament say, “If your
enemy strikes you on the right cheek, offer him the left”?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think perhaps the phrase was used
metaphorically… I don’t think our Lord meant –</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m not so certain. I have thought about it
a great deal. I suspect he meant you must show courage – be willing to
take a blow – several blows – to show you will not strike back – nor
will you be turned aside… And when –</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: …and when you do that it calls upon
something in human nature – something that makes his hate for you
diminish and his respect increase. I think Christ grasped that and I – I
have seen it work.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>first youth</strong>: Get off the pavement, you bloody –</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: Colin! Colin! What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>first youth</strong>: Nuthing… nuthing. We were just cleaning
up the neighborhood a little.</p>
<p><strong>colin’s mother</strong>: You’re already late for work. I
thought you’d gone ten minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You’ll find there’s room for us both.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That was lucky.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I thought you were a man of God.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I am. But I’m not so egotistical as to
think He plans His day around my dilemmas.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: …you could call it a “communal farm,” I
suppose. But we’ve all come to the same conclusion – our Gita, the
Muslim’s Koran or your Bible – it’s always the simple things that catch
your breath – “Love thy neighbor as thyself” – not always practiced –
but it’s something we Hindus could learn a lot from.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s the sort of thing you’ll be seeking
on this “farm”…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Well, we shall try.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: They’re going to change the pass laws.</p>
<p><strong>smuts’s voice-over</strong>: It’s taken time, but it needed
to be done fairly. We didn’t want to create an injustice simply because
Mr. Gandhi was abusing our existing legislation.</p>
<p><strong>second voice</strong>: Just one second, sir, please.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: But on a short trip, I wouldn’t spend too
much time on the Indian question, Mr. Walker. It’s a tiny factor in
South African life.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It’s news at the moment. I will certainly
report on your mines and the economy – but I would like to meet this
Mr. Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Of course. We Westerners have a weakness for
these – these spiritually inclined men of India. But as an old lawyer,
let me warn you, Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man as you will ever meet,
however “otherworldly” he may seem. But I’m sure you’re enough of a
reporter to see that.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: …so it’s not “spiritualism” or “nationalism”
– we’re not against anything but the idea that people can’t live
together.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You see – Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jews –
even Christians.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Mr. Walker! Of The New York Times!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Without a paper – a journal of some kind –
you cannot unite a community. You belong to a very important
profession.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Hm. And what should an “important
professional” write about your response to General Smuts’s new
legislation?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I don’t know… I’m still searching for a
“response.”</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You will respect the law.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: There are unjust laws – as there are unjust
men.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You’re a very small minority to take on the
Government – and the Empire.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If you are a minority of one, the truth is
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: This is Mr. Kallenbach. He is our chief
carpenter – and also our chief benefactor. He has made this experiment
possible.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Well, it’s quite a place, your “ashram” – is
that right?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: That’s right. The word only means
“community.” But it could stand for “village”… or the world.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You’re an ambitious man.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: They tell me you also take your turn at
peeling potatoes and cleaning the “outhouse” – is that part of the
experiment?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Ba – we will need another place set for
Mr. Walker’s driver.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: I will tell Sora.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It’s one way to learn that each man’s labor
is as important as another’s. In fact when you’re doing it, “cleaning
the outhouse” seems far more important than the law.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Please come and join us – you’ll need
something before your journey back. Excuse me a moment.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Sora was sent to tell me I – I must rake and
cover the latrine.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Everyone takes his turn.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: It is the work of untouchables.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: In this place there are no untouchables –
and no work is beneath any of us!</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: I am your wife.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: All the more reason.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: As you command.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: The others may follow you – but you forget, I
knew you when you were a boy!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It’s not me. It’s the principle. And you
will do it with joy or not do it at all!</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Not at all then…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: All right, go! You don’t belong here! Go!
Leave the ashram! Get out altogether! We don’t want you!</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Have you no shame? I’m your wife… Where do you
expect me to go?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: What is the matter with me…?</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: You are human – only human.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: And it is even harder for those of us who do not
even want to be as good as you do.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I apologize…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I must go back to that reporter.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: …And I must rake and cover the latrine.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I want to welcome you all!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Every one of you. We – have – no –
secrets.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Let us begin by being clear about General
Smuts’s new law. All Indians must now be fingerprinted – like criminals.
Men and women. No marriage other than a Christian marriage is considered
valid. Under this Act our wives and mothers are whores… And every man
here a bastard.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: He’s become quite good at this.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And a policeman passing an Indian dwelling –
I will not call them homes – may enter and demand the card or any Indian
woman whose dwelling it is.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: God damn them!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Understand! He does not have to stand at the
door – he may enter.</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: I swear to Allah I will kill the man who
offers that insult to my home and my wife! And let them hang me!</p>
<p><strong>tyeb mohammed</strong>: I say talk means nothing. Kill a few
officials before they disgrace one Indian woman – then they might think
twice about such laws!</p>
<p><strong>tyeb mohammed’s friend</strong>: In that cause, I would be
willing to die!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I praise such courage. I need such courage –
because in this cause, I too am prepared to die… But, my friend, there
is no cause for which I am prepared to kill.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have asked you here tonight because
despite all their troops and police, I think there is a way to defeat
this law. Whatever they do to us we will attack no one, kill no one… But
we will not give our fingerprints – not one of us.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: They will imprison us, they will fine us.
They will seize our possessions. But they cannot take away our
self-respect if we do not give it to them.</p>
<p><strong>voice from the gallery</strong>: Have you been to prison?
They’ll beat us and torture us! I say –</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am asking you to fight – ! To fight
against their anger – not to provoke it!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We will not strike a blow – but we will
receive them. And through our pain we will make them see their injustice
and it will hurt, as all fighting hurts! …But we cannot lose. We cannot.
Because they may torture my body, may break my bones, even kill me… They
will then have my dead body – not my obedience.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We are Hindu and Muslim – children of God,
each of us. Let us take a solemn oath in His name that – come what may –
we will not submit to this law.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: God save our gracious King… Long live our
…noble King. God save the King!!</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: These men are contracted laborers. They
belong in the mines.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You have put their comrades in jail. When
you free them they will go back to work.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: I’ve warned you.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We have warned each other.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: I don’t think that is very good.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: At the canter – for-ward!</p>
<p><strong>miner</strong>: We should lie down – the horses won’t tramp
on us. Down! Down! Everyone lie down!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Lie down! Lie down!</p>
<p><strong>miner</strong>: The horses have more mercy than the men.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You’re right!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Lie down! Lie down!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Follow me!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What the hell are we supposed to do
now?</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: Let them march… In our own sweet time, in
our own sweet way – we’ll get them.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has at last been put into prison.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: But I would ask you – assembled here in
this house of God – to recognize that we are witnessing something new,
something so unexpected, so unusual that it is not surprising the
Government is at a loss. What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do is ask
questions about ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: As Christians, those are difficult
questions to answer. How do we treat men who defy an unjust law – men
who will not fight, but will not comply?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: They’re sparing no one, I see.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: No. You were the surprise. It’s been all over
the prison. We thought they’d be too afraid of the English press.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: So did I.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: Don’t worry about the meat – it’s Hindu –
there’s not a trace.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: I don’t know who they’ve left out there to do
the work. There can’t be one mine left open. Have they touched the
women?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: My wife publicly defied the law. They’ve
arrested her and four others.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: The fools! Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It’s split the Government.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: Well, that’s one victory.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If we hold firm, it won’t be the last.</p>
<p><strong>khan</strong>: Don’t worry – I’ve never seen men so
determined. You’ve given them a way to fight… And I don’t think –</p>
<p><strong>prison officer</strong>: Gandhi! I want Gandhi! Which sammy
is it?</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Ah, Mr. Gandhi. I thought we might have a
little talk.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Will you have a glass of sherry?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Thank you. No.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Perhaps some tea?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I dined at the prison.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Ahh.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Please – please do come and sit down. It’s
prison I wanted to talk to you about.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Mr. Gandhi, I’ve more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such “exception” to.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I’m sure it
will be done.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Hm. Of course it is not quite that
simple.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Somehow I expected not.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: I’m glad to hear you say that… very glad. You
see if we repeal the Act under pressure under this kind of pressure it
will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Good. Good. I have thought of calling for a
Royal Commission to “investigate” the new legislation. I think I could
guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I congratulate them.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: But they might also recommend that future
Indian immigration be severely restricted – even stopped.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Immigration was not an issue on which we
fought. It would be wrong of us to make it one now that we – we are in a
position of advantage.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: You’re an extraordinary man.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at
this moment.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: I’m ordering the release of all prisoners
within the next twenty- four hours. You yourself are free from this
moment.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Assuming we are in agreement?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Yes – yes. It’s just that… in these clothes
I’d – I’d prefer to go by taxi.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: All right. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m – I’m afraid I have no money.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Oh! Neither have I. I’m awfully sorry.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: Daniels, would you lend Mr. Gandhi a shilling
for a taxi?</p>
<p><strong>daniels</strong>: I beg your pardon, sir?</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: How far will you be going, Mr. Gandhi?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Well – now that this is settled – I had
thought seriously of going back to India but a shilling will do
splendidly for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Thank you. Thank you both for a very
enlightening experience.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m obliged, Mr. Daniels, but I will find my
own way out.</p>
<p><strong>smuts</strong>: He’s either a great man or a colossal fraud…
Either way, I shall be glad to see the last of him.</p>
<p><strong>young englishman</strong>: By God, he loves it…</p>
<p><strong>second englishman</strong>: I’m sure he hates it.</p>
<p><strong>second englishman</strong>: Generals’ reputations are being
made in France today, fighting on the Western Front. Not as Military
Governors in India.</p>
<p><strong>second englishman</strong>: What the devil’s going on back
there?</p>
<p><strong>young englishman</strong>: It must be that Indian that made
all that fuss back in Africa. My cabin boy told me he was on board.</p>
<p><strong>second englishman</strong>: Why haven’t we seen him?
Gandhi?</p>
<p><strong>young englishman</strong>: Yes. That’s it. He was traveling
Third Class. There he is.</p>
<p><strong>second englishman’s voice-over</strong>: God – he’s dressed
like a coolie! I thought he was a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>young englishman</strong>: After he came out of jail he
refused to wear European clothes.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No, no, I haven’t “refused”… I – I simply
wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dressed.</p>
<p><strong>english journalist</strong>: Will you support the war effort,
Mr. Gandhi?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I – I have demanded rights as a British
citizen, it is therefore my duty to help in the defense of the British
Empire.</p>
<p><strong>american reporter</strong>: What are you going to do now that
you’re back in India?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I don’t know… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>second indian reporter</strong>: As an Indian woman how could
you accept the indignity of prison?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Please, Mr. Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: My dignity comes from following my husband.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Just a few words – then we’ll get you to
civilization.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I – I am glad to be home. I – I thank you
for your greeting.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: We’ll follow with your wife – don’t worry,
everything’s arranged.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Who is that young man?</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: That’s young Nehru. He’s got his father’s
intellect, his mother’s looks and the devil’s charm. If they don’t ruin
him at Cambridge – Wave! Wave! – he may amount to something.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling
lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I’d be greeting you as a national
hero.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m hardly that, Mr. Patel.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Oh, yes, you are. It’s been two hundred years
since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away
with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you’re not a junior clerk
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: The new Military Governor of the North West
Province was on that ship. Too bad you came back Third Class – he might
have been impressed by a successful barrister who had outmaneuvered
General Smuts.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Yes… I’m sure…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nehru</strong>: No, I leave practical matters to my
husband and revolution to my son…</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Mr. Jinnah, our joint host, member of
Congress, and the leader of the Muslim League and Mr. Prakash, who I
fear is awaiting trial for sedition and inducement to murder.</p>
<p><strong>prakash</strong>: I have not actually pulled a trigger,
Mr. Gandhi, I have simply written that if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law, then it is an Indian’s duty to kill an
Englishman for enforcing his law in a land that is not his.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It is a clever argument; I am not sure it
will produce the end you desire.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: We hope you intend to join us in the
struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: May I? Mohan – I would like you to meet
someone.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: He told the press he would support the
British in the war.</p>
<p><strong>prakash</strong>: That’s non-violence for you.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Is he a fool?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I’m not certain… But I wouldn’t be
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I lied to you, Mohan, when I told you I
decided to come to South Africa to meet you. Professor Gokhale sent
me.</p>
<p><strong>gokhale</strong>: We’re trying to make a nation, Gandhi – and
the British keep trying to break us up into religions and principalities
and “provinces.” What you were writing in South Africa – that’s what we
need here.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have much to learn about India. And I have
to begin my practice again – one needs money to run a journal.</p>
<p><strong>gokhale</strong>: Nonsense. Go on, Charlie. This is Indian
talk – we want none of you imperialists.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right – I’ll go and write my report to
the Viceroy.</p>
<p><strong>gokhale</strong>: Go and find a pretty Hindu woman and
convert her to Christianity – that’s as much mischief as you’re
allowed.</p>
<p><strong>gokhale</strong>: Forget your practice. India has many men
with too much wealth – it is their privilege to nourish the efforts of
the few who can raise India from servitude and apathy. I will see to it
– you begin your journal.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have little to say. India is an “alien”
country to me.</p>
<p><strong>gokhale</strong>: Well, change that. Go and find India. Not
what you see here, but the real India. You’ll see what needs to be said.
What we need to hear.</p>
<p><strong>gokhale</strong>: When I saw you in that tunic I knew… I knew
I could die in peace. Make India proud of herself.</p>
<p><strong>troop leader</strong>: Clear the way! Get out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I ask you to pray for those who died. For
the English soldiers… who were doing what they thought was right. And
for the brave terrorists whose patriotism led them to do what was
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It is not my law, it is the law of creation.
We reap what we sow. Out there in the fields – and in our hearts.
Violence sows hatred, and the will to revenge. In them. And in us.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: I agree with Jinnah. Now that the Americans
are in, the war will end soon. The Germans are worn out as it is… and
our first act should be to convene a Congress Party convention and
demand independence.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: And we must speak with one voice –
united.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Ah – we should invite Gandhi. What the devil
has happened to him anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: He’s “discovering” India.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Which is a lot better than causing trouble
where it matters. Invite him – let him say his piece about South Africa
– and then let him slip into oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Please! You’re being foolish!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: There’s no room! And the air is lovely.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No violence, please.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Let me hang on with two hands or I will
fall.</p>
<p><strong>indian</strong>: Englishman Sahib!</p>
<p><strong>indian</strong>: Come! Come! There is room!</p>
<p><strong>first indian</strong>: Place the foot on the window.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Going nearer to God!</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Charlie! Be careful!!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mohan – !!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Let go! You’ll kill him!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Let go! Let go!</p>
<p><strong>first indian</strong>: You see – most comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Please, God, no!</p>
<p><strong>second indian</strong>: Are you Christian, Sahib?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes, yes, I’m a Christian.</p>
<p><strong>second indian</strong>: I know a Christian. She drinks
blood.</p>
<p><strong>second indian</strong>: The blood of Christ – every
Sunday!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi’s voice</strong>: Charlie!!</p>
<p><strong>first indian</strong>: It’s all right, Sahib! Very safe –
bend – bend!</p>
<p><strong>indian’s voice</strong>: Pray to God, Sahib! Now is when it
is best to be Hindu!</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: We were asked for toleration. We were asked
for patience. Some gave it and some did not. Well, their war is over!
And those of us who supported it, and those of us who refused must
forget our differences!</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: And there can be no excuses from the British
now! India wants Home Rule! India demands Home Rule!!</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: And let no one question that Mr. Jinnah
speaks not just for the Muslims – but for all India!</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: And now I’m going to introduce to you a man
whose writings we are all becoming familiar with… a man who stood high
in the esteem of our beloved Professor Gokhale… a man whose
accomplishment in South Africa will always be remembered. Mr. Mohandas
Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Your journal has made a great impact.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am flattered by Mr. Patel I would be even
more flattered if what he said were true.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: But it’s true! I – I read it… often.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Since I returned from South Africa, I have
traveled over much of India. And I know I could travel many more years
and still only see a small part of it.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: …and yet already I know what we say here
means nothing to the masses of our country.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Here we make speeches for each other – and
those English liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: But the people of India are untouched. Their
politics are confined to bread and salt.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Illiterate they may be, but they are not
blind. They see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men
who simply want to take over the role of the British in the name of
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: This Congress tells the world it represents
India. My brothers, India is seven hundred thousand “villages” not a few
hundred lawyers in Delhi and Bombay. Until we stand in the fields with
the millions who toil each day under the hot sun, we will not represent
India – nor will we ever be able to challenge the British as one
nation.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Have you read his magazine?</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: No – but I think I’m going to.</p>
<p><strong>first friend</strong>: This can’t be the way!</p>
<p><strong>second friend</strong>: Yes, I’m sure this is the direction
India is taking.</p>
<p><strong>second friend</strong>: To think I almost got excited by
Mr. Jinnah when all this was awaiting me.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: We’re looking for Mr. Gandhi!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ah, you’ll find him under the tree by the
river. You’d better leave the car – the ground is rather soft.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Thank you . . .</p>
<p><strong>first friend</strong>: Come on! I’m anxious to meet this new
“force”!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I try to live like an Indian, as you see… it
is stupid of course, because in our country it is the British who decide
how an Indian lives – what he may buy, what he may sell. And from their
luxury in the midst of our terrible poverty they instruct us on what is
justice and what is sedition. So it is only natural that our best young
minds assume an air of Eastern dignity, while greedily assimilating
every Western weakness as quickly as they can acquire it.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: If we have Home Rule that will change.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Would you, please?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And why should the English grant us Home
Rule? Here, we must take the peelings to the goats.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We only make wild speeches, or perform even
wilder acts of terrorism. We’ve bred an army of anarchists but not one
single group that can really fight the British anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I thought you were against fighting.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Just spread it around – they like the new
peelings mixed with the rotting ones.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Where there is injustice, I’ve always
believed in fighting. The question is do you fight to change things, or
do you fight to punish. For myself, I have found that we are all such
sinners we should leave punishment to God. And if we really want to
change things there are better ways of doing it than by derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: The fire is ready.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You see, even here we live under
tyranny.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I told you…</p>
<p><strong>first friend</strong>: Hm… but look at him. Some “fighter”! I
can see the British shaking now.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: But it’s the ink that is the most diffic –</p>
<p><strong>shukla</strong>: I am looking for Mr. Gandhi…</p>
<p><strong>shukla</strong>: …I’ve wanted to speak to you for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>shukla</strong>: …our crops… we can’t sell them… We have no
money… but the landlords take the same rent.</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Clear the way there! Get out of the
way!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant putnam</strong>: Sir! Up here!</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Give me a leg up, will you!</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: What the hell is it, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Jesus…!</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant putnam</strong>: I don’t know, sir. The agent says
they got a telegram and it just said, he is coming… and gave the time of
the train.</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Who the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant putnam</strong>: I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Who the devil are you?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Well, whoever you are, we don’t
want you here. I suggest you get back on that train before it leaves the
station.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: They seem to want me.</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Now look here. I’ll put you under
arrest if you’d prefer?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: On what charge?</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: I don’t want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am an Indian traveling in my own country.
I see no reason for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>english captain</strong>: Well, there’d better not be.</p>
<p><strong>meha</strong>: For years the landlords have ordered us to
grow indigo, for dyeing the cloth. Always they took part of the crop as
rent.</p>
<p><strong>meha</strong>: But now the English factories make cloth for
everyone. No one wants our indigo. And the landlords won’t take their
share. They say we must pay our rent in cash.</p>
<p><strong>meha</strong>: What we could, we sold… The police have taken
the rest. There is no food, we –</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I understand. The landlords are British?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: What we can do… we will try to do.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Is all Champaran like this, Shukla?</p>
<p><strong>shukla</strong>: Yes, Bapu… The whole province… hundreds –
thousands.</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: Mohan – !</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Are you Mr. M. K. Gandhi?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: I’m sorry but you are under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am not sorry at all.</p>
<p><strong>batsman</strong>: Who did you say would be buying the
drinks?</p>
<p><strong>batsman</strong>: Oh, no –</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: …I’ve got no idea. All I know is there’s a
riot or something at Motihari in Champaran, and the whole company is
ordered out.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: It’s two days’ march!</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: That’s why the match is off. It’s mostly
Muslim territory and the old man’s taking no chances.</p>
<p><strong>batsman</strong>: God, and it’s the best innings I’ve had
since Oxford.</p>
<p><strong>wicket keeper</strong>: India’s full of grief, old man.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I wish to see the prisoner, please.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: All right, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Charlie–</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Shades of South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not quite. They’re only “holding me” until
the Magistrate’s hearing. Then it will be prison.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did they take your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: These are my clothes now.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You always had a puritanical streak,
Mohan.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If I want to be one with them, I have to
live like them.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think you do. But I thank God we all
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m sure your legs are quite as handsome as
mine.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way.
I’m far too modest for such a display.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Couldn’t I be let in with the prisoner? I
am a clergyman.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: They’re calling you “Bapu.” I thought it
meant father.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It does. We must be getting old,
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I think, Charlie, that you can help us most
by taking that assignment you’ve been offered in Fiji.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have to be sure – they have to be sure –
that what we do can be done by Indians… alone.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: But you know the strategy. The world is full
of people who will despise what’s happening here. It is their strength
we need. Before you go, you could start us in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I must leave from Calcutta, and soon.
You’ll have to say goodbye to Ba for me.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: When I get the chance.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.
Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart…</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: I am going to clear the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m not sure we’d be able to. And it is a
first hearing, it’s supposed to be public. And he’s a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: I don’t know where they found the nerve
for all this.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sure I don’t either, but the troops won’t
be here until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: How the press get here before the
military?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: That English clergyman sent a number of
telegrams yesterday afternoon. I understand one of them even went to the
Viceroy.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: You have been ordered out of the
province on the grounds of disturbing the peace.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: With respect, I refuse to go.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Do you want to go to jail?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: All right. I will release you on bail of
one hundred rupees until I reach a sentence.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I refuse to pay one hundred rupees.</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: Then I – I will grant release without
bail – until I reach a decision.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Gandhiji! – Gandhiji! Mr. Gandhi!</p>
<p><strong>first young man</strong>: Gandhiji – we are from Bihar. We
received a cable this morning from an old friend who was at Cambridge
with us. His name is Nehru and I believe you know him.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>first young man</strong>: He tells us you need help. And we
have come to give it.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I want to document, coldly, rationally, what
is being done here. It may take months – many, many months.</p>
<p><strong>first young man</strong>: We have no pressing
engagements.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You will have to live with the peasants. I
have nothing to pay you. Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>sir george</strong>: I don’t know what this country is coming
to!</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: But good God, man, you yourself raised
the rent simply to finance a hunting expedition!</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: And some of these others – beatings,
illegal seizures, demanding services without pay, even refusing them
water! In India!…</p>
<p><strong>sir george</strong>: Nobody knows what it is to try to get
these people to work!</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: Well, you’ve make this half-naked
whatever-he-is into an international hero.</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: “One lone man marching dusty roads armed
only with honesty and a bamboo shaft doing battle with the British
Empire.” At home children are writing “essays” about him.</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: I couldn’t take another two years of him
to save my life.</p>
<p><strong>sir george</strong>: What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>personal secretary</strong>: A rebate on rents paid. They are
to be free to grow crops of their own choice. A commission – part Indian
– to hear grievances.</p>
<p><strong>sir george</strong>: That would satisfy him?…</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: And His Majesty’s Government. It only
needs your signature for the landlords.</p>
<p><strong>sir george</strong>: It will be worth it to see the back of
him. We’re too damn liberal.</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: Perhaps. But at least all this has made
the Government see some sense about what men like Mr. Gandhi should be
allowed, and what they should be denied.</p>
<p><strong>sir edward</strong>: Things are going to change.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Where is Mr. Gandhi?</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: He said he preferred to walk, sir. I
followed him most of the way. He’s just turned the corner.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: The Prophet give me patience.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: He came Third Class.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: My house is honored.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: The honor is ours. May I introduce
Mr. Kallenbach. He’s an old friend and his interest is in flowers. I
presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: I’ll send my gardener. I’m sure you’ll have
much to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Gentlemen – the hero of Champaran.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Only the stubborn man of Champaran.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Mr. Patel you know. Mr. Maulana Azad – a
fellow Muslim… recently released from prison.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Mr. Kripalani. And of course you know
Mr. Nehru.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: has been admitted to the power circle, he</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Your writings are specifically listed.</p>
<p><strong>kripalani</strong>: So much for helping them in the Great
War…</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: There is only one answer to that. Direct
action – on a scale they can never handle!</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Terrorism would only justify their
repression. And what kinds of leaders would it throw up? Are they likely
to be the men we would want at the head of our country?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I’ve been catching up on my reading.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: I too have read Mr. Gandhi’s writings, but
I’d rather be ruled by an Indian terrorist than an English one. And I
don’t want to submit to that kind of law.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: diplomatically – but with a trace of</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If I may – I, for one, have never advocated
passive anything.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am with Mr. Jinnah. We must never submit
to such laws – ever. And I think our resistance must be active and
provocative.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I want to embarrass all those who wish to
treat us as slaves. All of them.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Forgive my stupid illustration. But I want
to change their minds – not kill them for weaknesses we all possess.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: And what “resistance” would you offer?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: The law is due to take effect from April
sixth. I want to call on the nation to make that a day of prayer and
fasting.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: You mean a general strike?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of
course no work could be done – no buses, no trains, no factories, no
administration. The country would stop.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: My God, it would terrify them…</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: Three hundred fifty million people at prayer.
Even the English newspapers would have to report that. And explain
why.</p>
<p><strong>kripalani</strong>: But could we get people to do it?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Champaran stirred the whole country. They are
calling you Mahatma – the Great Soul.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Fortunately such news comes very slowly
where I live.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I think if we all worked to publicize it… all
of the Congress… every avenue we know.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Perhaps I should have stayed in the garden
and talked about the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong>: Sir – it’s Mr. Kinnoch.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kinnoch</strong>: Nothing… nothing is working, sir – buses…
trains… the markets… There’s not even any civilian staff here, sir…
Everything has stopped.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?</p>
<p><strong>kinnoch</strong>: No, sir – Karachi, Calcutta, Madras,
Bangalore. It’s, it’s total.</p>
<p><strong>kinnoch</strong>: The Army had to take over the telegraph or
we’d be cut off from the world.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: I can’t believe it…</p>
<p><strong>kinnoch</strong>: He’s going to sell his own paper tomorrow
in Bombay. They’ve called for a parade – on Victoria Road.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Arrest him!</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You too…</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: It seems less formal than “Mahatma.”</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Since your arrest the riots have hardly
stopped. Not big –; but they keep breaking out. I run to stop them… and
Patel and Kripalani – they are never at rest. But some English civilians
have been killed, and the Army is attacking crowds with clubs – and
sometimes worse.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Maybe I’m wrong… maybe we’re not ready yet.
In South Africa the numbers were small…</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: The Government’s afraid, and they don’t know
what to do. But they’re more afraid of terrorists than of you. The
Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non-
violence.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’ve never spoken for anything else.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: …England is so powerful – its army and its
navy, all its modern weapons – but when a great power like that strikes
defenseless people it shows it brutality, its own weakness! Especially
when those people do not strike back. That is why the Mahatma begs us to
take the course of non-violence!</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: …If we riot, if we fight back, we become
the vandals and they become the law! If we bear their blows, they are
the vandals – God and His law are on our… side.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: …We must have the courage to take their
anger…</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: Port arms, Sergeant Major.</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: Load.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: …Our pain will be our victory.</p>
<p><strong>adc</strong>: Do we issue a warning, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: They’ve had their warning – no meetings.</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: Sergeant Major –</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Take aim!</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant major</strong>: Reload!</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: Take your time. Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: Corporal!</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>advocate</strong>: General Dyer, is it correct that you
ordered your troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowd?</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: That is so.</p>
<p><strong>advocate</strong>: One thousand five hundred and sixteen
casualties with one thousand six hundred and fifty bullets.</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: My intention was to inflict a lesson that
would have an impact throughout all India.</p>
<p><strong>indian barrister</strong>: General, had you been able to take
in the armored car, would you have opened fire with the machine gun?</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: I think, probably – yes.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: General, did you realize there were children
– and women – in the crowd?</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>advocate</strong>: But that was irrelevant to the point you
were making?</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>advocate</strong>: Could I ask you what provision you made
for the wounded?</p>
<p><strong>dyer</strong>: I was ready to help any who applied.</p>
<p><strong>advocate</strong>: General… how does a child shot with a
3-0-3 Enfield “apply” for help?</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: You must understand, gentlemen, that His
Majesty’s Government – and the British people – repudiate both the
massacre and the philosophy that prompted it.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: What I would like to do is to come to
some compromise over the new civil legis –</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If you will excuse me, Your Excellency, it
is our view that matters have gone beyond “legislation.”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We think it is time you recognized that you
are masters in someone else’s home. Despite the best intentions of the
best of you, you must, in the nature of things, humiliate us to control
us. General Dyer is but an extreme example of the principle. It is time
you left.</p>
<p><strong>kinnoch</strong>: With respect, Mr. Gandhi, without British
administration, this country would be reduced to chaos.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Mr. Kinnoch, I beg you to accept that there
is no people on earth who would not prefer their own bad government to
the “good” government of an alien power.</p>
<p><strong>brigadier</strong>: My dear sir – India is British! We’re
hardly an alien power!</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Even if His Majesty could waive all
other considerations, he has a duty to the millions of his Muslim
subjects who are a minority in this realm. And experience has taught
that his troops and his administration are essential in order to keep
the peace.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: All nations contain religious minorities.
Like other countries, ours will have its problems. But they will be ours
– not yours.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: And how do you propose to make them yours?
You don’t think we’re just going to walk out of India.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Yes… in the end you will walk out. Because
one hundred thousand Englishmen simply cannot control three hundred
fifty million Indians if the Indians refuse to co-operate. And that is
what we intend to achieve – peaceful, non-violent, non-co-
operation.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Until you yourself see the wisdom of
leaving… your Excellency.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: “You don’t just expect us to walk out?”
“Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>brigadier</strong>: Extraordinary little man! “Nonviolent,
non-co-operation” – for a moment I almost thought they were actually
going to do something.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Yes – but it would be wise to be very
cautious for a time. The Anti- Terrorist Act will remain on the
statutes, but on no account is Gandhi to be arrested. Whatever mischief
he causes, I have no intention of making a martyr of him.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: …but now something worse is happening. When
Gandhiji and I were growing up, women wove their own cloth. But now
there are millions who have no work because those who can buy all they
need from England. I say with Gandhiji, there is no beauty in the finest
cloth if it makes hunger and unhappiness.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: My message tonight is the message I have
given to your brothers everywhere. To gain independence we must prove
worthy of it.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: There must be Hindu-Muslim unity – always.
Secondly, no Indian must be treated as the English treat us so we must
remove untouchability from our lives, and from our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Third – we must defy the British.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not with violence that will inflame their
will, but with firmness that will open their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: English factories make the cloth – that
makes our poverty. All those who wish to make the English see, bring me
the cloth from Manchester and Leeds that you wear tonight, and we will
light a fire that will be seen in Delhi – and London!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And if, like me, you are left with only one
piece of homespun – wear it with dignity!</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Excuse me – just let me get out of your way,
please. No, thank you, I’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Ah, Herman! No, no – don’t destroy my good
intentions. I’m feeling guilty about traveling Second Class.</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: I do it as a friend – and admirer – not
a servant.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Ah, in that case!</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Maulana is made of sterner stuff. Our trains
met in Bombay, but he’s back there in that lot somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>patel’s voice-over</strong>: There he is – out Gandhi-ing
Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: When I think what our “beloved Mahatma” asks,
I don’t know how he ever got such a hold over us. Is he back?</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: Yes. Now that things are moving he’s
going to write and only take part when it’s necessary.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: It was a Hindu child and it tried to wet on
me.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Of course. A Muslim beef eater – I’m only
surprised he missed.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: He was a she.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Ah, that explains it. Well, do I carry your
luggage as penance or –</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: There’s another passenger – a Miss
Slade. She’s the daughter of an English admiral. She’s been
corresponding with him for a year.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: And what does the daughter of an English
admiral propose to do in an ashram – sink us?</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: From the looks of the luggage, yes.</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: She wants to make her home with us – and
Gandhiji has agreed.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: You’d be Mr. Kallenbach.</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: …And you would be Miss Slade.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: I prefer the name Gandhiji has given me –
Mirabehn.</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: It was a gift and it only worked a few
weeks, but when Gandhi came home he struck on this idea. He calls it his
ox-Ford. Comfortable – and yet more our pace.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: Might Mr. Nehru be there too?</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: The irresponsible young Nehru is in prison –
again. Though there is a rumor that under pressure from your country,
they will let him out – again.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: You can’t know how closely we follow your
struggle – how many in England admired what you did in Bardoli. It must
have taken enormous courage.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Well, in this country one must decide if one
is more afraid of the government or Gandhi. For us, it’s Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: And you’re German…</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: And do you feel Indian?</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: But you’ve been with him so long –
why?</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: …I’d come to believe I would never meet
a truly honest man. And then I met one.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Stop – stop…</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: God gave you ten thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Sardar…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: What you’ve done is a miracle. You have made
all India proud.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: It must have been the only Non-violent
campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not true! The secret is mastering the
urge.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: He came Second Class.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Well, we can’t expect miracles all the time.
Your news I understand is not so good.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Come, come – you will be my daughter…</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: …but then some rioting broke out between
Hindus and Muslims – violent, terrible…</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: Whether it was provoked… But it gave them an
excuse to impose martial law throughout Bengal. Some of the things the
military have done…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Is the campaign weakening?</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: The marches and protests are bigger if
anything but with the censorship here they know more in England than we
do, and it saps the courage to think you may be suffering alone.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: They are not alone. And martial law only
shows how desperate the British are.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Is that homespun? Or cotton from Leeds?</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: I – I sent for it, from here. I dyed it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: What do the workers in England make of what
we’re doing? It must have produced hardship.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: It has. But you’d be surprised. They
understand – they really do. It’s not the workers you have to worry
about.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Good. Ba will have to teach you to spin
too.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: I would rather march.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: First spin. Let the others march for a
time.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: First lesson: To march, wear shoes, to spin, do
not.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: I’ll teach you all our foolishness, and you must
teach me yours.</p>
<p><strong>marchers</strong>: Home Rule! Long live Gandhi! Buy Indian!
Long live Gandhi!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: I’ll stuff your damn mouth with it!</p>
<p><strong>second marcher</strong>: Leave him alone – he wasn’t harming
you!</p>
<p><strong>tail-enders</strong>: Help! Help us! as they try to scramble
away from the attack. Out of shot we can still hear the disappearing
chant: “Home Rule! Long live Gandhi!”</p>
<p><strong>tail-ender</strong>: Help! Help us!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hey –</p>
<p><strong>patel’s voice</strong>: That’s one bit of news they haven’t
censored.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah’s voice</strong>: Oh, it’s all over the world… India’s
“non-violence.”</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: We must end the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: After what they did at the massacre – it’s
only an eye for an eye.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: An eye for an eye only ends up making the
whole world blind. We must stop.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Gandhiji – do you know the sacrifices people
have made?</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: We would never get the same commitment again
– ever.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If we obtain our freedom by murder and
bloodshed I want no part of it.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: It was one incident.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Tell that to the families of the policemen
who died.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu – the whole nation is marching. They
wouldn’t stop, even if we asked them to.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I will ask. And I will fast as penance for
my part in arousing such emotions – and I will not stop until they
stop.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: God! You can be sure the British won’t
censor that! They’ll put it on every street corner.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: But – but Gandhiji people are aroused… they
won’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If I die, perhaps they will…</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: I must get ready for evening prayers. Mirabehn
is here.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: I’ve brought your drinking water. May I
turn you?</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: There is a little lemon juice in it. That
is all.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru –
there was a telegram. Almost everywhere it has stopped.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: When it is everywhere, then my prayers will
be answered.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Do you find me stubborn?</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: I don’t know… I know you are right. I
don’t know that this is right.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: When I despair, I remember that all through
history the way of truth and love has always won.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: There have been tyrants and murderers, and
for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall.
Think of it – always… When you are in doubt that that is God’s way, the
way the world is meant to be… think of that.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And then – try to do it His way. And now –
could I have another feast of lemon juice?</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: Panditji – come in.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Jinnah, Patel, all of Congress has called for
the end of non-co- operation. There’s not been one demonstration. All
over India people are praying that you will end the fast. They’re
walking in the streets, offering garlands to the police – and to British
soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Perhaps – perhaps I have overdone it.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Good morning, Bapu!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Good morning. Don’t let her go. If she bumps
me I am done for.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Don’t worry. I milk her every day, she’s
not –</p>
<p><strong>police superintendent</strong>: Sedition.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: You can’t be serious! This man has just
stopped a revolution!</p>
<p><strong>police superintendent</strong>: That’s as may be. I only know
what I am charged to perform.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I don’t believe it – even the British can’t
be that stupid!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Panditji – please, help me.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You must help Herman – and Ba. I have been
on many trips – it is just another trip.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am at your command.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If there is one protest – one riot – a
disgrace of any kind, I will fast again.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Gandhi to Nehru,</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Call the prisoner to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>advocate general</strong>: …“Non-co-operation has one aim:
the overthrow of the Government. Sedition must become our creed. We must
give no quarter, nor can we expect any.” Signed M. K. Gandhi, in your
journal Young India, dated twenty-second March of this year. Do you deny
writing it?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not at all. And I will save the Court’s
time, M’Lord, by stating under oath that to this day I believe
non-co-operation with evil is a duty. And that British rule of India is
evil.</p>
<p><strong>advocate general</strong>: The Prosecution rests, M’Lord.</p>
<p><strong>judge broomfield</strong>: I take it you will conduct your
own defense, Mr. Gandhi.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have no defense, My Lord. I am guilty as
charged. And if you truly believe in the system of law you administer in
my country, you must inflict on me the severest penalty possible.</p>
<p><strong>judge broomfield</strong>: It is impossible for me to ignore
that you are in a different category from any person I have ever tried,
or am likely to try.</p>
<p><strong>judge broomfield</strong>: It is nevertheless my duty to
sentence you – to six years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong>judge broomfield</strong>: If however His Majesty’s
Government could – at some later date – see fit to reduce that term, no
one would be better pleased than I.</p>
<p><strong>collins’ voice-over</strong>: Yes, I’m sure that’s exactly
what they hoped. Put him in prison a few years and with luck he’d be
forgotten. And maybe they’d even subdue him…</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Well, he certainly wasn’t forgotten! And as
soon as he got out he was back tramping the country, preaching
non-violence and demanding a free India. Everybody knows another
showdown’s coming – but when, and over what –</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Well, I read you account of that crowd in
Calcutta and that he was twisting the Lion’s tail again…</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: …and I knew something had to give. And I was
determined to be here when it did.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: How does a reporter in Central America
learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Oh, I’ve been a Gandhi buff for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: He certainly makes good copy. The other day
Winston Churchill called him “that half-naked Indian fakir.”</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: I met him once.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: You mean Gandhi?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Back in South Africa… long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: What was he like?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Lots of hair… and a little like a college
freshman – trying to figure everything out.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: Well, he must’ve found some of the
answers…</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: “In every worthy wish of yours, I shall be your
helpmate.”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: “Take a fourth step, that we may be ever
full of joy.”</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: “I will ever live devoted to you, speaking words
of love and praying for your happiness.”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: “Take a fifth step, that we may serve the
people.”</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: “I will follow close behind you and help to
serve the people.”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: “Take a sixth step, that we may follow our
vows in life.”</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: “I will follow you in all our vows and
duties.”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: “Take the seventh step, that we may ever
live as friends.”</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: “You are my best friend… my highest guru, and my
sovereign lord.”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Then I put a sweetened wheat cake in her
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: And I put a sweetened wheat cake in his
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And with that we were pronounced man and
wife. We were both thirteen…</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Even as a boy I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Trying to keep track of you is making me
change all my sleeping habits.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And you’ve come all this way because you
think something is going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Hm. Is it?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Perhaps. I’ve come here to think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Do you remember much of South Africa?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: A great deal.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’ve traveled so far – and thought so much.
As you can see, my city was a sea city – always filled with Hindus and
Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians. The temple where you were
yesterday is of my family’s sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course
but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book
was read as long as God was worshipped.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: When I was a boy I used to sing a song in
that temple: “A true disciple knows another’s woes as his own. He bows
to all and despises none… Earthly possessions hold him not.” Like all
boys I said the words, not thinking of what they meant or how they might
be influencing me. I’ve traveled so far… and all I’ve done is come back
home.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: You know what you’re going to do.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It would have been very uncivil of me to let
you make such a long trip for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m going back to the ashram and then I’m
going to prove to the new Viceroy that the King’s writ no longer runs in
India!</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Salt?</p>
<p><strong>principal secretary</strong>: Yes, sir. He is going to march
to the sea and make salt.</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: There is a Royal Monopoly on
the manufacture of salt, sir. It’s illegal to make it or sell it without
a Government license.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: All right – he’s breaking the law. What will
he be depriving us of, two rupees of salt tax?</p>
<p><strong>principal secretary</strong>: It’s not a serious attack on
the revenue, sir. Its primary importance is symbolic.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Don’t patronize me, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>principal secretary</strong>: No, sir. I – in this climate,
sir, nothing lives without water – or salt. Our absolute control of it
is a control on the pulse of India.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: And that’s the basis of this “Declaration of
Independence”?</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: Yes, sir. The day he sets off
everyone is supposed to raise the flag of “Free India.” Then he walks
some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: I say ignore it. Let them raise their damn
flags, let him make his salt. It’s only symbolic if we choose to make it
so.</p>
<p><strong>principal secretary</strong>: He’s going to arrive at the sea
on the anniversary of the massacre at Amritsar.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: General Edgar is right – ignore it.
Mr. Gandhi will find it’s going to take a great deal more than a pinch
of salt to bring down the British Empire.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: …the real test will come if I am arrested.
If there is violence we lose all our moral advantage. This time it
mustn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: We’re not beginners anymore. We’ve been
trained by a strict sergeant major.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If I’m taken, Maulana is to lead the march.
If he is arrested, Patel, then Kripalani, then yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: You should be relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m sure I’m fit for at least five hundred
miles.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: You should ride the pony. It is not
necessary to walk to prove the point.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have two of them bossing me now.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: We must get these to the printer. I know it
will succeed. Even my mother is prepared to march.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And Jinnah?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: He’s waiting. He’s not prepared to accept it
will mean as much as you think.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Wait and see… wait and see…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You’ve done me a great service.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: on Gandhi’s words to</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Is it over if they arrest you now?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not if they arrest me – or a thousand – or
ten thousand. It is not only generals who know how to plan
campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: What if they don’t arrest you? What if they
don’t react at all?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Do you still have your notebook? The
function of a civil resister is to provoke response. And we will
continue to provoke until they respond, or they change the law. They are
not in control – we are. That is the strength of civil resistance.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: He said he’s in charge…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Are you going to walk all the way?</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report
it the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: “My name is Walk-er”…</p>
<p><strong>student leader</strong>: We’ve come to join the march. What
do we do?</p>
<p><strong>pyarelal</strong>: Be sure you’re awake in the morning. Find
a place to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi’s voice-over</strong>: Man needs salt as he needs air
and water. This salt comes from the Indian Ocean. Let every Indian claim
it as his right!!</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice-over</strong>: …and so once more the man of
non- violence has challenged the might of the British Empire.</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: They’re making it everywhere,
sir – mobs of them – publicly. Congress leaders are selling it on the
streets of Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>brigadier</strong>: We’re being made fools of around the
world!</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Isn’t there any instruction from
London?</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: We’re required to stop it. And stop it we
will. I don’t care if we fill the jails, stop it. Arrest anyone, any
rank – except Gandhi. We’ll cut his strength from under him. And then
we’ll deal with the Mahatma.</p>
<p><strong>british subaltern</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>subaltern</strong>: Right – jump to it – clear this
beach!</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: No violence, Zia!</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: …no violence.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You’re Nehru –</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I’m an illegal trader in salt.</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: …There’s been no time to keep
figures, but there must be ninety – a hundred thousand under arrest. And
it still goes on.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Who’s leading them?</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: I don’t know! Nehru, Patel,
almost every Congress Official is in jail… and their wives and their
children – we’ve even arrested Nehru’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>principal secretary</strong>: Has there been any
violence?</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: Oh, in Karachi the police
fired on a crowd and killed a couple of people and – and in Peshawar the
Deputy Police Commissioner lost his head and… and opened fire with a
machine gun. But he’s facing a disciplinary court! You can’t expect
things like that not to happen when –</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: I believe the question was intended to
discover if there was any violence of their side.</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: Oh, no, sir – no, I’m afraid
not.</p>
<p><strong>principal secretary</strong>: Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might –</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: He’s addressed this letter directly to you,
has he?</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: Yes, sir, he has. The usual –
India’s salt belongs to India – but then he says flatly that he
personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt
Works.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Thank him for his letter, and put him in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It will
be my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: And Fields, keep that salt works open.</p>
<p><strong>senior police officer</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: I would like admission to the Works.</p>
<p><strong>chief police officer</strong>: I am sorry, sir. That cannot
be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: Last night they took Gandhiji from us. They
expect us to lose heart or to fight back. We will not lose heart, we
will not fight back. In his name we will be beaten. As he has taught us,
we will not raise a hand. “Long live Mahatma Gandhi!”</p>
<p><strong>police commanding officer</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: Hello! Ed! Ed! Goddammit, don’t cut me off!
Ed! Okay – yeah – right.</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: “They walked, with heads up, without music,
or cheering, or any hope of escape from injury or death.” “It went on
and on and on. Women carried the wounded bodies from the ditch until
they dropped from exhaustion. But still it went on.”</p>
<p><strong>walker</strong>: “Whatever moral ascendance the West held was
lost today. India is free for she has taken all that steel and cruelty
can give, and she has neither cringed nor retreated.” “In the words of
his followers, ‘Long live Mahatma Gandhi.’”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am aware that I must have given you much
cause for irritation, your Excellency. I hope it will not stand between
us as men.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Mr. Gandhi, I have instructions to request
your attendance at an All- Government Conference in London to discuss –
to discuss the possible Independence of India.</p>
<p><strong>macdonald</strong>: I think our first duty is to recognize
that there is not one India, but several: a Hindu India, a Muslim India,
and India of Princely States. And all these must be respected – and
cared for – not just one.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Do I speak into that?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Are they ready? Do I start?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am glad to speak to America where so many
friends exist that I know only in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi’s voice</strong>: I think your interest and the
world’s has fallen on India, not only because we are struggling for
freedom, but because the way we are doing so is unique as far as history
shows us. Here in Europe mighty nations are, it seems, already
contemplating another war, though I think they, and all the world, are
sick to death of bloodspilling. All of us are seeking a way out, and I
flatter myself that perhaps the ancient land of India will offer such a
way. If we are to make progress we must not repeat history, but make
history. And I myself will die before I betray our belief that love is a
stronger weapon than hate.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It is only a sprain. Take her to the river,
and we’ll make a mud-pack for her. Go – I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: So the truth is, after all your travels, all
your efforts, they’ve stopped the campaign and sent you home
empty-handed.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: They are only clinging to old dreams and
trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone – Independence
will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when and how.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: I say when is now – and we will determine
how.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: They are preparing for war. I will not
support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: That’s when you take advantage.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No. That is just another way of striking
back. We have come a long way together with the British. When they leave
we want to see them off as friends. And now, if you’ll excuse me, there
is something I must attend to.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: “Mud packs.”</p>
<p><strong>british colonel</strong>: Mr. Gandhi – sir.</p>
<p><strong>british colonel</strong>: I have instructions to inquire as
to the subject of your speech tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: The value of goat’s milk in daily diet. But
you can be sure I will also speak against war.</p>
<p><strong>british colonel</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. That can’t be
allowed.</p>
<p><strong>adjutant</strong>: It’s all right, Mrs. Gandhi. I have orders
to return with you and your companion to the Mahatma’s ashram.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: If you take my husband, I intend to speak in his
place.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Stop! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: It was the Aga Khan’s palace, but
they’ve turned it into a prison.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: They’ve got most of the leading Congress
politicians in this one. But Nehru and some others are over in Dehra
Dun. Your timing’s pretty lucky. They had your Mr. Gandhi cut off from
the press but last month his personal secretary died and they’ve let up
on the restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Yes, I have heard of Life Magazine. I have
even heard of Margaret Bourke- White. But I don’t know why either should
be interested in an old man sitting in prison when the world is blowing
itself to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: You’re the only man I know who makes
his own clothes.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Ah, but for me that’s not much of an
accomplishment.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No – prison is rather agreeable to me, and
there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only
worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has –</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Now go on – just as you were.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: “…what shape it will take.” Jinnah has
– what?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Jinnah has – has cooperated with the
British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has
filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country
that is predominantly Hindu. That I find hard to bear – even in
prison.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: emphatically of the</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have a friend who keeps telling me how
much it costs him to keep me in poverty.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: But I know happiness does not come with
things – even twentieth century things. It can come from work, and pride
in what you do. It will not necessarily be “progress” for India if she
simply imports the unhappiness of the West.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: But do you really believe you could
use non-violence against someone like Hitler?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not without defeats – and great pain. But
are there no defeats in this war – no pain? What you cannot do is accept
injustice. From Hitler – or anyone. You must make the injustice visible
– be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Is my finger supposed to be wrapped
around that?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: No. That is what you get for distracting
me.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: What do you expect when you talk like
that?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I expect you to show as much patience as I
am now.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Every enemy is a human being – even the
worst of them. And he believes he is right and you are a beast. And if
you beat him over the head you will only convince him. But you suffer,
to show him that he is wrong, your sacrifice creates an atmosphere of
understanding – if not with him, then in the hearts of the rest of the
community on whom he depends.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: If you are right, you will win – after much
pain. If you are wrong, well, then, only you will suffer the blows.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: …not at all. Bapu has always said there were two
kinds of slavery in India – one for women, one for the untouchables –
and he has always fought against both.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Does it rankle, being separated from
him this way?</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Yes… but we see each other in the day.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: But not at night…</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: In Hindu philosophy the way to God is to free
yourself of possessions – and the passions that inflame to anger and
jealousy. Bapu has always struggled to find the way to God.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: You mean he – he gave up – married
life.</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Four times he tried – and failed. But then he
took a solemn vow…</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: And he has never broken it?</p>
<p><strong>ba</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: I’ve got permission to move her – he can go
too.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: She’s had a coronary throm – a serious heart
failure. She wouldn’t survive a trip. It’s best to leave her – and
hope.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It is time for my walk – I won’t be
long.</p>
<p><strong>mountbatten</strong>: We have come to crown victory with
friendship – to assist at the birth of an independent India and to
welcome her as an equal member in the British Commonwealth of Nations. I
am here to see that I am the last British Viceroy ever to have the honor
of such a reception.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: I don’t give a damn for the independence of
India! I am concerned about the slavery of Muslims!</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: I will not sit by to see the mastery of the
British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: believing it can’t</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: The world is not made of Mahatma Gandhis. I
am talking about the real world.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: The “real India” has Muslims and Hindus in
every village and every city! How do you propose to separate them?</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Where there is a Muslim majority – that will
be Pakistan. The rest is your India.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Mohammed – the Muslims are in a majority on
two different sides of the country.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Let us worry about Pakistan – you worry
about India.</p>
<p><strong>mountbatten</strong>: Gentlemen, perhaps we should
recommence.</p>
<p><strong>godse</strong>: Death to Jinnah! Death to Jinnah!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Thank God, they’ve stopped.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m your grand uncle but I can still walk
either of you into the ground and I don’t need to be pampered this
way!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Finish your quota of spinning.</p>
<p><strong>hindu youth</strong>: Bapu – please. Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: What do you want me not to do? Not to meet
with Mr. Jinnah? I am a Muslim! And a Hindu, and a Christian and a Jew –
and so are all of you. When you wave those flags and shout you send fear
into the hearts of your brothers.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: This is not the India I want. Stop it. For
God’s sake, stop it.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: Now, please, if you’ve finished your
prayers, could we begin with business.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: My dear Jinnah, you and I are brothers born
of the same Mother India. If you have fears, I want to put them to rest.
I am asking Panditji to stand down. I want you to be the first Prime
Minister of India – to name your entire cabinet, to make the head of
every government department a Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu, for me, and the rest, if that is what
you want, we will accept it. But out there already there is rioting
because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: If you did this, no one could control it. No
one.</p>
<p><strong>jinnah</strong>: It is your choice. Do you want an
independent India and an independent Pakistan? Or do you want civil
war?</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Aren’t you being a little
overprotective?</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: Tomorrow. Tomorrow photograph him.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: I came all this way because I believed
the picture of Independence Day was of him here alone.</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: It is violence, and the fear of
violence, that have made today what it is… Give him the dignity of his
grief.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: And while we’re sitting here feeding
goats, what will happen to all the Muslims in India and the Hindus in
Pakistan?</p>
<p><strong>kallenbach</strong>: Gandhi will pray for them…</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: No. There just are not that many troops.</p>
<p><strong>military aide</strong>: What’s he to do?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: What he can!</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: He was right. It’s insane – anything would
have been better.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Have you found him?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: He’s in Noakhali.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: He’s tramping from village to village – no
police, no troops – trying to quell the madness single-handedly. Maulana
has gone to bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>nehru’s voice</strong>: What you have done in Noakhali is a
miracle, Bapu, a miracle, but millions are on the move – millions. There
is no way to stop it… and no one can count the dead.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: In Calcutta it’s like civil war. The Muslims
rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge –
and if we can’t stop it there’ll be no hope for the Hindus left in
Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: …an eye for an eye making the whole world
blind.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: Aren’t there any troops to spare?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Nothing – nothing. The divisions in Bombay
and Delhi can hardly keep the peace now. And each fresh bit of news
creates another wave of mad… ness.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Could we cut all news off? I know –</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu – please. Where are you going.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I don’t want to hear more…</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: We need your help!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: There is nothing I can give.</p>
<p><strong>azad</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Calcutta.</p>
<p><strong>police commissioner</strong>: Sir, please, I don’t have the
men to protect you – not in a Muslim house. Not this quarter.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I am staying with the friend of a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>a youth</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>hindu youth leader</strong>: Why are you staying at the home
of a Muslim! They’re murderers! They killed my family!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Because forgiveness is the gift of the
brave.</p>
<p><strong>youth</strong>: To hell with you, Gandhi!!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Go – do as your mother and father would wish
you to do.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I have lived a lifetime. If I had shunned
death – or feared it – I would not be here. Nor would you be concerned
for me. Leave me – and take your men. You have more important things to
worry about.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Bapu… Allah be with you…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: And with you. Pray… I cannot help you –
pray… pray.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: No! There will not be a Hindu Police and a
Muslim Police. There is one police!</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Why must I read news like this in the
paper?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Tell Patel. Arrange a plane. We will go –
Friday.</p>
<p><strong>the aide</strong>: Four days?</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Sardar… You have gained weight. You must
join me in the fast.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: If I fast I die. If you fast people go to all
sorts of trouble to keep you alive.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu, forgive me – I’ve cheated. I could have
come earlier. But your fast has helped. These last days people’s minds
have begun to turn to this bed – and away from last night’s atrocity.
But now it is enough.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: All that has happened is that I’ve grown a
little thinner.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Tomorrow five thousand Muslim students of all
ages are marching here in Calcutta – for peace. And five thousand Hindu
students are marching with them. It is all organized.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m glad – but it will not be enough.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu, you are not so young anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Don’t worry for me – death will be a
deliverance. I cannot watch the destruction of all I have lived for.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: Bapu…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Each night before I sleep, I read a few
words from the Gita and the Koran, and the Bible… tonight I ask you to
share these thoughts of God with me.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: but he does it from</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: “Lead Kindly Light, amidst the circling
gloom…”</p>
<p><strong>gandhi/mirabehn</strong>: “The night is dark, and I am far
from home, Lead thou me on…”</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Who dares say such things! Who?! Come! Kill
me first! Come! Where are you?! Kill me first!</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: His pulse is very irregular – the kidneys
aren’t functioning.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Bapu, I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy. It was
he who called on the Muslims to rise; he is telling them now to go back
to their homes, to lay down their arms.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: Think what you can do by living – that you
cannot do by dying.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: That the fighting will stop – that you make
me believe it will never start again.</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: …Sometimes it is when you are quite without
hope and in utter darkness that God comes to the rescue. Gandhiji is
dying because of our madness. Put away your “revenge.” What will be
gained by more killing? Have the courage to do what you know is right.
For God’s sake, let us embrace like brothers…</p>
<p><strong>goonda leader</strong>: It is our promise. We stop. It is a
promise.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Go – try – God by with you.</p>
<p><strong>nahari</strong>: Eat.</p>
<p><strong>nahari</strong>: Eat! I am going to hell – but not with your
death on my soul.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Only God decides who goes to hell…</p>
<p><strong>nahari</strong>: I – I killed a child… I smashed his head
against a wall.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>nahari</strong>: They killed my son – my boy!</p>
<p><strong>nahari</strong>: The Muslims killed my son… they killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I know a way out of hell.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Find a child – a child whose mother and
father have been killed. A little boy – about this high.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: …and raise him – as your own.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Only be sure… that he is a Muslim. And that
you raise him as one.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Go – go. God bless you…</p>
<p><strong>constable</strong>: Yes, sir, yes, sir, “Wait.”</p>
<p><strong>constable</strong>: Accident, “Christie crossroads,” a lorry
and a rickshaw. Yes, sir, I have it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I wouldn’t have believed it,
Mr. Gupta.</p>
<p><strong>senior officer</strong>: Sergeant, it’s a bloody miracle…</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: Bapu, there’s been no fighting – anywhere.
It has stopped – the madness has stopped.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: It is foolish if it is just to save the life
of an old man.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: No… no. In every temple and mosque they
have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Maulana, my friend, could I have some orange
juice… Then you and I will take a piece of bread together…</p>
<p><strong>nehru</strong>: You see, Bapu, it is not difficult. I have
fasted only a few hours and I accomplished what you could not do in as
many days.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: That is how you eat muli.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m not sure I want to be remembered that
way.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Don’t worry, with luck you may not
be.</p>
<p><strong>patel</strong>: No, he’ll be remembered for tempting
fate.</p>
<p><strong>abha</strong>: Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: You really are going to Pakistan,
then? You are a stubborn man.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: I’m simply going to prove to Muslims there,
and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running
around in our own hearts – and that’s where all our battles ought to be
fought.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: And what kind of a warrior have you
been in that warfare?</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Not a very good one. That’s why I have so
much tolerance for the other scoundrels of the world.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Ask Panditji to – to consider what we’ve
discussed.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: One more.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: You’re a temptress.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: Just an admirer…</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Nothing’s more dangerous, especially for an
old man.</p>
<p><strong>bourke-white</strong>: There’s a sadness in him.</p>
<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: He thinks he’s failed.</p>

<p><strong>mirabehn</strong>: I am blinded by my love of him, but I
think when we most needed it, he offered the world a way out of madness.
But he doesn’t see it… and neither does the world.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Allah be with you.</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong>: Brother, Bapu is already late for prayers.</p>
<p><strong>gandhi</strong>: Oh, God… oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>manu/abha</strong>: Bapu! Bapu!</p>
<p><strong>gandhi’s voice</strong>: he spoke the words</p>
