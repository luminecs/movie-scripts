<p><strong>opening credits over super-funky blaxploitation-style
music,</strong>: which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with
the expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yo.</p>
<p><strong>int. evan’s house - kitchen - continuous</strong>: 2 2</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I was doing research last night, for next
year, and I think I’m gonna go with Bang Bus.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Which one’s Bang Bus?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: The one where they bang the chicks on the bus.
Thirteen bucks a month. Total access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
It’ll be like I’m on the bus, banging them myself.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: That stuff’s bullshit, they’re all faking it.
And plus, your parents are gonna look at the bill.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It shows up under a different name. I hope.
Bang Bus.</p>
<p>****: 2.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That wouldn’t look good. Maybe I should just
pick the one with the least dirty sounding name.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Weapons of Ass Destruction’s out then.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I could tell my parents I’m doing a project on
Rome and I have to research orgies.</p>
<p><strong>ext. evan’s house - continuous</strong>: 3 3</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class on
blow jobs.</p>
<p><strong>evan’s mom</strong>: Thanks for taking him, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Don’t touch that!</p>
<p><strong>evan’s mom</strong>: You two are so funny. I can’t imagine
what you’ll do without each other next year. Evan told me you didn’t get
into State.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, you know. I got some other places. Good
places. I think we’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>evan’s mom</strong>: Are you going to miss each other?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Miss each other? No!</p>
<p>****: 3.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Bye, boys.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I am truly, truly jealous that you got to suck
on those tits when you were a baby.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Fuck you, man.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clark secondary- soon after</strong>: 4 4</p>
<p><strong>int/ext. 7-11 store - moments later</strong>: 5 5</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You’re being an idiot, man. You really
shouldn’t park there.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fuck it. I’m a senior about to graduate. They
should be suckin’ my balls. It’s the least they can do for stealing
three years of my life.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What the hell’s wrong with Dimitri?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I knocked
the fuckin’ shit out of him in capture the flag last week.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash in
“King of the Ring.” I fucking hate that guy.</p>
<p>****: 4.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Look at those nipples.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: They’re like baby toes.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s not fair. I have to hide every erection I
get.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sometimes I get boners so big I can’t hide
them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all
just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this…thing…that’s attached
to me. And it won’t go away.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Just imagine if girls weren’t weirded out by
our boners and they actually wanted to see `em, like this shit.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You know it’s been, like, a year and a half
since I’ve seen an actual human female nipple. Besides my mom’s. I saw
it last month, and it was sick.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I guess so.
She was insanely hot, though.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Exactly. Too hot. That’s what sucks.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: How can that possibly suck? I’d be fuckin’
psyched if I’d gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen
handjobs!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: And three quarters of a blowjob, But that was
fuckin’ it. It was the peak of my ass- gettin’ career, and it happened
way, way, way too early.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You’re like Orson Welles.</p>
<p>****: 5.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Exactly! If I’d built up to it, I’d probably
at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this
point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You’ll have sex in college. Everyone does. And
if not, you’ll have the Bang Bus.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: But the key is to be good at sex by the time
you’re in college. You don’t want girls to think you suck dick at
fucking.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I still think you’ve got a chance with Jules.
She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn’t realized it, `cause
she still flirts with you.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Are you joking, man? Let’s see here…she dated
Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what’s-his-face. All of those
were cool guys. She’s been hot way longer than you think. Why would she
end her high school career with me?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser.
You’re a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy
and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months
before you leave. That bitch looks like a good fucker.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey! I’m sick of you talking about her like
that, man!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What, you can talk about that bitch all day
every single day, but I can’t say one thing about her?</p>
<p>****: 6.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I don’t constantly insult her.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I didn’t insult her! I said she looks like a
good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That’s a good thing.
Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 7-11 - continuous</strong>: 6 6</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yo. Seth. Did you hear I’m having the big
grad party?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And you’re not coming. Tell your fucking
faggot friend he can’t come either.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Wow. You really bitched out on that one.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I bitched out? You bitched out! You were
across the street before I even realized what was going on. That guy’s
such a douche bag.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clark secondary oval running track - day</strong>: 7
7</p>
<p>****: 7.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: This…is…bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Poo-say.</p>
<p><strong>int. clark secondary classroom - day</strong>: 8 8</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh, don’t worry, no worries. Just keep it.
Then you’ll just have it, and you won’t have to borrow another pen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Thanks…uh…I was going to ask you, did you
hear about Terry’s grad party? It’s going to be so insane.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, it’s a maybe. But, you know, I gotta, I
got my…</p>
<p>****: 8.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: there’s so much other fun shit that is going
to be going on that night…so, you know…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at any
parties or anything.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Because of all the other fun shit I’m off
doing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Okay. So why weren’t you at Dimitri’s party
on Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Dimitri’s? I uh…didn’t want to go, because,
well, I did other stuff. Saturday… Oh yeah! Saturday night was
awesome!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: First my parents went out to a double feature,
so a bunch of people came over…</p>
<p><strong>int. evan’s house - night</strong>: 9 9</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …and we had a couple drinks in my
basement…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …and Seth’s parents were having this cocktail
party, and we went over there to, like, mingle…</p>
<p><strong>int seth’s house - night</strong>: 10 10</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …and there were actually some really
interesting and, like, entertaining people there…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live
music.</p>
<p><strong>int. seth’s house - basement - night</strong>: 11 11</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …then we went to a club downtown…</p>
<p><strong>ext. strip club - night</strong>: 12 12</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …and then we pretty much called it a night and
went home…</p>
<p><strong>int. tbd house - night</strong>: 13 13</p>
<p><strong>int. clark secondary hallway - day</strong>: 14 14</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: …you would’ve loved it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That sounds so fun. I would love to go do
something like that.</p>
<p>****: 10.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah…well, you know, me and Seth are always
cooking up…uh…fun little…events.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: So, are you guys going to the same school
next year?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got into
different ones.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What are you going to do without him?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Same shit I’ve always been doing. It’ll be
fine. Don’t worry about it. I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>int. foods and nutrition room - next period</strong>: 15
15</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I
thought I’d be cooking with a partner. It’s not fair. She’s never here.
I don’t get twice the marks for doing all the work.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. greir</strong>: I didn’t invent odd numbers, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Look at Evan.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: While I’m over in my unit, isolated and alone,
eating my terrible-tasting food because I can’t even properly mix
ingredients by myself, I gotta look over at that.</p>
<p>****: 11.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I’m like a
single mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. greir</strong>: Well, save it for next week. Today
Jules’ partner isn’t here either. Pair up with her. Station four.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Jules?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Jules, well-dressed and “popular” looking.
She stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Hey Seth, your partner didn’t come again?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s kind of a personal question.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you’d be
forced to work with me. There’s my attempt at humour.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, I would call that a success.
Marscampone… scamponee cheese? Is that some kind of new cheese or
something?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.</p>
<p>****: 12.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Thank you! Yes! My older brother always eats
blue cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy. Like, they tell you
it’s moldy, then they tell you to eat it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well whoever “they” are, they can eat my
dick.</p>
<p><strong>int. foods and nuitrition room - later</strong>: 16 16</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t know, probably nothing. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: My parents are out of town and I’m thinking
of having a party. I don’t know how big it’ll be, but you should come
anyways.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love
parties.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Really? I don’t usually see you at them.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh, uh. It’s more of, like, a love-hate thing.
Right now I love them, though. Uh…how do I do this?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I’ll write down my address and number.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Evan.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: That’s good shit. Huh, Miroki?</p>
<p>****: 13.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Dude! She’s havin’ a fuckin’ party.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Fogell entering the room</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Don’t tell Fogell about the party.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the
way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing these tight white pants and a
black g- string and you could see it right through the pants.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - earlier</strong>: 17 17</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: It’s nine thirty.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>int. foods and nuitrition room - continuous</strong>: 18
18</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: I told her what time it was. It was awesome.
She’s got the nicest ass.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Like you’d know what to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Ha ha. I’m really gonna miss your knee-
slappers when me and Evan are at State.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, well I’ll be at Junior college where the
girls are half as smart, and thus twice as likely to blow me.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: What are you guys doing tonight?</p>
<p>****: 14.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Nothing. Sorry. You’ll just have to fingerbang
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What you doing?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Well, Seth always said I was too much of a
pussy, but he was wrong. It’s been arranged. At lunch, I’m going to the
same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand new false identification
card.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Dude! That’s perfect, `cause, Evan, didn’t you
just say that you heard about a party?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he told. And
hey! Now you can buy the booze.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Sounds cool. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. greir</strong>: If you’re not in this class, leave this
class!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Well done, man. We’ll see you after class.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Did you tell that nimrod you’re not going to
room with him?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Uh…no, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang
repellent.</p>
<p>****: 15.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Seth, dishes time. What’s the hold up?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We’re getting a fake ID.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, you two have four more years to cuddle,
so let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Actually, we’re going to different
schools.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Really? You’re cutting the cord? What’s going
to happen?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Nothing! Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah? What do people think is gonna happen?
That’s what I don’t get.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We’re not, like, dependent on each other.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We met when we were 8, we were fine before
then. It’s not like we do everything together.</p>
<p><strong>int. clark secondary cafeteria - day</strong>: 19 19</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: So it looks like we get a little graduation
party after all.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I would do terrible things to get with Jules
tonight. Terrible things.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No shit. I’d give my left foot to start dating
Helen. She’s killin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Ah, Helen’s a bitch.</p>
<p>****: 16.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m fuckin’ sick of this shit, man! Seriously.
Why do you hate her? Is there even an actual reason? Because seriously,
I’m beginning you think you like her.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hell no! I hate her.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I was never going to tell you this story,
because I knew that if you heard it you would never want to get with
Helen, but over the last few weeks I’ve been having a hard time thinking
of a reason not to. So, here it is. Helen and I went to elementary
school together, right? Well, in the third grade, I had…like…an odd
problem. For some reason, I don’t know why, I used to have this
thing…where I would…like, kinda…sit around all day and draw pictures of
dicks.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>int/ext various locations</strong>: 20 20</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’d just sit there for hours on end drawing
dicks. I don’t know what it was. I couldn’t touch the pen to paper
without it drawing a penis.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: That’s fucked.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No shit that’s fucked up. Here I am this
little kid who can’t stop drawing dicks to save his life.</p>
<p><strong>int. clark secondary cafeteria -present</strong>: 21 21</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What does that have to do with Helen?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Just listen.</p>
<p><strong>int. randolph elementary classroom -flashback</strong>: 22
22</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I was very secretive about this dick thing I
had going, after all, even I thought I was a loon, lord knows what other
people would have thought. So I would take all my dick drawings and
stick them in this Muppet lunch-box I had.</p>
<p><strong>int. randolph elementary classroom - day</strong>: 23 23</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: So one day I was finishing up a picture of a
real big and veiny bastard, when all of a sudden…</p>
<p><strong>int. clark secondary cafeteria - present</strong>: 24 24</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You hit Helen’s foot with your dick?</p>
<p><strong>int. randolph elementary classroom - moments later</strong>:
25 25</p>
<p><strong>int. clark secondary cafeteria - present</strong>: 26 26</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well she fucking flipped. She started crying
and shit. Ratted me out.</p>
<p>****: 18.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: The principle finds my cock-Muppet lunch- box,
and he fucking flips.</p>
<p><strong>int. randolph elementary principle’s office - day</strong>:
27 27</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It turns out the principle was some crazy
religious guy and he thought I was possessed by some dick devil or
something.</p>
<p><strong>int. clark secondary cafeteria - present</strong>: 28 28</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: So, he calls my parents and they make me go to
a psychologist who kept asking me all these dick questions. My parents
wouldn’t even let me eat dick-shaped foods for, like, months! No

shaped like dick?</p>

I’m going to go take a piss. Peace.</p>

<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hey. Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: So you’re coming to my party, right? It’s
fully on.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah. Why? Should I not?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: No, no, no. I really want you to come.
But…uh, you did say you were getting a fake ID or something, is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Very right. Right. I’m getting that.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Can you get us drinks?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Ummm… I don’t know. I… think…maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Come on, you scratch our backs, we’ll scratch
yours.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, funny thing about my back. It’s located
on my cock.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do you
guys want?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, this is actually, like, a big favor,
but, well, my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for
the week, but the house if full of food, so I figure I should just spend
all of it on extra drinks for the party.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Wow. I would never even think of doing
something that nice.</p>
<p>****: 20.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, this is really nice of you. I mean, I
really appreciate this.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Should I just get, like, a shitload of
different shit?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Whatever shit you think people would like, I
don’t really know.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: I want Mike’s Hard Lemonade.</p>

<p><strong>gym teacher</strong>: Evan, get into the game.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know
Jules? You know what she just did? She came up to me and asked me if I
would buy her alcohol. Not just her, her whole party. Do you know what
that means? It means that by some miracle, we were paired up, we talked,
and she actually thought of me afterwards. Thought of me enough to
decide that I was the guy that she was going to trust the fun-ness of
her party with. She wants me! She fucking wants my dick!</p>
<p>****: 21.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Did you ever think maybe she’s just using you
to get her alcohol?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO</p>

<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yeah! My older brother always eats blue
cheese. You know that stuff is actually moldy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. school field - present</strong>: 33 33</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: She has an older brother! She could have asked
him, but she asked me! She looked me straight in the face and asked me.
She wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand that? Fucking! Today is the
day that fucking has become possible.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Are you stupid? You’re not going to be able to
sleep with her tonight.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: She’s going to be at the party, she’s gonna be
drunk, and she likes me at least a little, so I can get with her. Then,
I make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck her all summer long! Then, by
the time college rolls around, I’m the fuckin’ fucking master, man!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Make her your girlfriend? Of course! That’s
good. So, hypnosis, love potion, or mind-control helmet?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Once I’ve gotten with her, I write her love
letters, flowers, I’ll do anything - I’ll be the most pussy-whipped guy
in the universe - what chick wouldn’t go out with a guy like that?</p>
<p>****: 22.</p>
<p><strong>classmate</strong>: What the hell, Evan?</p>
<p><strong>classmate</strong>: Fuck you, man.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fuck off, Greg. Why don’t you piss your pants
again?</p>
<p><strong>classmate</strong>: That was, like, eight years ago,
asshole!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Wanna hear the best part?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Oh, I haven’t?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Helen!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her
alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are both drunk, get with her! This
is the last party we’re ever going to go to as high school people! I’ve
fully ignored my hatred for Helen in coming up with this, which is a big
ass deal. We need to stop being pussy and for once just goes balls out,
man!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I should get Helen alcohol?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Of course! It’ll be pimp, and then you know
she’ll be drunk.</p>

<p><strong>seth</strong>: You talk to Helen, I’ll find that retard
Fogell.</p>

<p><strong>evan</strong>: Hey Helen! Hold up. Did you hear about the
party tonight?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah, I just heard. It sounds sweet. You’re
not coming, are you?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: No, no, I am. That’s why I came looking for
you. Me and some guys are going to the liquor store after class, so I
was thinking I could buy you yours, if you needed someone to.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah! That’d be great, that’d save me such a
hassle, cause I was going to beg my sister, but yeah, could you get me,
like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I’ll pay you back tonight.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You will absolutely not. It’s my treat.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Wow. Thanks, Evan.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hey! You punched my tit!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I’m sorry! Shit, shit. I’m so sorry! I just
wanted to give you a friendly nudge in the arm, you know? I’m so
sorry.</p>
<p>****: 24.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t worry about it. So I’ll see you at the
party?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah. I’ll see you then. I’m so sorry about
that.</p>

standing here with my thumb up my ass.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it.
It was pimp.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Whoa. That is fucking pimp. Why didn’t I do
that? Shit.</p>

he would!</p>

“Sorry, we couldn’t do what we promised because we’re dickless
incompetents!” We’ll never get laid because of that little ass-fuck. How
did he get in to State?! He’s got shit for brains! Shit! How else can we
get liquor?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Hey guys!</p>
<p>****: 25.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart
attack! You better fucking have it, where is it?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: I got it. It’s flawless! It’s great, man,
look.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Okay Mr…“McLovin”? What kind of a stupid name
is that? What are you trying to be, an Irish R&amp;B singer?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Well, they let you pick any name you want
when you get there.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: So you picked McLovin?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: It was between that or Muhammad.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why
didn’t you just pick a common name?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Actually, Seth, Muhammad is the most
commonly used name on earth.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Have you ever actually met a guy named
Muhammad?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Have you actually ever met a guy named
McLovin?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No! That’s why you picked a bad name.</p>
<p>****: 26.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You probably have federal agents tracking you
for even considering the name Muhammad on a fake ID!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Look at this shit man, you don’t even have a
first name. It just says “NAME:</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: One name?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: I just thought McLovin sounded old, and the
chicks would dig it.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Under what circumstances would you ever have
to show a chick your ID?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: She could ask. Or, I could just show it to
her.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Holy shit! I don’t believe this. This says
you’re fucking 25! Why didn’t you just put 21?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: I knew you would ask that. Look, every day,
dozens of kids roll into the liquor store with fake ID’s trying to act
like Joe Casual. Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be
21 years old. Just how many 21 year-olds do you think there are?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fool!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Calm down! It’s not terrible! This might work,
but it’s up to you, Fogell. They’ll either think, “Oh, it’s another punk
kid with a fake ID.” Or, “Look, it’s McLovin, the twenty five year-old
organ donor”. What’s it gonna be?</p>
<p>****: 27.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: I am McLovin.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re not McLovin. No one’s McLovin and this
is never going to work. We need a new way to get alcohol. Could we drive
to Canada or something?</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: I still think it’s going to work.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What the fuck? Where’s my car?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I told you, man! What did I say? I told you
that was a dumb idea.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Why would you park in the staff-</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shut up, Fogell.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: `Cause you’re not staff.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I am aware of that, Fagell.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Will you still pick me up from work?</p>

<p><strong>seth</strong>: Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and steal
your parents’ booze like your brother always does. Take a bit from every
bottle. Piece of cake. It’s not exactly what Jules wanted, but it’ll do,
right?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Come on! Just wear what you wore to
school.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I told you I can’t do that. I can’t let Jules
see me in the same shit I wore at school. It’s completely
unbecoming.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Why don’t you just go to your house and get
your own clothes? `Cause this is stupid.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re stupid! I can’t go home. Then my mom
will know the car got towed and I’ll be grounded tonight. I’ll just stay
here all weekend and pick it up on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Where the fuck is the dirt bike? Ah, screw it.
I’m just gonna kill everyone. Boom! Die, piggies!!!</p>

Mom in the basement while you steal the liquor.</p>

and grab it.</p>

are fuckers. What do we do now?</p>

with water. Get ready, I’ll get water.</p>

it! She’s right in the other room!</p>

alcohol tolerance. I’m like Superman.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s fucking water!</p>
<p>****: 31.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Water? Fuck. Your brother beat us to the
punch. We have to go back!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: We can’t go back! She totally knew, she’ll
bust us for sure, and we have to meet Fogell.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, fuck…fine. Text your brother he’s a
stupid piece of crap.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shopwells - dusk</strong>: 42 42</p>

<p><strong>evan</strong>: What? It’s just a vest.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in
vests?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You know, they got a ton of liquor right in
there. If we get it now we can get to the party faster with all of
Jules’ shit.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: No way! I work there. They know I’m not
twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Nobody said anything about you, dick- mouth.
You have one name on your ID. It’s out of the equation!</p>
<p>****: 32.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: And now I’m gonna have to take drastic
measures. I’m gonna steal the booze.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: What?! No! Hell no! You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, right!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s right. And that way I give Jules back
her money, like you did with Helen. That was good thinking, that’s
fucking pimp. That’s how you seal a deal. It won’t be hard. Remember Dan
Vertlieb stole a keg from here and he’s got, like, really bad
scoliosis!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: You’re not gonna steal it. Fogell, he’s not
going to steal it.</p>
<p><strong>fogell</strong>: Please. Don’t do this! I promise. I’ll get
the liquor later.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m stepping up. And once I’m up, I don’t step
back down. Maybe you “State” boys don’t understand that.</p>

store sees them kicking me out. What if they make me put all the liquor
back on the shelf? I can’t do that!</p>

Just go in there and buy the damn alcohol!</p>

hands to pull off a procedure like that!</p>

didn’t even bring one?</p>

is.</p>

She’ll love that. She’ll want to go out with that.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Yeah, but I figured there’s no harm in
bringing just one little condom.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: And one little bottle of spermicidal lube.
That’s nuts. You can’t let her know you brought that! These girls are
18, not dried up old ladies. They’re ready to go.</p>
