<p><strong>fade in:</strong>: FROM SPACE, a view of the EARTH. The
vibrant BLUE of its OCEANS is striking against the vast BLACK VOID of
space. MOVE CLOSER TO THE EARTH, where the shimmering PACIFIC OCEAN
meets the CALIFORNIA COASTLINE… A bird’s-eye view of LOS ANGELES comes
into relief– a criss- cross of streets, freeways. The buildings not more
than dots. Keep MOVING CLOSER as SOUND FADES IN. We notice MOVEMENT
through the sprawl of city now: MASSES OF PEOPLE and CARS moving AWAY
FROM THE OCEAN as we arrive at…</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: LOS ANGELES– CONTACT + 1 HOUR as we…</p>
<p><strong>super: marine corps base, camp pendleton. oceanside,
ca.</strong>: Then SUPER: THE DAY BEFORE… We are CLOSE ON: SERGEANT
MICHAEL NANTZ late 30s, tall, battle-hardened, staring forward,
listening impatiently.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: Must be some kind of mistake… Company
1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his desk, holding
Nantz’ file. Smiles.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: I got paperwork here, with your
signature, says you’re retiring.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: No mistake, John.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: My ass. You got a box full a’, medals,
file full a’ commendations.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: They can take the Good Conduct Medal and
shove it up their…</p>
<p>****: See, that’s what I’m talking about, Mike. You’re a marine!
Nantzsmiles back now.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I appreciate it, John. You know that.
But, I been to too many funerals. Had to visit too many moms and dads,
tell ’em about what happened to their sons…</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: Look. You’re on that training
assignment right now. Why don’t you just ride it out for a month or two.
See how you feel…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I did my twenty. I’m done. Roy takes
this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: You’re gonna miss it. Nantz
shakes.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>the green wash of night vision goggles</strong>: Looking out
onto ROLLING HILLS and TREES… We hear :</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: I don’t see it…</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: I’m telling you, it’s in the trees.</p>
<p><strong>five marines</strong>: From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion,
5th Marines .. Camo uniforms, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES on, stare into the
DARK. CPL. CORREGGIO, 20, linebacker-big, shakes his head,
frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Screw it. I’m gonna launch another
one… The other marines back away quickly as… WIDEN to see we’re…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio -</strong>: That’s more like it. PVT. LENIHAN,
18, baby-faced, looks impressed.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Sweet. PVT. IMLAY, 19, a dense but
good-natured country boy, moves to the tee.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Don’t encourage him. Correggio’s
freakin’ ego’s big enough already. He takes the club from Correggio.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Let an expert show you how it’s done,
bro. Imlay TEES OFF, his swing plainly choppy, uncoordinated.</p>
<p><strong>pov through imlay’s night vision goggles</strong>: As he
WHACKS THE BALL, visible in the night vision’s greenish glow. It HOOKS
into a sand trap.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Mother fu…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Foot mobiles. 3 O’clock.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Told you they’d come! THREE GIRLS,
19-21, signal with a FLASHLIGHT. Then race down a small hill onto the
golf course.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: That dog’ll hunt! Damn, Daktari, you can
play!</p>
<p>****: We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Well, how would I know? I mean, it’s an
American game.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Actually, Imlay, it’s Scottish. PVT.
KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Lenihan, you as good with an M-16 as you
are with your mouth?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Kerns. Lay off him.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: What? Just wanna make sure the rookie
won’t fold under fire. Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns’ hand.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Relax, dude. He throws an arm around
Kerns’ shoulder, smiles at the girls.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: My buddy’s jumpy ‘cause he got an
assfull a’ shrapnel our last tour.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: I’m jumpy? You’re crawling up your own
ass ’cause we train with Sgt. Nantz tomorrow. Correggio eyes Kerns. This
was the wrong thing to say. One girl, smiling seductively, steps to
Correggio, takes the golf club.from him.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: If this is the officer’s course, what
happens if they catch you out here? She readies to take a shot.
Correggio snuggles up behind her, ostensibly teaching her how to
swing.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: We can handle it, baby. We’re
experts at night maneuvers. Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: So you’re from where again? Imlay pops a
beer, interrupting.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Nigeria. Adukwu’s our corpsman. Like a
medic. Saved Kerns’ ass.</p>
<p>****: Daktari, tell her about Nigeria. Adukwu starts to talk, but
Imlay interrupts again:</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Adukwu’s a green card marine… And
Lenihan here– He’s just green. Mom signed so he could join at 17. I’m
looking after him since he don’t know his ass from a hot rock. Lenihan
suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up.</p>
<p><strong>girl #3</strong>: You’re doing a good job.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Yeah. We always take the new meat out
here to christen ’em… Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the
Tahoe.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Hey, barfy. Grab your beer. toast.
Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: To Lenihan. Who gets his first taste a’
those hills tomorrow. He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near
the course.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Good luck, rookie. The marines chuckle
knowingly, about to drink… Then they hear the sound of TIRES skidding to
a halt. They look toward the hillside, see the WHITE HELMETS’of MPs.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: MPs! The marines grab the goggles
and clubs, pile…</p>
<p><strong>into the tahoe</strong>: With the girls. The Tahoe skids
away, the beer CRASHING off’ the back. The first girl eyes
Correggio.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Experts, huh? Correggio grins sheepishly.
She smiles. sweetly, taking his hand, writing her PHONE NUMBER on the
back of it as…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: .what appears to be an unprecedented
meteor shower, falling off the Falkland Islands.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: What are you doing up so early? She
holds up the object in her hands– It’s Martinez’</p>
<p>****: Lieutenant. I still have to get used to that. She kisses him
lightly, stands. Martinez smiles, watching her move off.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Yeah, lot of things we gotta get used
to. We see her VERY PREGNANT BELLY now as she smiles back, exits. As she
does, Martinez turns back to the TELEVISION: ‘METEORS’ falling into a
distant ocean.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: This dazzling display is visible from
Argentina to Southern Chile.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Call me later.</p>
<p>****: I’ll call you later. He stops, smiling back at her now. She
waves coyly. Then Martinez is RUNNING BACK TO THE APARTMENT. Moving with
the grace of the college football player he was just a few years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Heard Nantz put in his papers. He’s
out.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Good. Wish he done it years ago.
Lenihan, struggling, breathing hard, looks up at this, STUMBLING as he
does. Nantz, looking back at the chatter, sees… Imlay grab hold of
Lenihan, helping him forward now.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Goddamn it, Imlay, you gonna wipe his
ass for him, too? Every man carries his weight! Nantz drops back, runs
alongside the struggling Lenihan.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Just quit, Lenihan. Do us all a favor.
’Cause the squad’s only as strong as the weakest man.,.. Lenihan
STUMBLES and FALLS IN THE DIRT.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: And right now you’re getting us all
killed. You hear? On these words, NANTZ MEETS EYES WITH CORREGGIO,
further back in the pack. Nantz looks away, sees… Imlay, suddenly at
Lenihan’s side, helping him up. Nantz shoves Imlay away, knocking him
onto his ass.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You think you’re helping him, Imlay!?
You think you’re making him stronger?! Nantz puts a boot into Imlay’s
chest, shoving him flat. Correggio stares at this, steaming.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Stay on the goddamn ground, Imlay!
You’ve just been gut-shot.</p>
<p>****: Your buddy’s down, bleeding to death, Lenihan. LZ’s at the top
of this hill. You gonna let this man die in the dirt on some stinking
hill? Or are you marine enough to save him?! Lenihan stumbles to his
feet, wiping dirt from his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: I’m gonna save him, sir! Lenihan
bends, strains, somehow heaves Imlay up. He begins STUMBLING UP THE
HILL, carrying Imlay on his back.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Come on, goddamnit! It’s a hot LZ! The
chopper’s gotta move! They’re gonna leave you BOTH to die!!! Lenihan
staggers, knees trembling, weaving back and forth. Then his foot comes
down on a ROCK IN THE TRAIL. His ANKLE GIVES WAY. Lenihan falls, yells
in pain, grabbing his ankle.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Don’t you ever tell me you can’t!
Correggio takes a step towards Nantz now. Kerns stops him.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: He’s injured, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: He’s not injured. He twisted his goddamn
ankle. Nantz’ looks over the men, sweaty, covered with grime.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We are marines. “Can’t” is not the code
we live by. “Can’t” gets marines killed. Do things the right way, the
marine way, maybe you get to come home… Maybe your buddy gets to come
home. Correggio stares back sullenly on this.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Dying’s easy, ladies. Everything else
takes balls. Nantz spits on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Adukwu. Run a bag of saline into Lenihan
and tape that ankle. We start back in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: .meteors are falling off the coasts of
California, Ireland, India, in the Bay of Bengal– all less than ten
miles from land…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Man, I thought Lenihan was gonna wash
out today.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Hey, I remember carrying your fat ass
up that hill hung over as shit. Newbie gets no sympathy from me.</p>
<p><strong>cherise</strong>: For three hundred more, she said we could
have sprays of lilies. I know it’s a lot, but it’d be so beautiful. What
d’you think, baby? Harris looks pained. But before he can speak up:</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Well, I think it’s a no-brainer.
You’re only getting married once! What, are you gonna worry about three
hundred bucks? Cherise looks expectantly to Harris, who smiles back
weakly.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Of course, baby. Whatever you want She
kisses him, heads to the florist as Harris turns on</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Dude, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Busting your balls.</p>
<p>****: Tomorrow we shop for cake. Stavrou throws an arm round Harris’
shoulder, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: I love cake.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Still not sleeping… And the
nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: No. I mean, sometimes. But it’s no big
deal.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: You’re not drinking, right, private?
That’s just a crutch…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Alcohol? No, sir. Definitely not. The
psychiatrist stares at this. Then WRITES in the file.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: So… What’s my status? Am I cleared for
combat? I feel good.</p>
<p>****: Let’s meet again next week.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. simmons</strong>: I don’t know why they always have to
give us shit. It’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. grayston</strong>: Question is, why does everybody think
life’s supposed to be fair? Why do bad guys want to kill us? Why can’t I
have a nipple ring? Why is it the more power we get, the more we want?
Nothing’s fair, Simmons.</p>
<p>****: Whatever, Corporal. I just like to blow shit up. Suddenly, a
SIREN begins WAILING from the base. Grayston and Simmons exchange a
glance. They start paddling in quickly.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Hold. The squad stops, following Nantz’
gaze to… An approaching dust cloud, being kicked up by… A HUMVEE and TWO
FIVE-TON TRUCKS Speeding up the dirt road toward the marines. Everyone
is silent as they watch the HUMVEE and TRUCKS pull up… This is not
normal. 1st Sergeant Roy hops from the Humvee, shouting:</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: Marines! Into the trucks. Now. Proceed
to the armory and draw weapons. The marines exchange glances, heading
for the five-tons. Roy motions to Nantz, who follows him to the
Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What’s going on, John?</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: Look, Mike, I know you’re burnt out,
ready to move on… Whatever you want to call it. But everybody’s being
deployed right now. And the platoon’s down a sergeant. We need you.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: For what? Do I have a choice here? They
arrive at the Humvee. Roy turns to Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: No. You don’t. It’s all hands on deck,
Mike. Nantz nods, resigned. Starts climbing into the Humvee.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Just don’t lose my paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt.. roy</strong>: Meteor storm’s hittin’ up and down
California now… All I know is, this is a helluva lot more than just some
space rocks fallin’ out to sea…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What d’you mean? He turns., stares at
Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: Whole base is being mobilized. There’s
some kinda’ bad shit hittin’ the fan.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: You’re assigned to 1st platoon, under
Lt. Bennie Martinez. His platoon sergeant was rushing back to base, got
in a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What are the odds? As the Humvee pulls
to the COMMAND BUILDING, Nantz sees… LT. MARTINEZ hurrying to meet
them.</p>
<p><strong>1st sgt. roy</strong>: There’s the lieutenant. Young, been
with us three months, straight outta basics school. Bright kid, but this
is his first deployment, so keep an eye on him, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: It’s probably just a drill, right?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: They shifted Nantz into our unit.
Something must be going on.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: I heard Nantz kicked ass on his last
tour. Went into a compound by himself, killed, like, ten insurgents…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: That what you heard? You don’t know
shit, Lenihan. Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the
door.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Move your asses. They want us in the
armory. And he’s gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: What’s his problem?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Nantz lost a lotta guys on that tour.
Correggio’s brother was one of ’em. Lenihan nods, somber, getting
it.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporters</strong>: .cluster of what appears to be meteors
is tightly packed… hard for scientists to predict the size or quantity
striking the oceans…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: They calling us.in because of these
meteors, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: I assume so… Maybe an evacuation.
Whatever it is, it’ll be good to get out in the field with the men.
Nantz looks askance at this. Martinez catches it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Look, Sergeant, let’s be clear. I know
your rep, know what you’ve done… But this is my unit. We’re not gonna
have a problem, are we?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: No problem, sir. It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: We never got a chance to finish the
new mix, man. We were gonna add some metal to it…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. guerrero</strong>: We’ll have time later.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: .National Guard troops have flown in to
evacuate all surrounding beach areas…</p>
<p>****: Yeah… Later.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: These objects were completely undetected
until they entered our atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: So… what are they, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We have no idea. But whatever they are,
they’re not hitting the water at terminal velocity. They’re able to slow
down before impact. Glances exchanged in the room now.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: This is no meteor shower. Homeland Security
has bumped the threat level to red. Marines, we are the first line of
defense. All units gear up, be ready to move.</p>
<p><strong>the television:</strong>: The REPORTER on the beach looks
harried now as THICK SMOKE rolls in across the water. POLICE SIRENS wail
in the b.g.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: .some sort of smoke has appeared over the
ocean now…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Hey, shut up. Shut up! Others quiet
down now. All focus slowly shifting to…</p>
<p><strong>the tv:</strong>: The reporter on the beach is cupping her
earpiece.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I’m being told a Coast Guard cutter just
issued a Mayday… The TV SHOT PANS to the WATER… The DISTANT CUTTER lists
to one side, SINKING below the waves as indistinct DARK SHAPES clamber
onto it from the water.</p>
<p><strong>the marines</strong>: Push forward, scrambling to the
TVs.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: What the hell are those things?!</p>
<p><strong>on the tv:</strong>: The CUTTER DISAPPEARS behind the thick
rolling SMOKE. The camera PANS back to the REPORTER, silently staring
out.</p>
<p><strong>2/5 parade deck / camp pendleton - same</strong>: Crowded
with MARINES, including squad leader Grayston, all getting ready. Or
they were… Right now, ACTIVITY HAS CEASED. Marines silently stare
at…</p>
<p><strong>televisions</strong>: The REPORTER ON THE BEACH staring out,
clearly panicked.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: It appears… the cutter has… She stops,
seeing the SMOKE reach the WATER’S EDGE. A HUSH falls over the CROWD as
SMOKE rolls across the beach.</p>
<p><strong>televisions</strong>: As the REPORTER reacts to isolated
SHOUTS echoing from the crowd on the beach. Some are pointing out to the
ocean…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What is that…? In the water… The news
cameraman PANS to the WATER as it begins to CHURN.</p>
<p><strong>a television:</strong>: SCREAMS and panicked voices ring out
from those ON THE BEACH now as INDISTINCT FIGURES appear from under the
waves. PEOPLE RACE AWAY, plodding along the sand in hopeless flight as
these FIGURES charge into the crowd… GUNSHOTS ring out, police shooting
at the INDISTINCT FIGURES that appear, then disappear in the
EVER-THICKENING SMOKE. MOVE IN ON NANTZ, staring at the TV as… The news
cameraman RUNS away now, the PICTURE being transmitted growing shaky,
indistinct, frenzied as… A DARK FIGURE appears, overruns the cameraman
as… The NEWS CAMERA suddenly cuts to BLACK. In black, all we hear is
SCREAMS echoing from the beach.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz will
be taking over for Sgt. Beck. We’re lucky to have him aboard. The CH-46
helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door opening for them.
Martinez barks:</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Let’s move, men!, The platoon grabs
gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing aboard. Nantz hurries them
along, grabbing packs, throwing them on after the marines. Then he grabs
Correggio’s pack, about to throw the pack on… Correggio grabs it back
from Nantz. Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You got something to get off your chest,
Corporal?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: No. It’s cool, Sergeant. You got a
Silver Star and my brother came home in a box. I get it. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Get aboard, Corporal. Correggio jumps
into the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. guerrero</strong>: What the hell you think those things
are?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Gotta be extraterrestrial.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: You mean, like, from space?!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: No, Imlay. From Canada. Correggio
looks down at his hand… Sees the GIRL’S PHONE NUMBER written on it.
ACROSS THE DECK, Martinez huddles with Nantz, MAP in hand.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Santa Monica airport’s our Forward
Operating Base. We get some Cobras and F-18s in the air, we’ll have
plenty of support. Nantz nods. They’re flying into the unknown and
Martinez seems as nervous as the younger men. Kerns leans in to Nantz,
desperately needing reassurance.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: How many a’ them you think there are,
Sergeant? Nantz just stares out, stone-faced.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’ll know soon enough, private.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of the
2/5.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Situation is as follows: Most of Santa
Monica is cleared of civilians. We’ve got a defensive line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean… He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a
MAP, the OCEAN close by.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln to the
ocean will be bombed. Martinez blanches.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: We’re… leveling it, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We’ve got an infestation of god-
knows-what. It’s an enemy ground force only, they have no aircraft. So
our jets’ll tear ’em a new asshole. We will rule the air.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: But… there must be civilians stuck
behind the line, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That’s affirm. We’re getting distress
calls, sending squads out. He points to the MAP, to streets running from
Lincoln Blvd.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Your mission, Lieutenant, take your 1st
squad, proceed west from Lincoln to a community center located here… In
a park on 10th and Bay Street. Police were using it as an evacuation
point. They got overrun. Get there, any civilians you find, get ’em back
here to the FOB for evacuation. You got three hours. Another CHOPPER is
LANDING. Nantz yells over the sound:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What do we know about these things,
Captain?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Not much. But police have shot ’em. They
bleed. The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back:</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s our job to kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Let’s go, marines! Clock’s running.
Focus on the mission. We’re gonna get to that community center and get
those people safe. A COBRA ATTACK HELICOPTER screams overhead, firing
into the distance. Martinez turns to Nantz, shouting over the din:</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Something to add, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Kill anything that’s not human.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: What the hell is that?!</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Keep it together. Watch your angles.
The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again. The squad continues DOWN THE
STREET.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Helluva way to get citizenship, eh,
Daktari?</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Shit, I’d rather be in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Cherise and I were supposed to register
at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond tonight…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Think you’re gonna be busy, bro. Nantz
points his rifle into a CRASHED PICKUP TRUCK. A BODY is slumped beneath
the wheel. Simmons comes up behind Nantz. Peers into the truck: Sections
of the BODY appear almost dissolved by a white phosphorous-like
substance.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. simmons</strong>: What is that shit, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Something bad, private. Now get back
with your team.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Whoa, whoa… Contact! Twelve o’clock! A
SHAPE is moving to them through the smoke. The marines aim, about to
fire just as the smoke clears… A DOG. Standing there, staring mournfully
at them. Nervous chuckles now. Correggio sidles up to Kerns.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Relax, man. Kerns just shoots him a
look. The squad moves on. As they approach a SIDE STREET that intersects
10th… The DOG WHINES. Correggio pets it, trying to comfort it…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Something spooked that dog… Then Kerns
sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET… As if something is racing
through it. Kerns breaks formation, SPRINTS DOWN THE SIDE STREET,
FIRING.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Contact! Contact! Discipline shatters as
the squad follows Kerns…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Marines! Hold your position! Kerns
stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged, eyes panicked.
Correggio races up.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: What’d you see?! Suddenly, the
INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears through the smoke, moving
FAST down the side street. Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react,
FIRING as well. The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns’ face.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: One enemy runs and you break discipline
and chase it?! Think, marines. Stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: The sergeant is right. Stay on course.
We have a mission…</p>
<p>****: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: How many rounds it take?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Enough. Correggio edges to Kerns,
who’s looking panicky.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: They’re real, bro. I kept prayin’ they
wouldn’t be…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Quiet. Nantz, unnerved himself, stares
into the smoke…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: What is it, sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: That thing running down the street… That
was to draw us in… Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now… A
RUMBLING SOUND BEHIND THEM. Building. Nantz spins to it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: They’re coming. We took the bait, now
they’re cutting us off.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: I can’t see a goddamn thing! But the
SOUND of their ADVANCE tells us there’s many.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Light it up! The squad lets loose with a
barrage of FIRE as…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Mottola, get on the radio. See if we
can get some air support. Mottola starts working the radio, trying to
remain calm as.’.. PROJECTILES EXPLODE in BRIGHT FLASHES around the
marines.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. simmons</strong>: Contact front! Contact front!
Correggio, frustrated, peers through the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: What are we shooting at?!</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: Lieutenant. Command says air power is
totally committed. Enemy contact all over the area… Martinez stares back
at this ominous news as… The MARINES FIRE back into the THICK SMOKE. But
the enemy attack keeps INCREASING in ferocity. One PROJECTILE hits a
wall above Lenihan. It EXPLODES, some kind of liquid splashing onto him.
Lenihan grimaces.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Ahh, shit! It’s burning! His HELMET is
being eaten away by the liquid. Imlay is immediately at Lenihan’s side,
pulling the helmet off. Lenihan’s skin is blistering, oozing.</p>
<p>****: My face, man…! How’s my face?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Ugly as ever, bro. The squad hunkers
down, trying to find any cover-available– behind cars, trees. Martinez
drops BEHIND A CAR, pulls out his MAP, checking it for escape
routes.-</p>
<p>****: Fall back! Here! He leads them further down the side
street.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We can hold this position,
Lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: We’re gonna get pinned down!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Sir, these things seem to be operating
tactically! Don’t let them dictate your decisions…</p>
<p>****: Move to live, marines! The squad follows Martinez,
retreating…</p>
<p><strong>into a ‘walk’ street.</strong>: JUST A SIDEWALK separates the
houses opposite each other. A moment. SILENCE. Nantz looks at the heavy
FOLIAGE, dense SHRUBS and TREES on both sides. He knows:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: It’s an ambush. This is the kill zone!
Nantz slings his COMBAT SHOTGUN forward.</p>
<p><strong>fire!</strong>: On Nantz’ order, the SQUAD OPENS FIRE just
as… ALIEN FIRE EXPLODES from the THICK COVER of bushes and trees. Nantz
leads the brutal counterattack, PUMPING and FIRING his combat SHOTGUN.
Martinez is shouting orders, directing the men as…</p>
<p><strong>the front yard of a house.</strong>: The squad follows,
Correggio pulling Kerns into the yard.</p>
<p><strong>they back toward the house.</strong>: Guerrero, Imlay and
Simmons lay down an awesome barrage with powerful SAWS , covering.the
retreat. Trees and bushes are shredded, houses are splintered. All this
mayhem allows the squad to…</p>
<p><strong>barge through the front door of the house.</strong>:
Pandemonium. The marines are sweaty, bleeding, scared.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. simmons</strong>: Jesus! Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Keep your shit together!</p>
<p><strong>pvt. simmons</strong>: What the hell are those things?!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: They’re the goddamn enemy.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Yeah, and there’s a million of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>pvt. simmons</strong>: Where’d they come from?! Why’d they
come here?!</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Everyone… just calm down.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. simmons</strong>: Calm down?! We keep shooting them… Why
don’t they die?!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Stow that shit, Private. Watch the yard.
Secure the back. We’re not dyin’ here today. The marines take up firing
positions at windows and doors.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: You okay? Kerns stares back, deer in
the headlights. He nods. ADUKWU IS WRAPPING GRAYSTON’S ARM as Grayston
fumbles for a CIGARETTE. Adukwu lights it for him.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. grayston</strong>: I know. These things’ll kill me.
Adukwu smiles. Grayston stares at his arm, ironically:</p>
<p><strong>cpl. grayston</strong>: Hell, now that just ain’t fair. Nantz
moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded Grayston and
Guerrero.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Sir, what are your orders? Martinez
turns, stares at Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: I led us right into that ambush.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Sir. Your orders. Beat. Martinez
nods.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Let’s figure out how we get out of
here. We’ll medevac the wounded from that park.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at that
park by the community center. As Mottola works the radio, he’s startled
to see Guerrero, who has been SLASHED across both eyes.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. guerrero</strong>: I can’t see, Motorola. Mottola,
horrified, steadies his voice.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: You’ll be okay. A slight beat.
Then…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. guerrero</strong>: You’re one shitty liar, bro.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?!
Everyone stops, stares.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I’ll go for Lenihan, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: All right. We’ll package the wounded,
then rally on 10th street.</p>
<p>****: Mottola, Imlay. Go with the sergeant. The two quickly step to
Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: We got your six, Sergeant. Anything you
need.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What I need is for you to keep quiet.
And stay close.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Right. Got it. Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Starting now, Private. As Nantz turns,
Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Motorola? You copy? His RADIO buzzes
back with Nantz’ voice:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Sergeant, Jesus, I had to turn the
radio off..’. These things are everywhere!</p>
<p>****: We’re coming for you, Lenihan. What’s your location?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: I’m in a garage… I can see two palm
trees right next to it. House is white with black shutters… Just as
something BANGS against the garage.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Is the house a two-story? Lenihan
stares, his eyes going wide, panicked.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Lenihan, is the house a…? Lenihan CLICKS
the radio OFF. Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His
breathing turns shallow– from loss of blood and from fear. Lenihan sees
the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the window, as if something just
brushed past it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Lenihan…? Lenihan…? Imlay taps Nantz on
the shoulder, motions to his ears. He hears something… The marines
freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as… Nearby, they hear SOUNDS of
aliens running… Somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>a shadowy alien form is rising from the pool.</strong>:
Lenihan doesn’t see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES… A SPLASH as
the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE POOL, disappearing
under the water. Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the
pool. He peers over the pool edge… An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on
the bottom of the pool. Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises
his rifle to punch more rounds into the thing as… WHOOOM! The creature
launches OUT OF THE WATER!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. mottola</strong>: Oh my God… What the hell are these
things?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: They’re butt ugly, that’s what they are.
Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re gonna get you to the medevac,
Private.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Thank you, Sergeant. Thanks for coming
for me.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: But Lenihan…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Yes, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Ever get separated from your unit again,
I’ll find you and shoot you myself.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. lenihan</strong>: Yes, Sergeant. Imlay slings Lenihan’s
arm around his shoulder and they’re instantly moving, RUNNING FROM THE
YARD.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: All right, let’s get to the community
center… They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as THWACK! An
alien projectile slams INTO SIMMONS’ THROAT. Choking, he CRUMPLES to the
ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless. Panic. The marines spin,
searching for targets.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Move! Grab Simmons! Go, go! Stavrou
hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to cover their retreat,
as… The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant rooftops,
watching the rifle squad disappear down the street.</p>
<p><strong>at them…</strong>: The marines all shift, aim forward, about
to blast away as… FOUR MARINES come into view, moving ghost-like. Nantz
signals with his flashlight. The marines hurry over, silently falling
behind the cars.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: You guys are 2/5?</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: 2nd squad, 3rd platoon…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Where’s the rest of your unit?</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: This is it, Lieutenant. Everyone else is
dead or missing. The news hits Martinez hard. He eyes Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: We were on the street, like, ten minutes and
they ambushed us. As soon as we radioed for help, it’s like they were
everywhere…</p>
<p>****: Medevac’s incoming, lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: All right. Stay with us. And the squad
moves out…</p>
<p><strong>a medevac helicopter</strong>: Descending steadily, its
thundering rotors whipping the air..</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Load the wounded. Sgt. Nantz, Cpl.
Harris– let’s find the civilians. Martinez, Nantz and Harris run to the
community center as… The WOUNDED are hustled to the CHOPPER as it
TOUCHES DOWN.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines! A
clattering. The marines immediately move toward it, peering down the
dark hall…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: How many of you? A MAN, JOE RINCON, 45,
jacket and tie, behind her.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: There’s five of us. Three kids. Nantz is
immediately moving.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Where? Where are the kids? He pushes
past the adults, sees TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, 8-10.</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: You called in with two wounded!</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: We got four!</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: Can’t take four! We have no room!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Make goddamn room! A beat. The crewman
relents in the face of Stavrou’s impressive bulk, tries to make room.
Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on. Mottola helps Guerrero
in, squeezing his hand.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. guerrero</strong>: I’ll work on that mix for you.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: Thanks, dude. Think I’m gonna need it.
Lenihan crawls onto the chopper’s deck with Imlay’s help.</p>
<p>****: You just had to get outta the shit. Lenihan smiles back.</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: Now! We’re moving now! Imlay bumps fists
with Lenihan, backs away as…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Wait! Stavrou, hold it! KIDS! Stavrou
tries to hold the chopper, screaming at it as…</p>
<p><strong>the medevac rises.</strong>: Nantz, Martinez and Harris run
to the chopper with the kids. The marines around the medevac are
screaming up at it, trying to hold it, but to no avail. The CHOPPER
GAINS ALTITUDE as suddenly… BOOM! A SHOCK WAVE OF ENERGY FIRES from the
west as… The MEDEVAC takes a DIRECT HIT. The devastating energy wave
blasts it END-OVER-END… The massive helicopter CRASHES INTO A HOUSE
blocks away, exploding, as… Nantz turns ominously as an unearthly
BUZZING SOUND FADES IN. LIGHTS are ADVANCING from a street leading to
the field. As the SOUND and LIGHTS BUILD, Nantz runs to the other
marines to get them off that field. He pulls on them, urging them to the
COMMUNITY CENTER doors. They REACH THE COMMUNITY CENTER, fall into it
just as… Glowing through the heavy cover of smoke… The STROBING LIGHTS
of some strange ALIEN AIRCRAFT zooming overhead.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Goddamn flying saucers now…?!</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: All those guys on the chopper…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Why’d those bastards have to come down
here and start this shit?!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: That is not relevant, Imlay! They’re
here. They’re trying to kill us. Kill them first! Martinez eyes Nantz on
this. Then barks orders:</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Secure the perimeter! Stavrou, give me
an ammo check. Cpl. Correggio, take three men, set up an Observation
Post on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You heard the lieutenant. Move! The
dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see in their FACES
that it’s a very different fight now. Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC
ABLAZE out a window. His solemn stare hints at a growing desperation.
Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly:</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: They got air power, too… Knocked that
medevac right out of the sky. So much for ruling the air. Nantz just
keeps staring out.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Listen, Sergeant. These men are
scared. A little compassion would go a long way… Nantz turns on Martinez
now.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: How’s that gonna help them survive,
Lieutenant?</p>
<p>****: I’ll lead these marines. But don’t ask me to get close to them.
Nantz walks off.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re not gonna leave us, are you? A beat.
Then Imlay smiles.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: No way, sweetheart. The woman, Michele
McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling for composure, eyes constantly
moving to the kids. Mr. Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands
with his son, HECTOR, the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: My son and I came here… There were only
three cops, spread pretty thin… Then those things attacked. Police
couldn’t stop them.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What happened to everyone?</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: I don’t know. Most people ran. We hid in a
side room, found Michele and the girls… Couldn’t see what happened. Just
heard… Screams.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: I have my nieces for the week. My sister
and her husband are in Hawaii for their anniversary… Is it safe there? I
heard this is happening in other places… Martinez is at a loss for
words.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: What do they want from us? Why are they
here?</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: I…don’t know. Right now, our job is
just to get you to safety, okay? Harris appears from the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Lieutenant, something you should
see…</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Want some Nerds? Imlay holds his hand out.
Hector shakes candy into it as… Nantz enters, calling to Adukwu:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Adukwu, bring your kit. Adukwu is
immediately up, moving to Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re gonna cut one of these things
open. See if we can figure out what makes ’em tick. Michele overhears,
offering:</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: Maybe I can help, sergeant. I’m a vet…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You’re a veteran?</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: No, a veterinarian.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Oh… Okay. Well, thanks, um… Nantz has
forgotten her name. She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: Michele.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Right. Michele. Sorry. Mottola walks
up.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: Sergeant. Can’t raise anybody on the
radio. We’re cut off. Off Nantz’ look…</p>
<p>****: O.P. reporting. We’re clear up here. Correggio and Kerns look
over the destroyed streets, smoke and flames rising from buildings in
the distance, glimpses of white phosphorous raining down. A beat,
then…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: .fucking aliens. Kerns looks at
Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity of it all. Then Correggio
laughs. It’s infectious. It’s desperate. Then the laughter slows.
Stops.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: You think those things get scared?
They’re probably just grunts like us. Probably dumped into battle, told
to go fight… Kerns looks out… The constant thud and crack of warfare… A
city crumbling. V</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: I thought I could handle it…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: You are handling it. Thing I’m
worried about is Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Sergeant saved our ass at that ambush…
He knows what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Yeah? Tell my brother that.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You sure you can do this?</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: I was more sure two minutes ago. She looks
to Adukwu. They step to the body together as… Nantz approaches
Martinez.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What’s the plan, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Mission is still to get the civilians
to the Forward Operating Base. We’ve got a battalion there, all that
firepower… I was thinking, I saw a bus couple of blocks back on
11th…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Maybe we should stay on foot. Martinez
looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to ‘Santa Monica Airport’ on
it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: The FOB is here, at the airport…
That’s miles to cover with those kids… And those bombs are gonna drop in
a little more than an hour. We’ve got to move fast.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We have no radio contact, nothing to let
us know the best route to take… And a bus is a big target.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: I made the call, Sergeant. It’s my
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs recon
on a.bus. It was abandoned two blocks south off 11th…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: If it runs, get it back here.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Can you hotwire a bus?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: He’s from Jersey, sergeant. A nod from
Nantz on this.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Stavrou, Harris…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: .you’re clear down 11th Street. They
exchange a quick glance.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Every day a holiday, buddy…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: .every meal a feast. They slip outside,
running off silently.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Well, Lieutenant, I’m a medic,
Dr. McDermott’s a vet… We weren’t sure who was most qualified to cut
this thing open. Martinez smiles.</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Look. It’s been surgically modified… He
pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien’s ‘gun’ is attached to its
arm.</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Part of its arm has been amputated to fit
this weapon.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Talk about commitment to cause. Adukwu
examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the alien’s ‘heart’
would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: What is that thing?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: He’s from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not a
different solar system. Nantz looks over at Imlay.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Thank you, private. Adukwu twists the
cap. It comes free, revealing… A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid
seeping from it.. Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Whoa, that stinks! Everyone steps back
except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she takes her scalpel, makes an
INCISION across the organ.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: I’m gonna puke. Swear to God, I’m gonna
puke!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Whatever you do, do it quietly,
Imlay.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Hey, Stavs…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Relax. First thing I wired was a
school bus. Trying to impress this Betty. She had a huge rack…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Enemy scout. Move your ass. Stavrou
doesn’t look up. Just works diligently.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Don’t rush genius.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Shit. You seeing what I’m seeing?
Correggio pulls BINOCULARS…</p>
<p><strong>pov through binoculars</strong>: A SIDE STREET, TREES
overhanging it.</p>
<p>****: Harris. Movement, 1500 meters up 11th. Suddenly, a loud BANG
rings out below them.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: What the hell was that?! They exchange
glances with the other marines across the roof. All four move quickly,
converging on one side of the building, look down the side of it… An
EXTERIOR DOOR leading into the center is BROKEN OPEN.</p>
<p><strong>the organ back.</strong>: Something vaguely METALLIC is
revealed within it. As Michele touches her scalpel to it, it SPARKS.
Then starts rhythmically GLOWING.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Looks like it’s receiving a signal…
Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding, contracting. Nantz
sees the ALIEN’S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm TWITCHING, spreading
through the alien’s body like a seizure.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: This thing’s still alive! Nantz pulls
his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO THE ORGAN, twisting
viciously.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Not so hard to kill when you know where
to aim. Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: Lieutenant. There’s a breach.</p>
<p>****: They in the building?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: No clue, Sergeant. An exterior door
was broken open.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather the
civilians in the gym.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Good idea, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Harris, hostiles advancing right at
you. Approximately two hundred meters and closing…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Done! Stavrou hops into the driver’s
seat, tries to start the bus. It doesn’t turn over. Harris and Stavrou
exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops below the wheel again…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: We’re in it together, Sergeant.
Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: C’mon, Mottola. Get that bus here!
Mottola is on the radio, frantic:</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: Where the hell is that bus?!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Get this thing started.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Hey, why didn’t I think a’ that?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re out of time! Martinez looks INTO
THE GYM, sees the kids staring back.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Go! Get ’em out! Imlay swings the GYM
DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out.</p>
<p><strong>in the lobby</strong>: Nantz and Martinez stand together,
aiming at the hall as… A final BANG… We hear a door being BURST
OPEN.</p>
<p><strong>they spin onto lincoln boulevard.</strong>: Screech to a halt
at the obstacle course of BATTLE WRECKAGE strewn across the street.
Noxious BLACK SMOKE is rising from BURNING HUMVEES and TRUCKS. Smoking
CRATERS pothole the street.</p>
<p>****: Jesus Christ. Those alien ships took the whole line out.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’ve got forty minutes ’til they level
this area.</p>
<p>****: Get us to the Forward Operating Base. Fast. Stavrou lays on the
gas, speeding away as, in the back, the other marines stare out. Mottola
peers into the sky…’</p>
<p><strong>pvt. mottola</strong>: Where the hell are all our jets?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Why the hell’d the lieutenant wanna take
a bus? We’re sittin’ ducks.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: The call’s been made, private. You so
eager to decide the fate of all these people? Imlay is stone silent.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Didn’t think so. Then Nantz looks up,
meeting eyes with Martinez as… A NOISE in the distance now. A low
VIBRATION, building. Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the
front. LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach… The
VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Everybody get down, weapons inside the
bus. Make no noise. The men pull their guns in from the windows,
crouching as low as possible, straining to see, hear… The vibrations
grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly… WHOOSH! An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead.
Then another, and another, and another… All heading east. The image of
their speed, their power, their other- worldliness is overwhelming,
devastating. Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies
on. Leaving them behind. Until… Suddenly, Mottola’s RADIO BLARES!</p>
<p>****: All stations this net, urgent traffic. Multiple enemy aircraft
moving east… As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see… One
ALIEN SHIP split from the armada, TURN BACK TO THE BUS.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: It’s coming back…! The children
scream, marines agitated… all hear a low vibration, echoing off
buildings, heading their way.</p>
<p>****: Kill that radio! Mottola turns off the radio. The alien
aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: They’re tracking our signals! All
radios, cell phones– keep everything off! Everyone stares silently,
tensely. Then… A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien
craft. Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But still
heading their way.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: It’s still coming… It’s searching…
Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO. He looks around the bus, sees the little
girl, Kirsten, ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair thing?
She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: My… pony holder? Nantz nods. She pulls the
PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair, hands it to Nantz. He smiles. Briefly.
Heads to the front.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Anything happens, Lieutenant, get the
SAWS up front and take off with these kids.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Sergeant…</p>
<p>****: It’s gonna be okay, it’s gonna be okay, it’s all gonna be okay.
Everyone freezes as the BEAM reflects off the walls, filling the space
with a horrible bright light, exposing them as…</p>
<p><strong>nantz fires the grenade.</strong>: The GAS PUMP EXPLODES! A
MASSIVE FIREBALL HITS THE ALIEN</p>
<p><strong>craft!</strong>: Nantz flattens himself to the street as… The
ALIEN AIRCRAFT, trailing smoke and flames, thunders out of control RIGHT
OVER HIM… Then CRASHES into a building… BLOWING APART!</p>
<p>****: That ship was an unmanned drone, lieutenant. And that alien we
cut open had something in it receiving signals… They must have one
helluva command and control center. Martinez pulls his map out, eyes
Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: That was some real John Wayne shit,
Sergeant. Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Don’t do it again. We work as a team,
Sergeant. We clear? Beat. Nantz nods.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re clear, Lieutenant. Nearby, Imlay
whispers to Mottola:</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Who’s John Wayne? Martinez looks up from
the map, turns to Stavrou.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts half
the distance off our drive.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Sir. We get on that freeway, we’ll be
exposed…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: It doesn’t seem like we’re much safer
out here. We’ve got two shitty options– I’m choosing the one that gets
us there fastest. We don’t want to be in this area when the bombs start
to fall.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p>****: Double time, Corporal. The bus barrels forward, careening
BETWEEN CARS, knocking some out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Take the next exit. Head south. We’re
two clicks from the FOB. The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea
of abandoned cars, heading to the off-ramp. Nantz appears uneasy. They
are exposed on this freeway and he doesn’t like it. He MOVES TO THE
BACK, peering out windows, checking angles. Michele looks up as he
passes, sees a GASH on Nantz’ head.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: Your head, Sergeant. You’re bleeding. Nantz
touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on his pants. Michele
smiles at him softly.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: Bet when you woke up this morning, you
didn’t think your day would end up like this.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: That’s a pretty safe bet.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Hostiles. Back up. Now, go! Stavrou guns
the BUS BACKWARDS, knocking abandoned cars out of the way…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Guess you were right, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Incoming! Down! Down! Down! A
projectile EXPLODES next to the bus! Sending CARS FLYING! SHRAPNEL TEARS
A GIANT HOLE through the side of the bus. TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are
instantly killed, blown clear out of the hole. Civilians screaming…
Stavrou hits the gas, BACKING THE BUS UP the best he can. An
ILLUMINATION heading toward them… BOOM! Another projectile DESTROYS AN
OVERPASS behind the bus! Trapped. And ALIENS are STREAMING AT THEM in
the distance. Stavrou works the shift, grinding gears, gunning the bus…
BEHIND A CONCRETE DIVIDER close by the COLLAPSED OFF-RAMP. The off-ramp
now dangles precariously: a 15-foot cliff-face of missile-scarred
concrete and re-bar. Martinez looks over to Nantz, not sure what to
do…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Let’s dismount, set up a perimeter, get
the civilians down to the street.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure
the street! Kerns, Adukwu, help get the civilians off the freeway.
Stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off-ramp.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Harris, Imlay, give us overwatch up on
the roof. The rest of you push out 20 meters, set up a perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: And don’t forget, aim chest, right!
Imlay joins Harris, SMASHING THE SKYLIGHT out of the bus roof, CLIMBING
OUT, taking position on the bus’ roof. The rest of the marines EXIT THE
BUS. Nantz grabs Adukwu.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Stay here with the civilians. As soon as
Stavrou gives the sign, get them down to the street! Adukwu nods. Nantz
starts off the bus.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Are we gonna die? Nantz turns back to
Hector. Manages a smile.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Course not, kid, we’re the good guys.
And Nantz is off the bus.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: I got about three dozen hostiles, twelve
o’clock. 300 meters now. Coming fast.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Prepare to repel. Fix bayonets! This
might get up-close and personal! Just a low CLATTERING now, the
battle-rattle of Nantz and his men fixing BAYONETS to their rifles.
Nantz-yells out:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Cpl. Harris!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Being vastly outnumbered provides a
marine rifleman with what?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: A target rich environment, sir!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Marines. We stand here. Let these
bastards know who they’re fucking with.</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Okay, it’s clear. We’re gonna go. Amy and
Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries the girls to the
door of the bus as Kern runs up.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll be right behind you. Adukwu
picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: It’s gonna be scary but we can do it,
okay? An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back window!
The girls scream. Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls…
Rincon grabs Hector. He and Michele follow…</p>
<p><strong>running across the freeway…</strong>: To the off-ramp. It
seems like a long way off. They run past Correggio, rocking a SAW full
auto. The FIRE is deafening.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Come on!! Come on!! Get some! Rincon
and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look up… They’re getting
closer and closer to the off-ramp as… Alien rounds blow chunks of
concrete off the roadway… UP AHEAD, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to
the EDGE OF THE RAMP, hurrying to get them down as… Rincon and Michele
REACH THE OFF-RAMP now. Kerns grabs Hector, HELPING HIM ANGLE DOWN THE
OFF-RAMP, getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as…</p>
<p><strong>bang! mottola takes a round to the side.</strong>: Rincon
spins, sees the marine drop, SCREAMING. Rincon looks back at Adukwu, who
is busy getting Michele down the off-ramp now. Then Rincon looks back to
the freeway, sees Mottola writhing in agony. Rincon runs to Mottola,
kneeling next to him. Mottola looks up at Rincon, fear in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: It’s okay, son. I got you.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: What do I need to know? The slightest beat,
then…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: It’s set to fire in three round bursts.
We’re low, so don’t waste your shots. Rincon holds the M-16 against his
shoulder, aiming.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: Just sight down the barrel…?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: And give ’em hell. Rincon sights down
the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in the distance. He squeezes the
trigger…</p>
<p><strong>by the freeway off-ramp</strong>: Adukwu sees Rincon and the
wounded Mottola now. He runs to them, incoming rounds WHIZZ by as…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. adukwu</strong>: Keep fighting! Rincon snaps back, turns
to fire… A moment too late as… THUMP! Rincon is HIT. He falls. Adukwu
grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian’s eyes. Adukwu rips
open packages of QuickClot, begins spreading the fast-clotting powder on
Rincon’s wounds as…,</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Shit, Lieutenant, we’re gonna be
overrun !</p>
<p><strong>by the bus / on freeway</strong>: Nantz and Martinez exchange
a desperate glance on this. Then Nantz. looks around, assessing the
situation.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Gimme two of your smoke cannisters!
Martinez pops two canisters off, hands them to Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Take someone to cover you!. Nantz
turns, sees Correggio. Then he turns the other way, sees Kerns.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Kerns! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Me, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I’m not worried about fightin’ next to
you, Kerns. Now let’s go. A slight smile from Kerns on this as he
follows Nantz… Who sprints low, scurrying between cars… 10… 20… 30 yards
closer to the enemy. Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV. Kerns ducks
low, covering Nantz. Nantz crouches, opens the gas tank… Unscrews the
fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the canister aside… pulls the
pin… flips the ‘spoon’ off…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Get ready to move on my word. Nantz
holds the fuse over the open gas cap.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Now! Nantz drops the fuse into the gas
tank. They go RUNNING BACK TOWARD THE BUS as… B0000M! The SUV EXPLODES
in a ball of flames! Nantz and Kerns dive BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE, Kerns
crouching, laying cover fire. Nantz pulls a fuse.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Again! Ready?!</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Ready! Nantz drops the fuse, they run…
The CAR EXPLODES in flames! Nantz runs to ANOTHER CAR, making sure Kerns
is with him.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Damn, Sergeant sure as shit’s ninja. He
just gave us a kill zone, didn’t he, Corporal?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Soon as they come through, blow ’em
back to hell! The first alien appears THROUGH THE BURNING CORRIDOR.
Imlay blows it away! Harris blows away the next… It’s working!;.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: Pull the men back… Pull ’em all back
now, Sergeant. I’m gonna stay and cover.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta here.
No way we’re leavin’ you…</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: I said I got it…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I’m not leaving you here to die.</p>
<p><strong>lt. martinez</strong>: That’s not your call, Sergeant. Now
get your men outta here… He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos
slowing down for him. He reaches into his vest… Martinez hands the
LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment between them. Nantz nods, then
spins, moving, yelling to the men.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re pulling back. Head to the lower
street, now! NOW! Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp,
laying cover as the men head down. Harris and Imlay slide down off the
roof of the bus, joining the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio
sees… MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing their
fire.</p>
<p>****: What about the lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Keep movin’, corporal! Go! All the men
climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back to get the Lieutenant
himself, sees… Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus.</p>
<p>****: This is Lieutenant Bennie Martinez’, U.S. Marine Corps! Aliens
converge toward the back of the bus. Ten… Fifteen… Twenty ALIENS heading
for the signal… Heading for Martinez.</p>
<p>****: 1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines! He turns, sees Nantz
coming back for him… Martinez pulls a smoke canister from his vest…
Holds it up for Nantz to see… Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas
cap of the bus…</p>
<p><strong>aliens close in on martinez…</strong>: Nantz turns, dives for
cover as… Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank… A flash of fear
across his face as… Aliens are on him as…</p>
<p><strong>kaboooooooooooom! the bus explodes in flames!</strong>:
Massive fire ball shooting 300 feet into the sky’! Nantz raises his
head, debris raining down, sees…</p>
<p><strong>all the aliens dead.</strong>: His eyes wide at Martinez’s
sacrifice, the burden now on him, he’s in charge of the men, the
civilians… Nantz gets to his feet. Runs for the off-ramp.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Package Mr. Rincon for transport. We’ve
got to move…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Sergeant. Did you just leave Lt.
Martinez back there?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Lt. Martinez stayed behind. He knew he
was dying…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: So you left him? Is that how it is
with you?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: He sacrificed himself to save our asses.
Now you get your head straight, Corporal. This is my unit now. Nantz
looks at the men, who stare back, shaken.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Let’s move. We need shelter… Those bombs
are gonna drop!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Tighten this place down. See if we can
establish communications. Hard line only! Nothing wireless.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Listen, we’re out of the bomb zone… But
when they fall, we will definitely be rocked. Make sure the kids are
prepared for that. Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward.as Imlay
and Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down. Nantz pulls blankets
from a nearby rack, covering Rincon. As he does, we see a glimpse of
Rincon’s BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING. He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips.
Hector stares into his father’s face, eyes filling. Rincon touches
Hector’s face lightly.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: It’ll be okay. We’ll get your dad fixed
up. But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can’t meet the boy’s
gaze. Hector can see this isn’t the truth.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: Listen to me, son. I’m not going to make it.
But you will.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t want to go without you.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: I know. But you have to. Now wait with
Michele a minute. Let me talk to the sergeant. Reluctantly, Hector
allows Michele to lead him away.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Mr. Rincon, we can take you and… Rincon
turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rincon</strong>: Don’t waste time, sergeant. You and I
both know what’s going on here.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I can’t leave you…</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: No. You can’t take me. Nantz is silent, at a
loss.</p>
<p><strong>across the store</strong>: Imlay stares at a CLOCK on the
wall, calls out:</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Four minutes and those bombs drop,
Sergeant. NANTZ looks over at this. But his expression is blank. He
turns back to Rincon, who’s staring straight into him.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: I keep playing it over in my head… If I’d
done things differently… Maybe I could have gotten Hector out
earlier.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You can’t look back. You make the best
decision you can… A beat.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: Just promise you’ll get my son out of here,
Sergeant. Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I promise. Rincon holds out his hand.
Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: I’m trusting you with the only thing I have
in this world. Nantz stares, nods.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Sergeant! Hard wire connection!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Damn, that’s Cherise… Harris quickly
types back a response: ‘you ok?’ The message comes back: no, real
scared.’ Harris responds: ‘where are you?’ He hits SEND. But the message
doesn’t go through. He clicks the mouse. But the computer has frozen.
Then ‘Internet Connection Lost’ pops up on screen. Everyone stares.
Harris stands, walks from the computer. Stavrou watches him go as…</p>
<p><strong>across the big 5 floor</strong>: HECTOR steps back to his
dad’s side. Rincon’s eyes open slowly. He looks at Hector. Manages a
small smile. Reaches out, wipes a tear from his son’s face.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: I’m very proud of you, son. You’re being so
brave… Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him
tightly.</p>
<p><strong>rincon</strong>: I love you, Hector. Mr. Rincon smiles. His
face peaceful. Hector is silent, tears rolling down his face.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Thirty seconds!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Get away from the windows! Get those
kids behind cover! The marines back away from the windows into the
center of the store, hunkering down with the civilians. Everyone stares
at the CLOCK on the wall as it ticks…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: C’mon. Fry those bastards…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Those bombs drop, then everything’s
gonna change. Get to the FOB, get some goddamn ammo…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Some goddamn food…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Some goddamn tanks. Beat. Everyone
stares as… The CLOCK ticks to NINE…</p>
<p><strong>and nothing happens.</strong>: They wait. Fear grows on
everyone’s faces.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: They shoulda’ dropped, right? We’d feel
it from here, wouldn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: That much ordinance? They’d feel it
in Nevada. Something’s wrong…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Maybe it’s good… Maybe we turned the
tide…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Yeah, right, Imlay… ‘Cause we were
kickin’ ass out there.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: What’s happening, Sergeant? What’s that
mean?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. adukwu</strong>: Sergeant… Mr. Rincon is dead. Nantz
turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father. It’s all too
much…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Jesus… Nantz takes a deep breath, his
mind racing, the world closing in on him. He turns to Michele.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Listen, our Forward Operating Base is
about a mile away. We have to go on foot. I’ll need your help with
Hector now. Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector. Nantz
kneels by the boy.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I’m sorry Hector. Your dad… didn’t make
it. You understand? Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear,
looks up at Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t wanna be here. I want my dad back. I
want it all to go back to the way it was before…</p>
<p><strong>at. the front of the store.</strong>: Stavrou, eyes on the
still street, sees… TWO ALIEN SCOUTS appear. They crouch by a car.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Sergeant, we got hostiles in front.
All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised. But Nantz,
tearing up himself, just stays focused on Hector.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Me too, Hector. I wish it could go back,
too…</p>
<p><strong>stavrou looks out to the street</strong>: MORE ALIENS appear
now, moving TOWARD THE STORE.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Out of time, sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>nantz</strong>: Tries to lead Hector away. Hector
struggles.</p>
<p>****: We have to go, Hector.</p>
<p>****: No! No! I want my dad!!! Nantz lifts Hector. We see Hector’s
face, stricken, staring back at his father as he’s carried off. The
other marines gather up Michele and the girls… And everyone is moving
silently THROUGH THE STORE as…</p>
<p><strong>at the front of the store</strong>: CRASH! The plate glass
window is SHATTERED as… An ALIEN smashes through it. The alien is very
still, peering around. Then it begins to creep forward as… A SECOND
ALIEN, then a third, a FOURTH follows, leaping into the store with
sinewy power.</p>
<p><strong>at the rear of the store</strong>: Nantz peers out a BACK
DOOR. It’s clear. They MOVE OUT just as… MORE ALIENS leap in. They move
in formation THROUGH THE STORE as… THE BACK DOOR silently shuts.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Stavrou, Harris.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Yes, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Blow something up.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Yes, Sergeant. As the others RACE AWAY
down the alley… Stavrou takes his rifle butt, SMASHES the WINDOW of a
nearby CAR. Reaches in… Jams the car’s gear into.neutral. As the massive
Stavrou pushes the car AGAINST THE STORE’S</p>
<p><strong>back door…</strong>: Harris pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE.
Harris.slides UNDER THE CAR… Punctures the GAS TANK. As Harris rolls
away from the FLOW OF GASOLINE… Stavrou LIGHTS it. Both men RUN DOWN THE
ALLEY.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Don’t think they’ll be comin’ out that
way… As… BOOM! The car, blocking the door, goes up in FLAMES.</p>
<p><strong>down the alley</strong>: Stavrou and Harris FALL BEHIND A
BUILDING with the others. NANTZ, still holding Hector, looks off to a
SIDE STREET..He signals to Kerns and Correggio.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Check it out. The two marines run down
the alley to the SIDE STREET. Nantz sets Hector down. Looks the boy in
the face.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: This is the hardest thing you’ll ever
have to do… Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: But we’ll get through it together. I
promise, Hector. Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance
with Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him. Nantz steps away as
Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting:</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Looks good, both directions. Out of
earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with fiery
intensity.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We are not losing one more of these
civilians. Period. Am I making myself clear?</p>
<p>****: Let’s move. The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: You okay, bro?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: I hadn’t a pushed Cherise to get
married, she’d still be in Chicago. Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised.
The squad halts as… A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING. The marines FALL
BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down with them as the RUMBLING
continues to BUILD.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Under the cars! Now! The marines
frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE CARS with the
civilians, pulling the kids under as…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: How far, sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: One block over. Imlay smiles at
Kerns.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: We’.re gonna make it! Dude, we’re gonna
make it… But as they approach a CORNER… Nantz stops, exchanges a glance
with his corporals.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: The smell. An ominous beat. The squad
moves down the dark street as… ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky… Like a
beautiful early winter snow…</p>
<p><strong>santa monica airport.</strong>: As they approach the Forward
Operating Base, the devastation is slowly revealed: CRASHED F-18 JETS
and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways. BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE
VEHICLES litter the airfield.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Jesus… They wiped our Forward Operating
Base right off the map.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Now we know why those bombs never
dropped. They took our jets out.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: This was a dug-in marine Corps
position that had armor, air and ground. Maybe we got nothing left to
fight with… Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us
everything–</p>
<p><strong>they’re losing this war.</strong>: Nantz turns, spies an
AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Let’s get under cover. Now.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Lock this place down. The marines fan
out, securing doors, checking windows as… Nantz kneels by Hector, tries
to comfort him.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You’re a brave kid. When this is over,
you’re going to be a hero.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: People always say that. “He’s a hero.”</p>
<p>****: No one even knows what a hero is.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Your dad was a hero. Hector just stares
back.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that freeway.
Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes between them…
One man died so another could live…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: You save a marine under fire, you get a
medal, y’know. Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on
it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: This is our medallion. It’s yours. For
your dad.</p>
<p>****: You’re 2/5 now, Hector. Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks
it over, pointing to the 2/5 MOTTO on it:</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What’s that mean, “retreat hell?”</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: During World War I, an officer from our
regiment was ordered to retreat. He said, “Retreat? Hell, we just got
here!” Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now. Harris calls
out:</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: We’re secure, sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Listen up. We need ammo. Kerns, Adukwu
stay with the civilians. The rest of us, let’s move. Nantz puts a hand
on Hector’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Sorry, bro. He moves on to another
fallen marine, searching.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Sorry, bro. Across the runway, Nantz
pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead marine. Then looking up, he
sees…</p>
<p><strong>a lav-25 armored personnel carrier. intact.</strong>: Nantz
moves to it. Then turns. A LOW WHISTLE from him and the marines look up.
They hustle to Nantz. Everyone gives the LAV an excited once-over.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Looks like it just rolled off the
goddamn assembly line!</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Good job, Sergeant!</p>
<p>****: Can you drive this thing?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Hell, if it’s got an engine, sergeant,
I can drive it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Good. Get it running.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Seems like vehicles are targets…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: A minivan’s a target, Correggio. A LAV
with a Bushmaster chaingun… That’s an asset. Imlay grins. Nantz motions
to him, starting off.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>****: Me? Where, sergeant? Nantz points to the CONTROL TOWER, its
windows blown out.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: High ground. We need to see the big
picture.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: My dad’s a fireman. They love their ice
cream. Used to visit the firehouse with my little brother, they always
had tons of it… My brother’s not much older than these guys.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: You don’t look much older, either. She
gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: Is this day ever going to end?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Maybe the Sergeant’ll find a way outta
here.</p>
<p>****: What’s with you guys anyway? Doesn’t anybody have a first
name?</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Emmanuel. Manny.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Pete. You married? Family?</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: I’m single. Lots of family back in
Nebraska, though… Hopefully they’re safe… She shakes the thought
away.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: What about you guys?</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Little Rock.</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Nigeria. I came here to be a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>michele</strong>: You should be a surgeon, the way you cut
into that thing… Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks
around.</p>
<p><strong>adukwu</strong>: Yeah. Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Look how far east they’ve gotten. That’s
almost the whole city… Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS: Sees the
HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills… Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops
when he sees one quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY
BLACK. Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What the hell’s that? Imlay peers
out.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: There’s zero activity there. And the
area does seem completely devoid of activity– No alien or human aircraft
above it. Like a DEAD ZONE.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: What are we gonna do, Sergeant? Nantz,
panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF in the distance
now. Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then looks
back to where he saw the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: That must be the alternate extraction
site. Maybe we can evacuate the civilians there… He turns to Imlay.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Get them in the LAV. I’ll radio for an
evac helicopter… When I do, they’ll be coming, so we have to move
fast.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Think we can make it, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re gonna give it one helluva try,
Imlay. He reassures the young marine with each-word:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re not dying here.</p>
<p><strong>control tower - santa monica airport - minutes
later</strong>: Nantz standing alone with a RADIO PACK looking out into
the black night, wind blowing through the tower. The LAV WAITS ON THE
TARMAC below, engine running. Nantz takes a deep breath. Presses the
button on the RADIO.</p>
<p>****: Any station, this is Foxtrot 2 November. I have four civilians
and seven marines, we’re heading to Alternate Extraction Point Charlie.
Requesting evacuation. I say again, this is Foxtrot 2 November heading
to Alternate Extraction Point Charlie. Out. Nantz turns immediately,
hurrying out.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Use the thermal sight. No lights.
Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs…</p>
<p><strong>into the turret</strong>: He mans the M-240 MACHINE GUN.
Imlay beside him on the 25MM</p>
<p><strong>bushmaster chain gun.</strong>: Headlights off, running dark,
Stavrou drives, peering through the THERMAL SIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>stavrou’s pov through thermal</strong>: Washed green, the
city a war zone, massive destruction.. An ALIEN DRONE winging toward the
airport as…</p>
<p><strong>in the turret</strong>: Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Extract site’s only a couple more miles,
Imlay. Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to…</p>
<p><strong>stavrou, behind the wheel…</strong>: Eyes focusing tensely
through the thermal sight scope.</p>
<p><strong>thermal sight pov</strong>: Green wash of the city passing
by. Tall, empty buildings all around… Suddenly, a big DARK OBJECT in the
street! Stavrou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Civilians and marines in the tight
passenger compartment are thrown around. Right in front of the LAV… A
massive CRATER. The street’s impassable.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We gotta go around. The LAV backs up,
Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240 machine gun, trying to see
out into the darkness… Then they TURN A CORNER… And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO
TALL BUILDINGS is harrowing… FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering… Then
turning. Flying toward them.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Get ready, Imlay. Here they come.
Stavrou looks out to see… A HELICOPTER in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Think I see our ride, sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>sgt nantz</strong>: Get us there. Cause we’re about to get
lit up. The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200
meters out when…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: See what that Bushmaster can do, Imlay!
Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Come on, you martian bastards! The
Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a minute, each
capable of destroying a light tank. For once, the aliens are
overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster… One
goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind buildings.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Where’d they go? Where’d they go? Nantz
is scanning the sky, then…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Imlay, on your six! Imlay spins in the
turret, picking up… The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back
around. The lead alien ship FIRES! A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV.
Imlay rocks in the turret.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Son of a… Imlay targets, fires the
Bushmaster… The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A
SECOND SHIP. The TWO SHIPS EXPLODE into a building as… The FINAL ALIEN
AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight at the LAV…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Getting close, Imlay…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: I got it. Imlay FIRES a burst. The last
aircraft is hit…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Stand on it, Stavrou! Stavrou pushes it,
TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage… Which is almost on top of the LAV
as… Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping. The wreckage explodes into
a building behind them as… THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a
UH-1’Medevac ECHOES.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: The chopper! Nantz looks out, sees the
CHOPPER LANDING in the street. The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and
SMOKE.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Last stop!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Everybody out! The marines rush the
civilians OUT OF THE LAV… Nantz and Imlay scrambling out last.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Pretty decent shooting, Imlay.</p>
<p>****: Goddamn, you did it, sergeant! We’re gonna get these people
out!</p>
<p><strong>everyone runs to the chopper.</strong>: The marines begin
loading the civilians in, the old-school CREW CHIEF hopping off to help
the kids in.</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: You are in the middle of the shit,
Sergeant! Everything’s been pulled back.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: We’ve lost most of our air assets. We’re
abandoning Los Angeles. This city’s done…! Let’s go! The chopper powers
up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others.</p>
<p><strong>the black dead zone shimmering nearby</strong>: Nantz watches
the HELICOPTER BANK TOWARD THE BLACK ZONE. But as it gets closer… The
HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude. The kids
SCREAM. The marines hang on. Nantz sees the PILOT STRUGGLING with the
controls. The HELICOPTER’S GAUGES are going crazy. The pilot BANKS HARD
AWAY from the area, reversing course. And the helicopter STABILIZES.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What the hell happened?!</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: Something there was playing hell with
our power! Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him. He
sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector’s hand. Sees the words
“Retreat Hell.” Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of
cityscape. Then he turns to the crew chief.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Set us back down!</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: What?! The other marines in Nantz’ unit
look over, alarmed now.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We need to recon that area!</p>
<p><strong>crew chief</strong>: We can’t land! May not have power to
take off again… Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF.
He points to it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Then we’ll rope down!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: What the hell, sergeant? What’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: There’s something over there… We could
be the only ones left here to figure out what it is. Let’s go, marines.
The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull themselves up.
ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it hovers over the building…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: NOW! Go! Go! The marines start to RAPPEL
DOWN, one after another as… Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: They’ll get you safe. He smiles at the
girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a hand on his shoulder. A
BEAT.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: See you soon, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We’re gonna fight. Nantz turns, grabs a
ROPE, drops out of the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: Why’d we get off the chopper,
Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: ’Cause we have a job to do.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: But we were getting out…!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: You have some hunch and now we’re
stuck out here in the shit?!</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: That’s right. This fight’s not over.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Sergeant’s gonna get us killed! Just
like my brother. A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It’s laid open now.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Believe me, Correggio, I grieved for
every marine I ever lost… Nantz looks around now, from marine to
marine.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: But we are in the fight of our lives
right now. And our duty is to keep moving forward. Keep fighting. That’s
how we honor men like your brother, Correggio. And Lt. Martinez. And
Hector’s father, who saved Adukwu’s life. He wasn’t trained for that. He
just picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done. If a civilian can
do that…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I need you men. And maybe we’ll die
fighting today. Not because we’re heroes. But because we’re goddamn
United States marines, and always will be.</p>
<p>****: I’m willing to give my full measure for you. I’m hoping you’ll
do the same for me. A BEAT, glances exchanged. THEN ALL THE MARINES RISE
AS ONE.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Sergeant. We’ll follow you to hell and
back. Nantz smiles, nods.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Good. ’Cause that’s where we’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Laser target, sir?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Might have to get some cruise missiles
in here.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Shit, yes, Sergeant.</p>
<p>****: Hostiles. Twelve o’clock. Nantz looks up to see… ALIEN SOLDIERS
appearing on the street now. Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got
plenty of armor. Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see… The
aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as… Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE
pinging off the LAV’s armor as… SPLAT!!!</p>
<p><strong>stavrou mows through the enemy line.</strong>: Nantz looks
out the back to see some ALIENS STAGGERING AWAY.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Reverse, Corporal.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Aye, aye, Sergeant. As he BACKS UP,
mowing back over the remaining aliens… The marines cheer.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: Losing power, Sergeant. Gauges are
dropping… losing voltage… The LAV slows. The engine skips. Then the LAV
DIES.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Stavrou?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: She’s dead, Sergeant. Nantz looks
around, warily. The streets are quiet, deserted.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: All right, dismount. Grab anything you
think we can use. The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Hot as hell here.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: No lights.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. adukwu</strong>: My watch stopped.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Something’s generating heat. Messing
with our electronics. Sucking up all the power… Nantz scans the street.
The sweat dripping into his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Where would you put a critical asset if
you wanted to protect it? Or hide it?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Underground. Nantz points to A SUBWAY
ENTRANCE AHEAD.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch the
street. Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance. Nantz
motions to the others.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Let’s go. Nantz leads Stavrou,
Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the stopped escalator to the SUBWAY
PLATFORM. Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform.
Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is dark, the only
light bleeding in from the street above. He motions Stavrou to guard
against anything coming from above. Then he moves forward with the
others. A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train
tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly. Nantz sees a DOOR in
the tunnel wall, heads to it. He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the
blade into the door jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio
and Kerns.</p>
<p>****: You two stay here, watch our backs.</p>
<p>****: Imlay, come with me. Nantz and Imlay slip through the
doorway.</p>
<p>****: No. Save it. Something is killing anything electronic we use.
Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see… A dim light ahead.
Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very slowly. Turn a corner, see… A
STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS fiercely, as if
it’s shining through the floor. Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals
Imlay to stay put. Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of
light. As he approaches, he realizes it’s coming through… An IRON GRATE
in the floor. Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO…</p>
<p><strong>a massive subway tunnel</strong>: Fifty feet wide, the dim
tunnel has been further EXCAVATED. It is a huge CAVERN now, extending
off into the distance further than Nantz can see. The huge space is
illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY. An ELECTRIC HUM FILLS THE AIR.
Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the others. One of
the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz. Nantz spins, runs back
into the darkness. Calling to Imlay:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Run, Imlay! Run! BANG. The iron GRATE
FLIES into the air.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: Hard to tell. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I think I got their attention. Nantz
kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the case marked
GLTD.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Look. There’s something big down in the
tunnels. It’s sucking up a lot of power, could be a major Command
&amp;.Control asset.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: We need to destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. kerns</strong>: But we got no jets left, right,
Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Hopefully, they can still fire cruise
missiles from Pendleton or Vandenburg… I’ll radio in a strike, paint the
target from the street. You know what that means. The man nod
solemnly.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: We gotta hold ’em off long enough to
paint the target.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. stavrou</strong>: If we can get a transmission out
before the radio dies…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. harris</strong>: And the targeting laser lasts long
enough for command to get a lock on the target.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Hell, dying’s easy, ladies.
Everything else takes balls, right? They all laugh softly.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Let’s do it. He takes a deep breath,
raises the radio, and TRANSMITS:</p>
<p>****: Any station, this is Foxtrot 2 November. Priority Fire Mission.
I have identified a major enemy command and control asset– located grid
459083. 1 WILL BE LASING.</p>
<p><strong>command</strong>: Foxtrot 2. You have visual confirmation of
this C&amp;C asset? We can’t waste resources.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Affirmative. They’re building a huge
complex underground… I think it’s the head of the snake. Repeat. I will
be…</p>
<p><strong>the radio goes dead.</strong>: Alien fire EXPLODES now,
rocking the station. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Nantz and the marines cover their
heads as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall. The
walls crack. Dust fills the air. Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete
FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE. Then, it’s over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING
in PAIN, strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS.
The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet. He slings
his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his bad ankle to the
stairs. Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is only
a small opening of daylight near the ceiling. The men all unclip their
web gear, begin climbing.</p>
<p>****: Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Here they come! The marines FORM A
PERIMETER AROUND THE LASER, OPENING UP on the aliens as… The mass of
aliens surges forward like a wave.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Hold them back! We have to keep the
laser on target! Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another
target and FIRES. The alien staggers, keeps coming. Three more rounds
and the alien goes down. But the rest KEEP COMING… closing in…</p>
<p><strong>following the beam of the laser back to nantz.</strong>:
Nantz is picking his targets. AIMING, FIRING… Turning, finding targets,
reloading, the aliens getting closer… Then his rifle runs dry. NANTZ
pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing alien in its
‘heart.’ It drops. Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another
alien… Then the next. The next. Then his sidearm is out of bullets as…
An EXPLOSION rips near Nantz. Knocking the laser away. Nantz
struggles…TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as…</p>
<p><strong>more aliens pour into the street.</strong>: The marines are
pushed into a SMALL CIRCLE around the laser. Fighting nearly back to
back.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Did we get a lock!?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: I don’t know! Then… An ear-splitting
NOISE. The marines look up, see…</p>
<p><strong>a cruise missile coming straight down the street!</strong>:
Nantz looks up at his men, yelling:</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: INCOMING! Fall back! This way! Nantz and
his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do, trying to hold off the
aliens. Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is
there to help him up.</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Think you just twisted your ankle,.
sir. And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Don’t stop!! We’re too close to the
impact point!! The marines start running as…</p>
<p><strong>more cruise missiles appear, ripping toward the
ground…</strong>: BOOOOOM! The first missile strikes! Then another…and
another …BOOOOM! BOOOOM! A piercing WHISTLE sounds. Nantz looks into the
sky as… Suddenly KABOOOM!!! A 2000 pound laser-guided ARTILLERY SHELL
explodes INTO THE GROUND… THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of
fire and smoke erupting from beneath the surface.</p>
<p><strong>marines!</strong>: AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash,
standing tall.</p>
<p><strong>on me!</strong>: The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at
its center.</p>
<p><strong>fire!</strong>: They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING
AS ONE. The seven remaining marines POUR FIRE on the mass of aliens. The
Drone Ships fall from the sky, EXPLODING on the ground. The aliens, in
disarray, are mowed down. The rest FLEE. And as the smoke drifts away,
there is silence again. Nantz looks up to see…</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: You know what, Sergeant? My brother
said you were a bad ass.</p>
<p>****: I had no idea…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: Your brother was one helluva marine,
Correggio.</p>
<p>****: So are you.</p>
<p><strong>pvt. imlay</strong>: Man, it’s quiet.</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilot</strong>: They’re in full retreat throughout
Los Angeles, heading back into the ocean. Units are mopping up. On this,
Nantz turns to his SQUAD. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. nantz</strong>: This has been a hell of a battle. Plenty
of other battles to go. Everybody good with that? The marines don’t
hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>marines</strong>: Yes, Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>cpl. correggio</strong>: Well, uh, actually, Sergeant…
there’s this girl I was supposed to meet up with tonight…</p>
<p>****: I’m sure she’ll understand. Nantz looks at his marines.</p>
<p><strong>nantz</strong>: I think you men earned the right to call
yourselves marines today. I’m damn proud of every one of you.
Retreat!?</p>
