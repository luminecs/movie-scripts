<p><strong>byron</strong>: You, Zack?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I’m Byron. Nice to meet you. C’mon. Let’s go
get your luggage.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Take that coat off. This is the
Philippines.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: How was the flight? They take care of you
okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your
mom. That’s pretty rough. I would’ve returned your call a lot sooner but
I was out at sea…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I been calling for four months.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Well, that’s how long I’ve been out at
sea.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: This is it. This is where I live.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: If I were in port more, I’d rent a better
place, but this works out okay.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I thought you girls were gonna do some
shopping. Tiki, Maria… I want you to meet my son.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: This is it. This is where I live. I suppose
you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I’m not finished. I’ll only be in port one
week a month and when I’m here you’d never catch me playing daddy with
you ’cause it’s not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I’d be
better off in that state school back in Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I ain’t never going back to that school,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you.
This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and
nobody’s gonna make me change.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t care about that. I just ain’t going
back. You don’t want me? Okay. I’ll find me another place.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Hey, come back.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Come back here, kid!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Okay, okay. You win.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Thank you, sir!</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Stop calling me ’sir! I ain’t no officer. My
name is Byron.</p>
<p><strong>tiki</strong>: Hot shot jet jockeys. Maybe you grow up like
that, fly mach five, no jive.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Here, kid. Put this in your shoe in case you
need it.</p>
<p><strong>1st filipino boy</strong>: Hey, palequero. You new in the
P.I.?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah. I’ve been here a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>2nd filipino boy</strong>: Wanna see some nice things, guy?
We could show you around. Nobody knows this shithole like us.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sure. I guess it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>1st filipino boy</strong>: Hey, big spender. Give us some
money.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t have any money.</p>
<p><strong>1st filipino boy</strong>: Bullshit! Get it out!!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Shore Patrol! Shore Patrol! Open up!!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hi, Byron.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Zack, you little shit! You haven’t changed a
bit!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Neither have you, pard!</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn’t he
beautiful? You should’ve called!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I
graduated. I got my degree.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I thought you quit school. Last I heard you
were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah, I made some money down there, then I
talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn’t magna cum
laude but I did okay. You should’ve seen me in my cap and gown.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Why the fuck didn’t you invite me? I would’ve
come.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Get on the phone, honey. Call up your friend…
Gloria… Gloria big tits. We’re gonna celebrate! You hear that? My son’s
graduated from college!</p>
<p><strong>1st prostitute</strong>: Are you guys really father and son?
You’re putting us on, right?</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Right. We’re putting you on. What happened to
that joint?</p>
<p><strong>2nd prostitute</strong>: I think it went out.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Ay, palequero.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long
time, only ten dolla.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: What’re you looking at? Hand me that
towel.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Hey, that was pretty great wasn’t it? Not as
great as that night with the three stewardesses in Manila… but pretty
fucking nice.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: So what’re you doing in Seattle?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Get ready pard. This one’s gonna blow you
away.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me,
pard, not after some of the shit you’ve pulled.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I joined the Navy.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: You… in the Navy?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s right. I’m on my way over to this
officer school in Port Ranier.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in
the world. You gotta come and visit me. I’m only a couple hours
away.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Who gave you this idea?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Nobody. It just came to me.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I don’t believe this! You… in the Navy… an
officer… that’s like me saying I’m running for fucking president. Hey,
man, look at you! Hey, officers don’t have tattoos!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Look, I Ill be seeing you, Pard. Take
care.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Don’t be pissed. I’m on your side, Pard. I
just don’t want you to do something you’ll regret. You gotta give six
years to the Navy if you wanna fly… that’s six years with the most
uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren’t like you and me,
man. It’s another breed.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You afraid you’ll have to salute me,
Chief?</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as
dumb as that?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t know. That’s just how it sounded.
Well, I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly
bullshit? A big pat on the back?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the
graduation present.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Hey, Zackie – don’t go away mad.</p>
<p><strong>ext. an area near the gates of port ranier naval air station
-</strong>: DAY</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: Why would a girl who looks like that go into
the military?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Hey, this is the modern Navy.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Fall in! Form a line, you slimey worms! Heels
on that chalk line! Attin-hut!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Now when I say “understand” I want the whole
group to say, “Yes, sir!” Understand?</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Louder!</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Yes, sir!!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t believe what I’m seeing! Where’ve you
been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad
mouthing your country, I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy
enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision!
Understand?!</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I know why most of you are here. We’re not
stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United
Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot
of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six
years. If you’re too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy
village where there might be women and children, I’m gonna find that
out. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hi, son.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: How’re you doing, Sarge?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What did you call me, boy?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I called you Sarge.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Before that.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I didn’t call you anything before that.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You said, ‘How’re you?’ I am not a ‘ewe,’
boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Lauder, Sweet Pea!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is
that why you called me a ‘ewe’? Are you a queer?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Where are you from, boy?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers
and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don’t see any horns so you must be
a queer.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you’re giving me
a hard on!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’d better stop eyeballing me, boy, or I’ll
rip your eyes out and skull-fuck you to death!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What’s your name, boy?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I
didn’t know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Not exactly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Where’d you get this, Mayo? This is really
wonder work.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I thought I recognized the work. Be proud of
those wings. They’re the only ones you’re gonna leave here with,
Mayo-naise.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hmmmm… Emiliano Santos Della-Serra. You a
college boy, Della-Serra?</p>
<p><strong>della-serra</strong>: Yes, sir! I graduated with honors from
Texas Tech, sir! Math major, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You don’t say. See this cane, Della- Serra?
See these little notches near the handle? There’s a notch for every
college puke like you, Della-Serra, who I got to D.O.R. – drop on
request – from this program. And the first one I want to carve out of
this class is you, Emiliano.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I expect to lose half of you before I’m
finished.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I will use every means at my disposal, fair
or unfair, to trip you up, expose your weaknesses… as a potential
aviator… and as a human being. The price at the other end is a flight
education worth one million dollars, but first you have to get past me.
Lay your suitcases open for inspection!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Seeger, are we going to have to watch you run
around in these for the next thirteen weeks?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Some girls will do almost anything to get
laid. Are you one of those girls, Seeger? Did you put in for AOCS to get
gang-banged, Seeger?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Sir, you can yell at me if that’s what you’re
supposed to do, sir. But you have no right to insult me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’ll call you a beaver sandwich, if I want
to, until the day they commission you an officer and a gentleman and I
have to call you ‘sir’!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: My language offend you, Seeger? Well, maybe
the Navy’s not for you ’cause you’ll hear far worse out in the fleet?
You’ve got five seconds to put your suitcases in order and prepare to
move out. Time’s up. Attin-shut! Left-humph! Fo-wud-harch!</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Come on, guys. It’s five o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: One more minute.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: ’Bye, Mom, see you later. C’mon, Lynette,
before she asks when I’ll be home.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Now this is my idea of an ass bandit. Wait
’til some of our local girls get a look at you, scrotum head.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You think that’s funny, Worley? Let me tell
you something. Not all the obstacles that can trip you up are on this
base. As long as there’s been Navy base here there’s been what you might
as well call your Puget Sound Debs, poor girls who come across the sound
on the ferry every weekend for only one reason, to marry themselves a
Naval aviator.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Now a Puget Deb will tell you, ‘Honey, don’t
y’all worry ’bout no contraceptives. I got that all taken care of.’
Well, don’t you believe a word of it, Sweet Pea…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: …’cause a Puget Deb will do anything and say
anything to trap you… and once she has you by the balls, child, you
might just find yourself with a couple of income tax deductions you
didn’t have when you came here.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I know this all sounds silly to you,
especially in this so-called modern age…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: …but you scuzzy college pukes had better
watch out, ’cause they’re out there. And you, Sweet Pea, are the answer
to their dreams.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: How do you like my Poopie Factory, Seeger?
You enter these doors and individual with a look that’s all yours, a
style, a way about you, a personality… and you come out a Poopie! That’s
sort of like what happens to food. It goes in looking all fancy and
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I knew those commercials were full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: This is where you live, children! This is
Poopie-ville! Girl Poopies to the left, boy Poopies to the right!</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: How do you figure that’s your bunk?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: He said it’s up to us and I got here first,
didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your
Poopie suits!</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: You’re a married man, huh, Perryman?</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: Yeah. They’re the main reason I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: I still can’t believe I did this. A
three-point-eight average from Amhearst and I signed up for this?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I’m a service brat, pal. Same as you.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Someday you’ll have to tell me about Subic.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: That Foley looks like he’s been through a war
or two.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’ve seen better.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Fall out! Fall out!!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Think there’s any truth to what he was saying
about those girls? Is that still going on?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should’ve warned
you ‘scuzzy’ female types about the ‘Puget Dudes.’ They’ll tell you
they’re wearing a rubber but they’ve bit a little hole in the end.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: You’re pretty funny, Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Maybe we’ll be roommates, Seeger, and you’ll
find out how funny I really am…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Seeger, Mayo and Worley – hit the deck and
give me fifty push-ups. On the double!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Looks like you need a little work on your
upper body strength, Seeger.</p>
<p><strong>nellie</strong>: Paula, honey, Lynette… I hope you didn’t
call all this way just to bring me these nice records.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: No, ma’am. We planned on stopping at the
‘O’ Club tonight, one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Look at that hot little blonde!</p>
<p><strong>nellie</strong>: ’Bye girls, and thank you again. Blue Angels
be in next month. You want me to line you up with one, just let me
know.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Far fucking out! I’ve been wanting to meet
one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might
overhear.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Paula, look at the new Poopies.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yeah, I saw ’em. Poor guys.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: See you in a month when you get
liberty!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Don’t worry. It grows out about an inch by
them.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Hi, Donny.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Oh, hi, Lynette. Hey, Paula, haven’t seen you
for a while. When’re we gonna go out?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I already told you. I don’t go out with guys
who’ve been dating a good friend. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Count off!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Daydreaming about your wife and kids,
Perryman? You want to join ’em now?</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Count off!! From the top.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I’m so hungry I could die.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Okay! You got thirty-five seconds to get that
garbage in your belly, bus your dishes, and get your asses out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Flying low and feeling mean. Spot a family by
a stream. Pickle a pear and hear’em scream. ’Cause napalm sticks to
kids.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Eighteen kids in a free fire zone. Books
under arms, just walking on home. Last kid walks home alone. ’Cause
napalm sticks to kids.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Hey, Seeger, what’re you doing in this
program?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: What’s the matter, Worley? Am I threatening
you?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your
ass shot down.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Don’t lose any sleep over it. I wouldn’t mind
being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Great. You can go in my place.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Are you really going for jets?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Uh-huh. All the way.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: How about you, Mayo?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Jets.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of
every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Here’s my favorite one now. See if it ain’t
your favorite, too. Family of gooks sittin’ in a ditch, Baby sucking on
her mama’s tit. Dow Chemical don’t give a shit, that napalm sticks to
kids.</p>

<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s you in thirteen weeks, those of you
who survive. Don’t you dare look at them! You’re not worthy enough to
look at them! Della-Serra, I saw you eyeballing them!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What the fuck’re you doing, Topper?</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: I’m afraid to go out there, Zack. I know
he’ll catch me. He sleeps in the head, you know.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: He doesn’t sleep in the head, man. He just
says those things. Shit! I just cleaned that sink this morning!</p>
<p><strong>della-serra</strong>: Another week or two, you’ll have that
ducktail back, Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey! I worked on it for thirty minutes!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Good morning, girls.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Ever heard of knocking, mayo?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed
last night. Survival of the fittest.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: The whole world’s a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog
eat dog down to the last one, right?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies,
Seeger.</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: Inspection’s in five minutes, Mayo! Give ’em
to me.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Where’s your money?</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: You’d better hope Foley never finds out
about that, Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that
shine! Boonies’ll cost you five.</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: Who’s got two bucks? It’s costing me every
penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that
motel.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Who you got doing all that for you, man? Some
enlisted guy?</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you’re
making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on
an honor violation?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t notice anyone else complaining.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I can tell you right now you’re not gonna
make it, Seeger. First, I can’t graduate you unless you make it over
that wall. You gotta have muscles, Seeger, if you want to fly my
jets.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I’ll make it over the wall, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Do you want to be a man, Seeger? Is that why
you’re here?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Sir, if it means getting all the respect a
man gets, then yes! I was told I could find that in the modern Navy,
sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s it! That’s exactly what’ll beat you,
Seeger… your mental attitude as a person of the female persuasion. Under
all your bullshit, you still think like a second class citizen, Seeger.
You could never give orders to men.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: So that’s how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Not if you make it worth my while. How about
free boonies for the duration?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: How about you kiss my ass?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Look, Zack. It’s them. Holy shit. Look at that
bodacious set of ta- tas.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Mrs. Rufferwell, ma’am, think you could
introduce us to these attractive young ladies…?</p>
<p><strong>nellie</strong>: Officer Candidate Sid Worley, may I present
Miss Lynette Pomeroy. Miss Paula Pokrifki, Officer Candidate Zackary
Mayo. Well, I hope you have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You told us it would grow out an inch.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: It’s grown out more than an inch,
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That was you guys, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Come on. Let’s go dance.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Is this you boys first night of liberty
since you got here?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yes, ma’am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice
for my country… for my people… for you. But I survived.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But
the rest is all wop.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh
Fleet.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah. We’ve lived all over the world.
Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Really? I’ve never been out of Washington
except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean,
over at Portland. Ain’t it pathetic the way folks talk around here?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You’re putting me on, aren’t you? We don’t
got no Navy bases in Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You got a girl?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, and I’m not looking for one either.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yeah, what are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I hear most of the girls who come to these
things are looking for a husband.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah? Why’re you here?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: To meet interesting people, improve myself.
You wouldn’t believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Do you go to school?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No. I work for National Paper. It’s a good
job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour. When I get enough money saved, I
plan to go on to college.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: You been through the Dilbert Dunker
yet?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went
through it and made it, so I know I can.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Is your brother a flyer?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: He was. He died.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Vietnam?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I had a big brother who died over there,
too. He wasn’t no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps
type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don’t remember much about
him.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about
something else?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: We don’t have to talk at all.</p>
<p><strong>donny</strong>: Hey, PAULA. How about a dance later on.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Well… I’m kinda with someone.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Think you’ll make it all the way to getting
your wings?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are
dropping out like flies.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Just think ‘I’m gonna do it!’ Program
yourself. See yourself making it. It’ll happen. I know ’cause I just
read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You’re a very pretty girl, Paula.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Let’s flee this pit stop, what do you
say?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Something tells me you’ve been here before.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Now what on earth would give you an idea
like that?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You’re sure it’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll respect you
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You’re crazy, girl. You’ll respect me. That’s
great. But what I meant…</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I told you. I’m on the pill. Don’t worry,
Sid. Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Could you believe those girls!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: ‘Nellie’s Nymphos!’</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put
her up wet.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Look out, Foley! I’m ready to take you on for
another week!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Hurry, Lynette. It’s almost midnight.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I got my foot on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Well, it you’re not gonna ask, then I will.
How was it?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an
incredible body.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yeah… Mmmm…</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: What did he do? Did he do anything that was
different?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Everything was different.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: But in what ways?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Did you… come?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: How did it go with you guys?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Big Sid came in about two and a half
seconds, then had the nerve to ask, ‘Did you make it, too,
sweetheart?’</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: …but I really like him, Paula. And I know
he’s going to make it. He comes from a family of pilots.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: He ask you out for next weekend?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: No, but I told him I’d be at the Town
Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The
fifth week’s supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he’ll be
wishing he took my number.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: You hope.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: He’ll show. I’d bet my paycheck on it.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: See you at church in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Paula, come in here, please.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Come over here. I want to look at you.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I know I’m late and I’m sorry, but
Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I said, come here!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Daddy, I don’t want to get into anything with
you tonight. I’m tired and I…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What are you tired from?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Joe!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Come over here where I can see you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Look at the sand! Enough sand to start your own
beach! What’s that wet place on your dress?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I don’t know what it is. It could be
anything.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But you knew right off what I was talking
about, didn’t you, Paula! Did you let that boy –</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Don’t you dare ask me that question. I’m an
adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like
that!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, as long as you live in this house, young
lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Uh-uh! Not a chance! There’s nobody in this
town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is
nothing. If I can’t have more out of life than that, I’d rather be
dead!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Do you honestly think you’ll find a boy in
that… that officer’s school who’s serious about marriage?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yes I do!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Then you’re dumber than I thought! All you’ll
get from their kind is pregnant!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Nothing like that’s ever gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Esther, do you think she’s using… …birth
control?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Yes, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: When did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: A long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Look at Foley! Can you believe it!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m the base martial arts instructor, so
those of you in on-eight must desist in thinking of me as their drill
instructor for the next sixty minutes. Just think of me as… the enemy.
Incidentally, children, I am wearing the uniform of a Viet Cong foot
soldier I killed in hand-to-hand combat in Plei Me, Viet Nam… when I was
about your age. Maybe a little younger. May I please have a volunteer?
How ’bout you, Daniels?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Go put him in the hospital, kid.</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: He can’t touch me. That’s the law.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hello, pussy. How bad do you want to
survive?</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: Sir, this Officer Candidate doesn’t
understand what you’re asking, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Let me see if I can improve your
comprehension.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Do you want to survive bad enough to stop me,
pussy? Or are you relying on my generosity, my love of humanity, to stop
me from killing you?!</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: Please… no… I can’t breathe…</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: You… had… no right! You can’t… touch… us!
It’s the… law!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: ‘Sir, this Officer Candidate doesn’t
understand what you mean by survival.’ Now do you understand a little
better, pussy? Get out of my sight!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You think I’m a little harsh on your
classmate? Wait ’til you get shot down behind enemy lines and the only
thing between you and a POW camp is what you assholes learned from me!
Okay, worms. Now that I’ve got your attention, we can begin.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, baby… c’mere…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Nice haircut.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Kiss it, baby. Make it grow.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: So, when do you get off?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Take care of the customers, Doreen.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That’ll be two dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Nice, hospitable folks they get around here. I
hope she comes.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: She’ll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like
you oughta be a big catch around these parts.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Get off my case, Mayo. I didn’t grow up
rich.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I think we’re making some of the locals
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Who cares? Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the
Wop. Gee, I’m glad you’re here. I’ve been looking forward to this all
week.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: What would you girls like to do? Want to stick
around here for a little or… or could I suggest another plan…?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Like pick up some booze and go to a
motel?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Or we could do that yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I vote for the motel.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: My kinda group!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hey, make way for the warmongers.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What did you call us?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I called you a warmonger. Ain’t that what you
are?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hey, let me ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah, what do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Let’s get out of here Zack.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You come here for a couple of months – you
rich college boys – struttin’ around in your ice cream suits like you
own the goddamn place – fucking our best women… Hey, who do you think
gets left holding the bag after you’re off flying around the world?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, pard, why don’t you go back inside and
cool off.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hey, I’m not finished talking to you, sailor
boy!</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: God! I’ve never seen anything like that in
my whole life! Did you see that guy’s nose?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we
get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Well, excuse me for livin’!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Want a back rub? Might make you feel
better.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I shouldn’t have done that. I should’ve
walked.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: He didn’t give you much choice.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: There’s always a choice.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Where’d you learn to fight like that?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t feel like talking, if you don’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Opening up just a little wouldn’t kill you,
ya know.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay,
come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Where’s that coming from? I wouldn’t fuck now
if my life depended on it!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Forget it. Just get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I don’t know who you think you’re talking to!
I ain’t some whore you brought here! I’ve been trying to be your friend
and you treat me like shit!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Be a friend. Leave.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You got no manners and you never tell the
truth! You’re nothin’ special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at
all of being an officer!</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: A definite improvement.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You stayed after all.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Wrong. I’ve driven a hundred and twenty
miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty
Hail Mary’s since I saw you. Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I
am, what I want… so if even in the back of your –</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I know who you are and what you want.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What do you want, Paula? What do you really
want?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: To have a good time with you until you have
to go.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Mmmm. Last night was fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Zack, am I your fantasy?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me.
I ain’t gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me?
I’m like candy.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You’re better than candy.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m serious. It’s gonna be hard to get
enough.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Getting cocky, aren’t you? Huh, you little
Polack? Getting feisty on me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Zack, when you’re through with a girl, what
do you do? Do you say something or do you just… disappear?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’ve never had a girl.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I forgot to thank you for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Any time, sailor.</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Back in line. That was totally unsat,
Della-Serra!</p>
<p><strong>foley, standing pool side zack looks away from him and
gives</strong>: HIS THUMBS UP</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Think they’ll let us do that again? God, that
was fun!</p>
<p><strong>topper</strong>: Does this thing hit with the same impact as
an actual plane?</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: This is nothing compared to a plane.
Don’t forget to watch the bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: I’ll never get it polished in time. Give
me a buckle, Zack.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I can’t risk it.</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: You’d make it. He’s just getting to the
girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn’t take it if
he keeps me here over the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sorry, pard. Wouldn’t want you to get an honor
violation.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: In every class there’s a guy who thinks he’s
smarter than me. In this class, it’s you, isn’t it, Mayonnaise?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Report to my office in five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Come in, Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I want your D.O.R.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, sir. You can kick me out, but I’m not
quitting.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the
weekend’s out, you’ll quit.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Casey Jones was a son of a bitch. Drove his
train in a thirty-foot ditch. Came on out with his dick in his hand.
Said, ’Listen, ladies, I’m one helluva man. I went to his room and lined
up a hundred. Swore up and down he’d Having fun, Mayonnaise?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Look over there, Mayo. She stayed to do that
instead of going on liberty.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: She may not make it through the program, but
she’s got more heart and more character than you’ll ever have. I’ve seen
your college record. I’ve never heard of most of those schools. Tell me
something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did,
sir! Until this.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s a lie, Mayo. You’ve gone through a lot
worse, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Stop eyeballing me, mister! I’ve looked
through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know
about your mother. I know your old man’s an alcoholic and a whore
chaser. Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn’t it, Mayo?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’m doing okay, sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: No you’re not. You’re failing the big one,
baby, and I don’t just mean in here. I mean in life. I’ve watched you,
Mayo, and you don’t mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don’t
make friends, not the way the others do.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Want to know why I’m not an officer, Mayo?
Because I have a servile mentality from growing up poor… from always
being the kid on the windy side of the baker’s window. That’s your
problem, Mayo. That’s why you don’t mesh. Because deep down in that
bitter little heart of yours, you know these other boys and girls are
better than you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Shoulder arms! Port arms! Parade rest!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Hey, what do you say we call off this little
charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon’s…? Come on, man.
You’re about as close to being officer material as me.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sir, this candidate believes he’ll make a good
officer, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: No way, Mayo. You don’t give a shit about
anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it.
Think they’d trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly
in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who’d zip off one day in
my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sir, that’s not true! I love my country!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Let’s get down to it. Why would a slick
little hustler like you sign up for this kind of abuse?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I want to fly, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: That’s no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My
grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the
airlines?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I want to fly jets, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Why? Because you can do it alone?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What is it, the kicks? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t want to do something anybody can
do.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Pity you don’t have the character.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s not true, sir! I’ve changed a lot since
I’ve been here! And I’m gonna make it, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Not a fucking chance, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I got nothing else to fall back on. Sir! This
is it for me… and I’m gonna do it!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: All right, Mayo. Get on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Don’t give up the ship, Mayo!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Hang in there, Zack!</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Damn the torpedoes and remember the Tides
Inn Motel!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Mayo, are those your friends?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Maybe there’s hope for you yet.</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: I see you didn’t DOR, Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, Sid, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, you guys still awake?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, do you guys ever… feel like you don’t
belong here…?</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: Yeah. All week long.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: What’s the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally
starting to get to you?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Naw.</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: You know what he was running on me all
last week? He told me I wasn’t officer material because I think black
and I’d never get comfortable giving orders to whites.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Yeah? He’s been telling me I’m not officer
material because I’m not inner-directed. He thinks I’m here for my
folks… and for my brother.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That isn’t true, is it?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: How about that prick! He told me he wasn’t
officer material because he grew up poor like me.</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: He said he grew up poor?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: The kid on the windy side of the baker’s
window. That’s how he put it.</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: Foley’s not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four
told me he’s the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Oh yeah? Friend of mine in oh-two told me he
comes from a long line of Baptist ministers from Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: How about that prick!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That was great.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: It sure was.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Want me to get a towel?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’ll get it if you want.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I don’t want you to move.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t want to move. But somebody has to move
sometime. Eventually.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: They found them like that, shriveled up from
weeks without food or water…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: All week I kept thinking about you guys in
that sailboat.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: We were pretty drunk.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those
girls they’re letting in the flight program these days. God, I’d love to
fly.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What’s stopping you?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I don’t care what the magazines say… it’s
just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You
don’t know the junk I grew up listening to, ’bout the way women are
supposed to think and act.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s no excuse for not going after what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Who says I’m not going after what I want? My
mother’s thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory.
Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don’t want.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one
day while I was at school.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: God.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: The thing that really got to me… she didn’t
leave a note. Nothing. I’ve always hated her for that.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Does it still hurt?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Naw. You’re alone in this world no matter what
kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got
that one down.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I bet most people believe you when you feed
’em that line.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t sit with you.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I understand. Maybe we’ll see each other
after the show…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: How’re you doing, pard?</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Nobody. Just a girl I’ve been making it with
the last couple of weekends.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Great ass.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You
know what they call ’em, don’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call
’em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk –</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That what she was… a Norfolk Deb?</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Who? Aw shit, Zackie, let’s not get off on
your mother again, please.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What if I want to talk about her, pard? What
then? You know, that’s all I’ve ever heard from you, since I was a kid…
you never want to talk about that, man, and it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: There’s nothing to talk about. Two goddamn
times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s not how she told it. She said you wrote
her every week you were away.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I wrote. Not every week…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: She said you told her in every letter how much
you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her…</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I never said any of that!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I found them, pard, and read them myself,
right after she did it!</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Okay, I wrote those things… and yeah, I had
big thoughts of getting together with your mom… but when she hit me with
being pregnant, I saw who she was. I’d had quiff lay that shit on me
before!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What did you call her? What did I hear you
call her, you son of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: She loved you, you bastard! And she believed
you when you said you loved her! She never gave up thinking you’d come
back Don’t you ever talk about her like that again or I’ll kill you,
Byron!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Zack, wait.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’ve seen all that a hundred times.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, will you just leave me alone?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yeah, I’ll leave you alone! How about
forever? That long enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, isn’t it about time you had me over for
Sunday dinner?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a
family Sunday dinner’s been coming into my head. Since you’re the only
one I know around here with family…</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Zack, I don’t know if I want to do that…</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: C’mon, Paula. We’d better get back.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When’re you
gonna let me know?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: When I’m good and ready.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: What’s a matter, Sweet Pea? We’ll have a little
fuss?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: You serious about having him over?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I haven’t made up my mind.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Paula, how far would you go to catch
Zack?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: You know what I mean. Would you… let
yourself get pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No way… Would you?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I never used to think I’d do something like
that, but now I’m not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain’t long
enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That don’t justify trying to trap a boy by
getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can’t believe
you’re even thinking like that. I mean, that’s really backward.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: No more backward, if you ask me, than the
way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us. Don’t you ever feel
used, Paula? Don’t you ever feel like if this is all you get for your
trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it…?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No. I never feel like that.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: You look real pretty, darling. I’m sure
everything’ll go just fine.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Mom, I don’t want to be a fool. I like him a
whole lot but…</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Honey, you can only be yourself. If that
isn’t enough for Zack…</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: He’s very handsome.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Daddy, please be nice to him.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Are those for me?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, they’re for your mom.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Thanks again for the flowers, Zack.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: My pleasure, Mrs. Pokrifki.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: How many more weeks before you graduate,
Zack?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Just three, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sir, excuse me, but why’re you looking at me
like that?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Looking at you?</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: He doesn’t mean anything by it, Zack. Do
you, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t mean anything by it.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Great dinner! Mrs. Pokrifki. Absolutely the
best meal I’ve had in a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>esther</strong>: Oh… yes… thank you, Zack.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Come on, Zack. Let’s go for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn’t have
brought you here.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, it’s okay. It was a great free meal.
Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: That’s okay. I’m used to it.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: So, after you graduate you go on to basic
flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah, then if I get jets, it’s on to Beeville,
Texas.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Zack, do you ever think about what it’d be
like to have kids… a family.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No. Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Some day. When I’m sure I can do a better job
of it than my folks.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What would you do differently?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: For a start, I wouldn’t marry a man I wasn’t
in love with.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Why’d your mom marry that guy if she didn’t
love him?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Because my real father wouldn’t marry
her.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Your real father?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yeah… him.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Your real father was an Officer candidate like
me?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Twenty-two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No wonder he was looking at me like that.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Uh-oh. Time to get back to the wars.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Call me during the week if you get the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’ll try, but this week we go into survival
training, so I can’t make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner.
Thank your mom again for me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Sure. Zack, I hope you know I didn’t have to
show you that picture.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: See ya, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must’ve
set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did
it?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You’d better get smart, man. It’s time to walk
away.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: What? You’ve gotta be kidding!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Remember what Foley said? His little warning?
Those are the girls he was talking about. They’re out to marry us any
way they can.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I don’t believe that. They’re just having a
good time, same as us.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s what they want you to think, but I saw
where she lived, what is she’s trying to get away from. Just take my
word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I don’t know about you guys but I’m
starving.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Okay, worms. This is it. Can you pussies live
through three days without food or water in the wilderness? This is
where we thin our ranks the “natural” way, children. Incidentally, those
little twigs you see floating in those mud puddles aren’t twigs. They’re
water moccasins.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: You and Lynette still seeing those flight
candidates over to Pensacola?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Why? What makes you think we wouldn’t be?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I don’t know… Friday… three forty in the
afternoon and not a word out of you about where you’re going, what
you’re doing over the weekend…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Comes a time right after they get through
survival training when they start to think they can make it without you.
Suddenly they stop calling. Suddenly they own the goddamn world. He
hasn’t called you by now, Paula, he ain’t gonna call.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You just keep your mouth shut, Bunny. You
don’t know so much!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: May they all crash and burn.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Sid Worley, I think you’re ashamed of
me.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Ashamed? No – I love you, Lynette. I mean that.
After I leave them, I’ll meet you at the motel, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: If you won’t take me to dinner with your
parents, I won’t meet you at the motel.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Lynette, I told you already, it won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Then, I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Well, so much for that.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Lynette, did he say anything about Zack?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Cover for me while I make a call.</p>
<p><strong>o.o.d.</strong>: Hey, Mayo. There’s someone named Paula on
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Tell her I already split.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Zack’s only a tenth of a second off the
all-time obstacle course record. He’s bound to break it soon.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s wonderful, Zack.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Your son is the one reason I’m still in the
program, Mrs. Worley. He’s pulled me through every exam.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You guys are lucky you didn’t go through the
program when I did. They used to start that Dilbert Dunker twice as high
as they do now.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s really interesting, sir.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: And you couldn’t just quit like you can now.
When I went through it… and when my oldest boy went through it… if you
bilged out you were sent into the fleet as a swabby. Sid, how come you
haven’t written Susan in over three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: We haven’t had time to write anybody.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Zack, is my son involved with a local
girl?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No, ma’am. All he ever talks about is, us,
Susan.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Thanks for covering for me.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No problem, but who’s Susan?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: My girl back home. We’re supposed to get
married after I get my wings. She was Tommy’s girl. They were engaged to
be married before he died. I should’ve told you about her. I don’t know
why I didn’t, except I didn’t want you to think I was a shit for making
it with Lynette.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’m not your folks, man. You love this…
Susan?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: She’s the sweetest person I’ve ever known.
Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church.
Everybody loves her.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I didn’t ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked
if you loved her.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Listen, I’m not going to go to that little
reunion party. I’m meeting Lynette at the motel. Best head in fifty-two
states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You should’ve done what I did. A clean
break.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Lynette told me it really tore her up when you
didn’t call this week.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: There’s women for you, pard. They tell you
they’re in it for the laughs, but it’s always a fucking lie. Look out,
Trader Jon’s, I’m in the mood for some fun!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, guys – we did it. We survived!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Give me another double Tequila.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>della-serra</strong>: So women turn you on, huh, Seeger? I
always thought you were a dyke.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Cool it, Emiliano. I don’t find it funny.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Lemme show you little game called “Crash and
Burn”.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Listen up, dick-brains! This is how we
separate the jet jockeys from the helo-boys. Guy who flies the farthest
without crashing and burning… he’s hot shit!</p>
<p><strong>della-serra</strong>: Come on, Mayo! You’re gonna get our
asses in trouble, man!</p>
<p><strong>perryman</strong>: Get down from there, before they call the
shore patrol.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Come on! Give me a push! Never hochi in the
P.I. you see jet-jockey so hot like me!</p>
<p><strong>trader jon</strong>: Hey, buddy, cool it.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Zack, we’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison
is really starting to get to me. C’mon, Seeger. Gimme a push. Fuck you
guys! I’ll do it myself!</p>
<p><strong>trader jon</strong>: Okay, that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: You guys take care of Trader Jon while I get
him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: C’mon, Zack. We’ve got to get out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: C’mon, Seeger. Let’s go to the Tides Inn
Motel.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: You’re cute, Mayo, but you don’t want me. And
to tell you the truth, I don’t want you. See you back at the base.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: By the way, shouldn’t you have had a period by
now?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I’m a little late, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: How late?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: What difference does it make? If anything
was to happen, which I’m sure it isn’t, it would be my
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Exactly how late are you, Lynette?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant.
Just suppose it. You don’t think I’d try to make you do anything you
don’t want to, do you?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No. But that’s not the only issue here,
sweetheart. There’s a lot more to it than that.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: What other issue is there, Sid?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: My responsibility as its father, for one. I
mean, if I’ve made you pregnant, I’d want to… do the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: …I’d want to pay for the abortion… I’d want to
be with you through the whole thing… by your side. So how late are you,
Lynette?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Let’s just wait and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Zack? God, I’m glad I found you. I need to talk
to you, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Talk to me in the morning. I feel like
shit.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: But it can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Guess fucking what! Lynette’s missed her
period. What am I gonna do, Zack? What can I tell my folks?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No, but she’s gotta be at least a month
late.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Doesn’t mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You
can’t do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Fall out on the lawn in five minutes! This is
your last shot at the 101 Course… Mayo… Seeger… Della- Serra…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Sir, request permission to make an emergency
phone call, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Move it, Mayo!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>man,” “the wild wop,” (della-serra), “godzilla.” “what
me</strong>: WORRY?,” ETC. Across the back of Foley’s all red warmup
suit are these words: “YOU’RE PISSING ME OFF, BOY!”</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Come on, Seeger! Let’s go over it
together!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Go on, Zack! Go for the record!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do
exactly what I tell you. Start back ten yards and take off from here.
Not here… or there… but right here! No excuses, Seeger! You are going to
plant those legs here and then you’re going to yank yourself over that
wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: It’s a big religious thing with her and she
won’t even discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: But she expects you to marry her?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: She said it was up to me. If I don’t, she’ll go
off and have the baby on her own somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: So what’s the problem? Girls do that all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I can’t let her go off and have the kid by
herself and not do anything. If it’s my kid, too, then I’ve got a
responsibility, don’t I?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Not if she won’t even talk about an
abortion.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: But it would still be my kid. That’s the
point.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Do you know that for sure?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: It’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Okay, but what if it’s like Foley said and she
got knocked up, to trap you – is it still your responsibility?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead
and has it” Zack, there’ll be a child in the world that’s mine – and I
couldn’t go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where
it lived.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your
responsibility?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Your brother getting killed instead of you…
Isn’t that why you promised to marry this Susan? Isn’t that why you do
everything, man? Out of some bullshit code of ethics you inherited from
your family?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Maybe it’s all bullshit to you, but that’s now
how I was raised. I believe we have a responsibility to the people in
our lives – that that’s the only thing that separates us from the
goddamn animals! I’m not like you, Mayo. I can’t just shit on people and
then sleep like a baby all night!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You got a responsibility to you first, pard –
and if you can’t handle that, you’ve got bigger problems than getting a
girl pregnant!</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Now everybody take off your masks but
continue the same exercise. The purpose is to show you the effects of
altitude on the motor skills when you’ve been cut off from your
oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Stop this thing! I said stop it!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I want out! Let me out! Please! Let me out!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sid, it’s okay. Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sid, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I don’t know… I felt like… like I was
suffocating… Christ, Zack… I was so scared… so godddamn scared…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey, man, don’t cry… not in front of the
instructors.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I gotta do something.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You didn’t kick him out…? Wait, didn’t he tell
you what he’s been going through?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It doesn’t matter what he’s going through.
That’s the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for
some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can’t ever happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: But you don’t understand. There’s this girl
he’s gotten pregnant and she’s putting him through hell, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: He’s right, Zack. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Just like that it’s all over? With less than
two weeks to go, you’re out?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: It can still happen to you, too, Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Come back here, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What did you call me, Mayo?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Zack, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I thought the D.I.’s were supposed to help you
in this place! What kind of human being are you?</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you’re out!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Please, Zack – go back to the barracks!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t get it! He’s the best candidate in our
class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to
everybody! Couldn’t you bend your goddamn standards just a little?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Zack, it wasn’t him! He didn’t ask me to D.O.R.
I came to him on my own. I’m glad it’s over, Zack. I really mean that.
He was right. I wasn’t doing this for me.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sid, wait! Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: With your permission, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Is Paula here?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’m looking for Sid.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Paula, he DORed and nobody’s seen him.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Why’d he do it?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so
let’s not play any games, okay?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m not playing any games! Go look at
Lynette’s!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I don’t know where that is.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Hi, babe. Come on. I’ve got a couple of things
I want to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: What’re you doing out of uniform, Sid? You
don’t want to get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Forget that. Come on. Got a little
surprise…</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I can’t go like this. Can’t you wait a few
minutes ’til I’m ready?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: No way. I’m so happy I’m about to bust. Here,
honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Sid! Oh, it’s beautiful! You mean…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: That’s right. Let’s get married, Lynette. Let’s
find a justice of the peace and just do it!</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Let’s go tell Paula! God, I wonder where
we’ll be stationed first. I hope it’ll be Hawaii. I’ve always wanted to
go to Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: We’re not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I
DORed.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I had to, baby… I’m no aviator. I was faking
it, like I was with everything else in my life… up ’til right now.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: But… but what would we do? Where would we
go?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC
Penney’s. In a couple of years, I’ll be floor manager. Oh, you’re gonna
love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama’ll get along just great. Of course,
money will be a little tight for a while, but we’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Sid, there’s no baby.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I’m not pregnant. I got my period this
morning. There’s no baby, Sid.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Well, I’ll be goddamned.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: What do you say we get married anyway? I love
you, Lynette. I’m in love with you… and I didn’t realize it until right
this second… but I’ve never been happier in my life than I have been the
last seven weekends, never more relaxed… more loved for just who I am…
Marry me, Lynette. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: I’m sorry, Sid, but I don’t want to marry
you. I like you a lot and we had ourselves some real nice times, that’s
for sure… but I thought you understood. I want to marry a pilot, Sid. I
want to live part of my life overseas… the wife of an aviator, Sid. Damn
you! Goddamn you! Nobody DORs after eleven weeks! Nobody!</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Hey! Come back with my car!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Lynette??</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Lynette, where’s Sid?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Already come and gone. Can you believe it?
He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: What did you tell him about the baby?</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: That there isn’t one, as of today. I had my
period. I couldn’t believe it. He still wanted to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: And you turned him down??</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Of course. I don’t want no Okie from
Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You little bitch! How could you? Was there
ever a baby, Lynette? That’s all I want to know! Did you make up that
baby, Lynette? Did you??</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Of course there was a baby. I’d never lie
about something like that. Would I, Paula?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Lynette, did you make up that baby or didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: God help you, Lynette!</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: You’re no better than me, Paula! You’re
just the same!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: No! That’s not true!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’d like to come with you.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Because he’s my friend, too.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey, is this yours?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Ever seen this one?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: He’s here. She said he just came in.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sid, it’s Zack. Open up.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sid?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Oh, God… why? Why, Sid?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: You stupid, fucking Okie! Why’d you do it! Why
didn’t you talk to me first? Why didn’t you even try??</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Please stop it. None of that’s true.
Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket
out of here and you didn’t care who it was, any more than you cared with
the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through,
looking for a husband! Or the class before that!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Yeah. You got the whole story just right.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Beware of the Puget Debs – and we all laughed,
especially him.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn
term!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I bet you do!</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: However you got it figured, I didn’t kill Sid
and Lynette didn’t kill him! He killed himself!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: That’s brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you
didn’t kill him either.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Meyers.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Mayo, the rest of your class knows about
candidate Worley, and we’re all sorry.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Sir, this officer candidate requests
permission to speak to you in private.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’m busy, Mayo. It’ll have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: It’s important, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Mayo, you didn’t hear me – I said I I’m busy!
And so are you! Go get cleaned up!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Aw screw it…</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Martial arts demonstration in the old blimp
hangar in five minutes! Mayo, you’re my volunteer!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: What’re you waiting for, Mayo? Get your
scuzzy ass up here.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Put these on.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I’ll start with some basic kicks. You try to
copy me.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Looky-looky what we got. That’s pretty cute,
Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Get on your feet and find out how good,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Oldest trick in the book. Now, is there
anything you want to tell me, Mayo?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Byron, it’s me. You doing anything weekend
after next? Yeah… it’s graduation.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: What do you think of the new mechanics?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Today’s graduation. I hope he made it.</p>
<p><strong>seconds later, the camera is panning the face of
the</strong>: GRADUATES.</p>
<p><strong>the graduates</strong>: I do solemnly swear that I will
support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America
against all enemies foreign and domestic…</p>
<p><strong>the graduates</strong>: …that I will bear true faith and
allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any
mental reservation or purpose of evasion…</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: …that I will well and faithfully discharge the
duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.</p>
<p><strong>minutes later, the newly-commissioned officers have
broken</strong>: RANKS</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Look – my orders to Pensacola for basic flight
training… then it’s on to jets!</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: I knew you’d make it! Where’s your girl?
Didn’t she come?</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Naw. That’s over with.</p>
<p><strong>byron</strong>: Zackie, I’m so proud of you. Get ready,
’cause I’m gonna give you your first salute and you’ll owe me a silver
dollar. That’s the tradition, you know.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: No offense, Byron, but my first one’s gonna
come from… him.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Congratulations Ensign Seeger, sir!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Thank you, sir. I mean, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: I’ll never forget you as long as I live,
Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Well, goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: See you in the fleet, sir!</p>
<p><strong>zack</strong>: Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>foley</strong>: I don’t believe what I’m seeing! Look at all
that hair! All those lard bellies from junk food and pot! Where you been
all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing
your country, I bet.</p>
<p><strong>lynette</strong>: Way to go, Paula! Way to go!</p>
