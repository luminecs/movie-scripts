<p><strong>breakdown</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: How about it, Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Nice legs.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sniper.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: High-rise. Top floor. Window in the
middle.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Stay on him. Stay on him. Now go back to the
woman. Now!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Back to the sniper.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Stay tight on the sniper. Jesus – look at
him! He’s about fourteen! Don’t lose this!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He sees her.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Stay on her. If she runs, widen and try to
get her and sniper in the same frame.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I said he sees her.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I heard you. Stay on her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No… no…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sniper! Sniper! Sni–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: God, I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Let’s get out of here. Where’s your equipment?
Don’t tell me you checked it?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No camera?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No nothing?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Ah ha.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Couldn’t sleep?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I remember when you took that. We had fun on
that trip, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s nothing to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: C’mon, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I told you. I quit. Walked out. end of
story.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Whatever happened back there wasn’t your
responsibility. You can’t keep beating yourself up over it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What do you think? You could have stopped that
girl from getting killed?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It was different this time.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I talked to Reynolds. He thinks I could still
get the job at the San Diego station.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, Jeff, you didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Think of it. Low pressure, a steady paycheck.
So I shoot city council meetings – how bad could it be?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Is that what you really want – or are you just
running away?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who’s running? It’s good money, full benefits.
I’m tired of freelance. We could finally put some money in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You know I’ll never stand in your way. But
you’ve worked so hard. Are you sure you want to throw it away?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Throw what away? Don’t you get it? I don’t do
anything. I sit, I watch, I film – I let it happen.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re supposed to let it happen. It’s your
job.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, Amy. It’s my excuse.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That girl… it’s like I was paralyzed. I wanted
to do something, but I didn’t. I just stood there and watched her get
killed.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Please, babe, I need this. Say yes and we’ll
take as long as you want – drive cross-country and make a vacation out
of it. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jesus, Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sorry. I took my eyes off the road.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Maybe it’s time we took a break, you know?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’ll pull over next chance we get. Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: On vacation?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sort of. We’re moving, actually.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Whereabouts?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: California. We thought we’d take the scenic
route.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Huh. In that case, you oughta try the Pass
Road, ’bout thirty miles west. Real pretty, makes a loop through the
hills, then hooks back up with the highway.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Thanks. I’ll mention it to my husband.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Okay, then. Good luck. Enjoy the rest of
your trip.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nice car.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Air, C.D., leather – I guess you sprung for
the whole nine yards.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Then again, out here, what you really need’s a
C.B. radio.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: ’Course, if you use a C.B., you gotta have a
handle.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: How about Shit-for-Brains? You damn near
killed us back there, boy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look, I’m sorry, I didn’t see you. You pulled
out in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: The hell I did. I saw what happened.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How about if we just forget it, okay? I’m
sorry it happened. I don’t want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah. I bet you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Howdy, ma’am. Caught this fellow tryin’ to
steal your Cherokee.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to
hit him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: C’mon, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You want me to drive?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Later. Just get in.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, let’s just go.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This isn’t the Grand Prix, you know.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I told you. Nothing. The guy was an
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’d you get?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon
pies… can you believe they still make this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You kidding. It’s probably gourmet cuisine
around here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: This is crazy. Look at this. Says if you win
this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or
ninety thousand doughnuts.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What would you do with ninety thousand
doughnuts?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I dunno… Sell ’em for thirty cents each and
pay off this car.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Very funny. Alright, what about ninety thousand
dollars? What would you do with that?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know. Look, Amy, I’m not –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sonofabitch!! My camera! He stole my
camera!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The redneck at the gas station! He lifted it
right under my nose! My brand new Nikon. Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Should we go back?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s the use. He’s probably halfway to
Bumblefuck now, the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look, maybe if we call the cops –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nothing. I –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hang on – I can’t steer!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Found your camera.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I said I’m fine, okay?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Out of range?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s going on, Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s it look like? I’m trying to fix the
car.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Not the car.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s going on with you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s been a month since you got back. You can’t
keep shutting me out like this.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff, I’m talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look, I really don’t want to go into this
right now. I’m changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we’re stuck
in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Christ, not these guys…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Asshole…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You folks all right?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah. Our car broke down.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I figured that much. You want a hand pushing it
off the road?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thanks, I’d appreciate it. Amy, you want to
steer?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Think you could radio a tow truck for us?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I sure would if I could, mister, but my C.B.
blew a fuse this morning. I’m waiting till I hit the truck stop on I-40
to get it fixed.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How far is that?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: About 60 miles.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’d offer to take a look, but it’s hard to say
with these new engines. Used to be, you could give ’em a kick and a
holler and they’d start right up. Now it’s all computers and chips.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s a new car.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That could be the problem. You been running it
pretty fast?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell you what. If you want a ride, there’s a
little diner up the road. Belle’s. They got a pay phone. You could call
a tow truck from there.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nice of you to offer. But we’ve got a lot of
stuff in the car. I think we’re better off waiting for a cop to come
along.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Suit yourself. Not many cops on this road,
that’s why the truckers use it. Maybe you’ll get lucky. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We don’t know this guy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: He’s offering to help. It could be hours before
anyone else comes along. It’s 100 degrees. You really want to be stuck
out here?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy, I’ve got my equipment in the car. All our
stuff. What if those guys come back and we’re not here? Jesus… don’t be
stupid…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop
when we already have a ride.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving
Boston.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Excuse me? Do you think you could drop me at
that diner?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sure thing. How about you, mister? I could take
you both just as easy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That’s okay. My husband wants to stay with the
car. I’ll just get my purse.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m going to the diner. I’m going to call a tow
truck. Then I’m going to order an iced tea and wait. Good-bye, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You’re not riding with that guy. End of
story.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You wanted to be alone. Well… you’re alone. Why
don’t you take the time to get your head together?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Watch your step, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh for Christ’s sake…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I was supposed to meet my wife here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing
a pale blue Benetton shirt.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: A pale blue what?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Benetton shirt.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hank! Your order’s ready. I been busy.
They come and go.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It would’ve been within the last half hour.
She might’ve been with a trucker?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: A trucker.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Guy with a baseball cap. Driving an eighteen
wheeler.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Don’t ring a bell.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey! Man here’s looking for his wife,
dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin’ with a guy in a baseball cap.
Anybody see ’em?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Could she have left a message with another one
of your employees?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Don’t see how. I’m the only one who works
here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t understand. Is there another Belle’s
Diner?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: No siree. Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Excuse me, how far is the next town?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: About twenty miles.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look, if my wife comes in – her name is Amy –
tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move.
Would you do that, please?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: C’mon, you fat-ass. Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Pull over! Pull over!</p>
<p>****: Throughout this scene, various cars and trucks</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Jesus, pal, what the hell you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I was signaling you to stop. Didn’t you see
me?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where’s my wife?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: My wife. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How should I know where your wife is?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I checked at the diner. No one saw her
there.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Mister, I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop
her at Belle’s diner.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Nope. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How can you not remember? It was just half an
hour ago, for chrissakes!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Mister, I never seen you before in my life.</p>
<p><strong>cb voice</strong>: Breaker, breaker – Iron Man, you copy?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Your radio works – What the hell are you doing
– ?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy? Amy?! You in there?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Look, mister, I don’t know what you want, but
–</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What
have you done to her?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Officer, I need your help!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know, this guy has my wife!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Calm down, sir. Tell me what’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know what the hell’s going on. Last
time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he’s saying he’s
never seen her!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Officer, he’s crazy – I don’t know what he’s
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t lie, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: All right – everybody just calm down.
Sir, you want to tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help
us, said he’d drive my wife to a pay phone. But she never showed up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t know, officer. I’m driving along,
suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his
wife. I swear, I never seen the guy before.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: And you didn’t give his wife a
ride?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s lying!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Sir, all right with you if I search
your truck?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hell yes, officer. Go right ahead. Name’s Red,
by the way. Red Barr. My permits are all current. You can check ’em
out.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: That won’t be necessary yet. Just
stand back behind the line. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: All right, let’s see your license and
registration.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: What are you hauling today,
Mr. Barr?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Nothing, empty load. I’m heading to Fresno for
a pick up – ball bearings or something.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Long way to go empty.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell me about it. Too much competition
nowadays. One horse guys like me gotta drive halfway ‘cross the country
just to get a payin’ job.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Are we gonna keep looking or what?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Yes, we are. Sir, I’m gonna have to
see everything.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No problem. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Those yours?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes and whatnot. You
want to take a look?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: No. I think we’re pretty much done
here. You’re free to go.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Whoa, whoa – wait a sec. That’s it? You’re not
going to question him anymore?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Sir, I searched the truck. There’s no
evidence of suspicious activity, no sign of struggle.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Look, I don’t mean to butt in, but maybe you
got my truck confused with someone else’s.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Go to hell, you sonofabitch –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Hey! Hey! You want to get arrested?
Now the man has a point. This is a plain-looking, John Doe truck. Maybe
you did get them mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Mr. Taylor, either you come down from
there or I’m going to have to arrest you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It was him. It was this truck.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you get a
license plate?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: What about the information on the door
panel. You recall any of that?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I wasn’t paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance have
a beef with your wife today?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Well, for starters, maybe she left
you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t believe this…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: I’ve seen it a hundred times. Lovers,
married couples, gay guys. You put two people in a car long enough,
they’ll go at it. Hell, I’ve even seen men dump their women on the side
of the road, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: My wife did not leave me.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Officer, I’m sorry, I’d like to stay and help,
but I really got to make it to Fresno…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: I understand. Go ahead, sir. I
appreciate your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: This is insane. You’re just going to let him
go?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: I’ve got his information. If we need
to find him later, we’ll know where to look.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Much obliged. Good luck findin’ your wife,
mister. No hard feelings.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Sir, I believe you that your wife is
missing. Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you
had a fight – you don’t have to tell me. The point is I’m trying to
help.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: The town of Brackett’s 31 miles that
way. My deputy’s name is Len Carver. He’s a good man. He’ll help you
fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife
missing.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: If you want my opinion, your wife is
probably around here. Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare.
Either way, she’ll turn up.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Sheriff, this is dispatch.
Mrs. Gilbert’s locked out of her trailer again. Can you respond?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: 10-4, dispatch. Tell her I’m on my
way.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I want your name and badge number.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93. This
really isn’t necessary –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t tell me what’s necessary, goddamnit. I’m
noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>deputy carver</strong>: Is this a recent picture?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Two months old.</p>
<p><strong>deputy carver</strong>: She still wear her hair like
that?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>deputy carver</strong>: We’ll certainly do our best,
Mr. Taylor. There’s over a hundred thousand people go missing in this
country every year. Runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks hiding from
the I.R.S. – all vanishing without a trace.</p>
<p><strong>deputy carver</strong>: Now I’m not saying she’s one of them.
I sure hope not. But unless there’s a ransom demand or evidence of
forced abduction, believe me, the F.B.I. won’t even look at your case
till it’s been 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>deputy carver</strong>: Nevertheless, we’ll sure keep our
eyes peeled. How’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did she come in?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Didn’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You didn’t see her, or she didn’t come in?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Buddy, I told you the last time. I’m
busy. Maybe she came in, maybe she didn’t. All I know is, I didn’t see
her.</p>
<p><strong>barfly</strong>: None of my business, mister. But if I was
you I’d take a look in the ladies room.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy?</p>
<p><strong>flo</strong>: Hey – what the hell you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I want to see your order slips.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You write down the names. I want to see
them.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What are you, nuts? I don’t have to show
you jack shit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: If my wife came in here, then her name’s in
that pile.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You calling me a liar?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Mister, I’ve had just about enough of
you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Let me see the fucking slips.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Now, mister, you’re going to have to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Please, I need the phone – I have to call the
police!</p>
<p><strong>sluggish man</strong>: My name’s Billy. You the feller
lookin’ for his wife?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How’d you know? Did you see her?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Please, if you know something, anything, tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I seen her… maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What? When?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh man. Never shoulda opened my damn mouth.
Now I’m gonna git it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No one’s going to hurt you, Billy. Just tell
me what you saw.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: She came in on a truck. A big white one.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Then she… she got in another truck.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Another truck? With who?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They say I’m a
dummy, but I ain’t. I see things.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do you know where they went?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh-huh. Route seven. Up by the river.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where by the river?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dunno. They don’t tell me that kind of
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who doesn’t? The bartender? The men in the
truck?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I ain’t talking to you no more.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Billy, I need you to come to the police. If
you tell them what you saw, they’ll be able to help me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Man, you’re the dummy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t you git it? The police is the ones in
on it!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: C’mon… work, goddammit…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello, Steve? It’s Jeff Taylor… Listen, I –
don’t put me on hold! I need a favor… I’ve gotta talk to that friend of
yours at the F.B.I… No, it’s about Amy, she’s missing –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I said Amy’s been –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes, I’m still here. No – don’t call back –
Steve?! Steve?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Out of the car! Put your hands where I can see
’em!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I said get out, dammit! Now!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Sonofabitch…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Goddammit…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He’s getting away!</p>
<p><strong>driver of van</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He’s in the water! I just saw him!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: … can’t believe you let him get away…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You try chasing… through this shit…</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Fuck… this is what happens when you get one
without the other…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He coming around?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Should be… I clocked him pretty good…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Rise and shine, dad.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: C’mon, shake a leg.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Give us some answers and you might find out.
According to her, you’ve got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in
the bank. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There’s some… yeah…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh-huh… well, ‘some’ doesn’t cut it. Your
wife gave us a dollar figure. I want the same exact from you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t – there’s different accounts… the
balance fluctuates…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot like you
ain’t tracking his bottom line, it’d be the first time in history. What
do you think, Earl?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We been fucked with, is what I think. Little
slut lied to us. Put ’em on the spot, they’ll say anything to stay
alive.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, I suppose. Too bad. Guess you’re not
the donut magnate after all. Waste of time. Plug him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ninety thousand.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Say again.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Ninety thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Get out. Don’t try anything stupid.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You’re a tough man to get a hold of,
Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s not me we’re talking about. Question is
what you want.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: See, I’ve got something you might want to buy.
Can’t show you the merchandise right now, but I can describe it for you.
About five- five, hundred and fifteen pounds. I’d say three, maybe four
of that is tits. Black curly hair upstairs and down. Interested?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You sonofabitch –</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Bring him up here.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If ever there was a
two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. One gas station,
a half-dozen stores and a V.F.W. hall. See that building?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’s the bank. Brackett Commerce Bank. You
with me?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Then here’s the drill. You’re gonna walk in
there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of
$90,000 from your account in Boston. Got your wallet?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You ask for the money in cash. Small bills.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Today’s payday at the copper mine, so don’t
take any horsecock about how they haven’t got it. If the manager gives
you a hard time, that’s your problem. It’s your wife who’s counting on
you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How do I know she’s still alive?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: She’s tucked away someplace safe. You get her
back as soon as we get the money. Simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Now a smart guy like you, you’re already
thinking about calling the cops, right?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Iron Man to Blacktop, let’s open the gate.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Copy that, Iron Man.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Like I said, Jeff, if you want to call the
cops, there’s nothing I can do. Hell, with the fire you’ve got in your
eyes right now, I figure you’re fixing on calling the F.B.I., C.I.A. –
even the 82nd Airborne.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Problem is, you can see this town for miles
around. So ask yourself: How’s the law gonna get here? They gonna fly
in? Drive in? Either way, we’ll see ’em. So let me be very clear: if we
see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a
cop – this deal is dead.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Now take a look at the building with the
flagpole.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: There’s exactly two cops in this town. One of
them’s inside pulling ass duty; the other’s on patrol in the foothills.
Now a minute ago one of my men called in a non-injury accident on the
I-40 connector.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’ll take that good ol’ boy 20 minutes to get
to the connector, another 10 to see there’s no accident, and another 20
or so to tool his way back. 50 minutes all in.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’s your deadline. If for any reason one of
those cops pulls into town before I’m looking at a bag of money, your
wife is dead, you’re shit out of luck and we’re gone for good.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: See, that’s why there’s no risk to us in this
thing. You do the legwork. We sit back, we watch, we listen to our
scanners, we monitor you every step of the way. If at any moment we
don’t like something, we split. Period. Helluva lot safer than sticking
up 7-11s, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Put this on. You can’t go into the bank like
that.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: How about it, Jeff? Time to get the show on the
road?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I need to see the manager. I need a wire
transfer from my bank in Boston.</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Yes… sir. I’m the manager. Would you like
to have a seat?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: I said you can have a seat if you want.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Here’s my driver’s license, credit card if you
need it, my account number in Boston… How long is this going to
take?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes, I’m fine. Look, that account only has
$5,000 in it. How much can you advance me on my credit card?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: My credit card. I’ve got a $6,000 limit. Can
you advance me the whole $6,000?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: No, I can’t. For non-customers the limit is
$500 a day. Sir, are you sure you’re all right?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes, I’m fine. Just… transfer the money,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look, I’m going to tell you something.
Whatever happens, just keep filling out that form, okay?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There are people watching –</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Excuse me, you the manager?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>cowboy</strong>: Lady over there said to see you about a car
loan.</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Certainly, sir. Would you like to have a
seat?</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: You were saying, Mr. Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just… transfer the money.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Would you tell the manager I want the money in
these denominations?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: No shit. I can SEE that. How much you got?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The whole thing. Ninety thousand.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Good. Turn left and start walking toward the
main road. Get in the first car that stops.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: When do I see my wife?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: When I say so. Now walk.</p>
<p><strong>calhoun</strong>: Marie, this is Roger Calhoun down at the
bank. Is the Sheriff there? Well, maybe it’s nothing, but you might tell
him we just had a fellow in here acting kind of strange…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Toss the envelope on the seat.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No. First you tell me where she is.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money,
then you find out. Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on
the highway.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Now lift your shirt and jacket and turn
around.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Turn around, hands behind your back, and step
toward the truck.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Now get up in the truck, knees on the floor.
Do it now!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I gave you the money. Now let her go.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: ‘Let her go.’ Do I look like I have her?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What the hell –</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It’s done. I’m heading in. Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet. You
think we picked you out of the blue? New car, Massachusetts plates –
probably be days before anyone misses you. Hell, you shoulda got the
bumper sticker that goes with it: ‘Rich Assholes Looking for
Trouble!’</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’d have loved to see the look on your face
when that car seized up. Help, help, I ain’t got no power!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know what I’m gonna do first with your
money, boy? Well, do you?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’ll give you a hint. Only one thing smells
better than money. You wanta guess what?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: These are… it’s nothing but singles… You lyin’
sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Aaagghh!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where is she, goddammit? What’d you do with
her?</p>
<p><strong>tow truck driver</strong>: Hey! You there!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where is she?!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You like that? How about this?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you sonofabitch!
You want to try ’em again?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How about an emergency stop? You want to try
that, Earl? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fuck you, you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Is that what you want? You really want me to
stop? ’Cause I bet this baby stops on a dime!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: End of the line, Earl! How about it? You gonna
tell me?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: She’s with Billy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah? Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know! Driving around!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Repeat, I am in pursuit of a Dodge Ram
pickup. Request back-up, repeat, request back-up!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Jesus Christ – Dispatch! Suspect
identified as one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat, Jeffrey Taylor!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where were you taking the money?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: To the truck stop…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Main highway… Texaco…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know where she is! My wife!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Drop the gun!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t understand! She’s been
kidnapped!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: I understand plenty. Now get down on
the ground or I’ll shoot!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: You there – in the pickup! You all
right? Can you get out?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah! Just don’t shoot me, officer! He’s
crazy, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Well, get out dammit!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Officer, please. You gotta listen to me –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Shut up. C’mon out, sir. It’s safe
–</p>
<p><strong>sheriff boyd</strong>: Shots fired… Officer down…
Suspect…</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Help is on the way, Sheriff. Just hang
on. I have units and an ambulance en route.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: C’mon, baby, give it up!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t know, dammit, he was supposed to be
here a half hour ago. There’s reports on the police band about a cop
down and this place is crawling with uniforms…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Look, I’m getting out of here. Stay off the
airwaves. Bring the girl and meet me at the barn… You got that?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello? Can you hear me? This is Jeff Taylor. I
need to talk to the deputy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I just witnessed
your sheriff being shot. Now put someone on, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>deputy carver</strong>: It’s no good. He’s not talking. You
better mobilize your boys.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: Daddy, you’re home!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Hey, Deke, you miss me?</p>
<p><strong>arleen</strong>: Deke, get back to bed! I said now! Warren? I
thought you were coming back next week.</p>
<p><strong>arleen</strong>: … but it’s four in the morning. Why can’t Al
and Billy come some other time?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I told you, we’ve got some stuff to take care
of. Won’t be more than a couple of hours – I promise.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Say, Deke, how ’bout opening up the barn for
your daddy?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Deke, c’mon over here, I got something for
you.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Guess which hand.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: This one.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Nope. Try again.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: This hand.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Okay, okay, I’ll give it to you.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: Cool!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Deke? Deke, you back there?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Man, if I never see another couple from
Massachusetts it’ll be too soon.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Tell me about it. You get any word on Earl?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There’s reports of an accident up Five Mile,
but that’s about it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I told you we shoulda gotten rid of ’em like
that couple up in Utah. Nice and clean.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So it got a little fucked up – so what? We stay
out of the area for a while, things will cool off.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Figured I’d get started on the jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Fuck that, you can work on it later. Help us
with the girl.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Must’ve died from the exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I’ll get some plastic. We’ll bury her before it
gets light out.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Aagh!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Goddamn. Scared me half to death.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be more careful
next time.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Shut up. Lemme do her, Red. I’ll cut her head
off right now.</p>
<p><strong>arleen</strong>: Warren? You in there?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Shit, it’s my wife. Help me get her in the
freezer. Just a second, Arleen.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Don’t worry, honey. It’s not as bad as it
sounds. It’ll take you about 10 minutes to suck the air out. Probably
won’t even feel it.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: C’mon, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>al billy</strong>: Howdy, Arleen. Hey, Missus C.</p>
<p><strong>arleen</strong>: Well finally. Are you coming to breakfast?
I’ve been calling you.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sure thing, honey.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy? Amy, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hang on, baby. They’re in the house; I can’t
use the lights. I’m gonna get you out.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s not working. If I make any more noise,
they’ll hear.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m going to get you out of there, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I love you. Please, God, let her still be
alive.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fuck you, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: … So there I am, it’s a howling snow storm,
I’ve got 2000 live chickens that are supposed to be in Denver days ago,
and this cop is busting my balls because I haven’t got chains…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: So what happens but this big old rooster, damn
thing must’ve weighed ten pounds, he reaches out toward that highway
patrolman…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: … just reaches out with his beak, see, and…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Give me the key.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Now hold on, mister. I don’t know who you are
or what you want –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Give me the fucking key!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Mister –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t mister me, you sonofabitch! My wife is
locked in a hole in your fucking barn! You don’t give me the key, I’ll
blow your fucking head off!</p>
<p><strong>arleen</strong>: Warren? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I don’t know, honey. Just stay calm –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Your husband’s a kidnapper and a murderer is
what’s going on! Did you know that about him? Huh? Ever wonder where all
this stuff comes from?</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: Stick ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t want to do that, kid. Just put the
gun down.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Don’t listen to him, Deke. Keep the gun on
him.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Put the gun down.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: My daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time.
He showed me in case I needed to protect Mommy when he’s away.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I understand that, Deke. I’m not gonna hurt
Mommy. But if you pull that trigger, there’s a chance I’ll still kill
your father.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: He’s lying, Deke. He can’t get me. Just pull
the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, Deke, don’t listen to him. He’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Plug him, boy! Do what I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That’s right, boy. Do it. Don’t worry about
me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Deke, no – !</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Oww – goddammit, you little shit!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t fucking move!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Deke? Deke? Get on your feet!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to
your mother. Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay… on your feet. Now, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Let’s go. Out.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Do like he says, Arleen. He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay. Reach into your pocket and hand the key
to your wife.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: This ain’t gonna work, boy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s okay, Arleen. Take it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, now unlock it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Good. Now give me the keys. Deke, push the
door open. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s enough, Deke. Let’s go. Move it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Deke, I need you to open this.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s okay, Deke. There’s a freezer down there
with a woman in it. I need you to let her out.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: I can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The switch is on the right.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: It’s all right, son. Just ignore that
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Deke! You at the freezer?</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay. You’re almost done. Just open it up, let
the woman out.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: She’s all tied up with tape.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You got that Swiss Army knife your dad gave
you?</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Good man. Use that. Make sure you don’t hurt
her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You better pray she’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>deke</strong>: I got her –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff!!??</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy!!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m almost free!!!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy, come up here!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They were going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know, baby. It’s okay. They can’t hurt you
now.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay. Everybody in the cellar.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Remember this moment, pretty boy. ’Cause
whatever happens, no matter how far you run, I will hunt you down and
kill you like a dog.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy, no! It’s not safe –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But there’s a phone inside. We have to call the
police.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: One of them’s still loose. C’mon – this
way!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello? Hello? Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hello? Anyone home?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: C’mon, c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Take it. We may need to get out of here –
Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I’m reporting an emergency… I don’t know the
address, the house belongs to a Red Barr – I mean, Warren something… No,
I don’t know his name!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No – he kidnapped my wife, he’s locked in a
barn… Jeffrey Taylor. If you contact the police in –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Amy?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff, go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Can’t this thing go any faster?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What the fuck?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It’s glass! Use the rifle!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Sonofabitch –</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff… I can’t get out…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s just… I can’t get out…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I mean I can’t get out!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: C’mon, Amy, push!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Push, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You think you can come into my life and fuck
with me? Nobody fucks with me!</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: You think you can fuck with me?!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh God… Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: C’mon, Amy, it’s all you now… you can do
it…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Don’t let me go, Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I won’t, baby… I won’t ever let you go…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How’s the sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Out of surgery. It looks like he’s gonna
make it. As for the wife and kid, she’s not talking, he’s being turned
over to Protective Services.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: We’ve got I.D. on the dead suspects.
Turns out they were all licensed truckers. One of ’em had a rap for
check kiting. Otherwise they could’ve been model citizens.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What about the leader?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: Same thing. His real name’s Warren
Claney. Three speeding tickets in five years – apart from that, he’s
clean as a whistle.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How could they do it? How could they treat it
like a… business?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve been doing this 15
years, I’ve never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: It was simple, efficient and organized.
They stayed on the move, spread it over a dozen states. As long as no
witnesses survived, it’s an untraceable crime. You were just a couple of
the lucky ones.</p>
<p><strong>fbi</strong>: C’mon – let’s get you folks out of here before
things really get hairy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Promise me one thing…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Name it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Next time… we fly.</p>
