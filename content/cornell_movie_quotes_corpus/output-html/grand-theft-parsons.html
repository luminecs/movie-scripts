<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Oh my God please help me! I found
your number in his pocket and I don’t know… I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Ah, what… who are you?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: He’s dead… he’s dead… and I’m… just…
I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Hold on. Tell me who’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met in a
bar and we had a lot to drink and he just…</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Are you sure he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Yeah. He’s really dead. He just…</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Listen. Call an ambulance. Where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn. Room
eight.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Have you got a car?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Call an ambulance. Then get out of
there. Okay? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Yeah, okay. I’m goin’…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You wanna run that by me again, sir?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. I’d like to see Gram Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You want to see Gram Parsons?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes. Alone, if possible. And would you have a
gurney standing by in case I need to move him?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: And you are…. his physician? Or perhaps a
close relative?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Actually, I’m his road manager.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: So you’re not his physician or a close
relative?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mister Parsons is awaiting a post mortem. He
will then be delivered to his family. I suggest you speak to them if you
wish to pick through his personal effects. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now listen here…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: No, you listen here. Mister Parsons is dead
and no longer appears to need a road manager. Which makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sheesh!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello buddy. How you been?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I can’t stand around here chatting with
you all day. Things to do…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Naw, I’m cool thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just taking some stiff down to neurology.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We don’t have a neurology department.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Urology.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. Just hold your horses - I’ll go check
the paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I have the paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No. You have your paperwork. I need to go
check my paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hello? Hello…</p>
<p><strong>ext. desert. morning</strong>: Phil’s trike accelerates as it
approaches a T junction. To the right the sign points to ‘Joshua Tree
Town’, to the left ‘Los Angeles’. The trike doesn’t even slow as it
skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the
road.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Guess who?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Martin Luther King.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Try again…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This…. …isn’t…. …the best time… …Baby….</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: God damn! I’m so sorry, baby.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, out of a job again.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Would never have happened if you were
there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How do you know I wasn’t?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Well, if you were, you wouldn’t have let him
die.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I was still ‘on staff’. He was still my
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So where have you been, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How long this time? Two weeks?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Yeah, let’s have this conversation again.
Like you haven’t just done six weeks on the road…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, but I usually leave a note. And there’s
a paycheck involved.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Come here…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: This is a remembrance.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He was so beautiful, and he understood what my
heart was feeling. I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>gir l</strong>: never laugh again. My inner joy has gone. It
evaporated when Gram departed.</p>
<p><strong>expert</strong>: He sang country music in a way that it had
never been sung before. It was ‘country rock’, if you like. And it was
kinda catchy. At least, the young people seemed to lap it up. It’s fair
to say that when Gram Parsons died, he died a star.</p>
<p><strong>hippie</strong>: It’s like… I can’t… It was real, kinda… I…
Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: And another light burns out in the desert.
Gram Parsons - the standard bearer of the new country music movement -
is dead, following an overdose of drugs. While many of America’s young
people are today in mourning, their parents will view this as another
example of how today’s drug culture can so easily claim a life. We’ll
leave you tonight with the young man’s own words. Gram Parsons wrote a
song called ‘In My Hour of Darkness’, which contains these words: ‘In my
hour of darkness…’</p>
<p><strong>gram’s voice</strong>: In my hour of darkness, in my time of
need, Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed. Oh Lord grant me
vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: When you’re here, I spend my time wondering
when you’re going. And when you’re back, I wonder where you’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Phil, you give me laughs and a great time.
But I’m not sure if that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You mean there’s more than that?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Yes, there’s more than that! There’s
dependable, responsible, reliable…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There’s dull, boring, normal. You should hook
up with someone who works in a bank. I know a guy, actually. He has fish
for dinner every Friday, cleans his shoes twice a week and buys his ties
in bulk because it works out cheaper that way. I’ll put you in
touch.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I don’t mind loving a crazy bastard, Phil.
But you’ve got to be for something and not just against everything. You
have to choose something to represent.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I represent the combined forces of charm,
enchantment and exuberance.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Your job is to arrange other people’s lives.
Maybe it’s time to put a little thought into your own.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Airport, please.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Long time, no see, Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Don’t try and schmooze me, Kaufman, you
repellent slimeball.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The latest victim?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Meet Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s a lot tidier than I remember.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Who the hell is she?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gram’s ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Girlfriend? Isn’t he married?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Welcome to the seventies.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What do you want, Barbara?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m here to fulfill Gram’s wishes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s nice. I have no idea what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Do you know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s Gram’s will.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: To whom it may concern: I would like it to
be known that it is my wish to leave Barbara Mansfield my assets and
belongings in the event of my death. Signed: Ingram Cecil Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did he write that with joined up writing or
was it before he knew how?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Still the jester Kaufman, and still very
unfunny.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s not a will Barbara, and you know
it.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s better than a will, actually. It’s a
signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. And
anyway, it’s really none of your business what this is. I’ve come for
the guitar.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Guitar?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes. Gram’s guitar. He always kept it
here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s been a while since you were around,
Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>phi l</strong>: Gretchen, his wife, took it back six months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t believe you, Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, well done. You found the only unbroken
thing.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Why did you let her in?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s all part of the grieving process.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: How can she behave that way? Gram’s not even
in the ground yet.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Don’t you freak out on me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do me a favor and get the guitar,
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p>****: I gotta make a call.</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: Afternoon. Joshua Tree Obsequies.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Obsequies? What the hell does that mean?
I’m…</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: It’s Latin. It means burial. Is there
anything I can help with? Who am I speaking to?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, you can help me as a matter of fact. I
am…</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: Mister Parsons? I’m sorry, I’ll take a
look immediately.</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: Yeah, he was here.</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: New Orleans. Although he only just went,
so he’ll still be on his way to Los Angeles Airport. Big thrill for us
here, as we’re only a small facility. Nearly got Jane Mansfield in ’67
when she passed through, but she got diverted to Frisco. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>undertaker</strong>: Hello. Hellooo…</p>
<p>****: Phil?</p>
<p><strong>ext. phil’s driveway. day</strong>: Phil is lying down in the
back of Susie’s station wagon, his feet sticking out of the back. Susie
comes out of the house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where
she watches him. After a minute:</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: These things aren’t that big.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Okay. Is that a problem?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Well, that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: So what are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s best you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I don’t know what this madness is, but I’m
not getting involved.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, that’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I mean, I don’t know what it is you’re
planning, but I’m not bailing you out again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: This time, I’m not coming back.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’m going to find a man who buys his ties in
bulk.</p>
<p>****: Hello? Anyone there?</p>
<p>****: There you are. I’m looking for Larry Osterberg.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The door is unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You Larry Osterberg?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes. Welcome to my house.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Very nice. What’s that noise?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Manomanjari on the sitar by Nikhil Banerjee.
Phil stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: There’s no smoking in here, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Who are you, please?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, I’m Phil Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And how may I help you, Phil Kaufman?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’d like to hire your car.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I need to pick someone up at the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Don’t you know anyone with a car?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, of course. It’s just that I’m told your
car is more suitable.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I see. In what way is my car more
suitable?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well… it’s a hearse.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And how is a hearse going to be suitable for
picking someone up from the airport?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s… a joke.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: A joke?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: A prank. A surprise.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, okay. Is it two hundred dollars worth
of surprise?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, it’s more of a fifty dollar surprise.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can lend you a bicycle. Besides, the car is
booked.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Booked how?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I use it to carry equipment for a band.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, here’s two hundred dollars to unbook it.
Let ’em carry their own trombones.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You don’t need to count it. You could trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Let’s see; I’ve never met you in my life, you
shout through my mail slot, you want to hire my hearse as a joke,
and…</p>
<p><strong>lar ry</strong>: you’re twenty dollars short. Why should I
trust you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That last twenty is for gas. Anyway - I
haven’t even seen the car yet. I’m the one who’s operating on trust.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s a hearse. What else do you need to
know?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Meet Bernice.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Bernice?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara
Limousine Funeral Coach. We’ve got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering
three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per
minute. You’re looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred
and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel Rochester
Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission. Bernice weighs
over six thousand pounds.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s yellow.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes, it’s yellow. Bernice comes in
yellow.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s supposed to be black.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: But they’re all black.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That might be my point.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So how is a yellow hearse covered with
flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I paid you two hundred dollars for a black
hearse.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars
for a hearse, and a hearse is what you’ve got. If you take a long, hard
look at Bernice, you’ll see that she’s one of a kind. She’s big, she’s
fast, she’s comfortable, and she’s beautiful. But she’s not black.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. Where are the keys?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh, no. She doesn’t go anywhere without
me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. Well, let’s boogie.</p>
<p><strong>con tinue d:</strong>: Then he turns the keys and pull up and
down to undo the steering lock. Phil watches curiously.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Someone stole her last summer.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I’ve paid top dollar, so it’s nice to
see I’m getting the best…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How did you hear of Bernice and me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You are famous throughout the greater Los
Angeles area.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But you are the only guy with a hearse. Don’t
go getting carried away…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well… What flight are they on?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’ll wait here.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. Well, what time is the flight due?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. How soon?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why do you ask so many damn questions?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shouldn’t we be at arrivals?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Look, will you please shut up asking me
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So how long are we going to wait?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Morning? What do you mean, morning?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’ll make the pick-up in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You wait till morning. I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m only back because I don’t trust you with
Bernice. I don’t even know you, and if you think I’m going to leave my
car with you and just walk away, then you’ve got another thought on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m staying right here. Where I can keep an
eye on things…</p>
<p><strong>con tinue d:</strong>: Then she cuts across the road, and a
delivery van skids to a halt inches away, horn blaring. The driver leans
out of the window, furious.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, lady!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You… should be careful.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Why, thank you…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>check-in clerk</strong>: You’ve just arrived from New
Orleans, mister Parsons?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>check-in clerk</strong>: And you’re flying directly back to
New Orleans? On the same plane?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>check-in clerk</strong>: Okay. Well, enjoy your stay at Los
Angeles Airport, Mister Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ve come to pick up my son’s body.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: My son died out here, you see? So I’ve come
to bring him home.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m wondering if that’s enough information
for you?</p>
<p><strong>check-in clerk</strong>: Yes. Yes. I’m sorry. We’ll… see to
it that you get every assistance on your journey, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Most kind.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’d like to see the manager, please.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Wait your turn.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just that the man I loved
died yesterday. I was forgetting my manners…</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: I’m sorry. Please… go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The manager?</p>
<p><strong>ext. outside mortuary. morning</strong>: Phil walks over to
the door and walks inside the mortuary.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m here to pick up a… coffin.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No. You’re here to pick up a casket.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. A casket.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What flight number?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It was due out on the next flight to New
Orleans, but I’m driving it now. The stiff doesn’t like to fly.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You’re one of those funny guys, right.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, but it’s my day off.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Mine or the…?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The deceased.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Barney - bring up Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>int. bank - manager’s office. morning</strong>: The Bank
Manager is staring at the piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: I simply can’t give you any money
based on this piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s not a piece of paper. It’s a promise
from Gram to leave me all his money.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: Well, I’m sorry, but it’s highly
likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly,
subject to a valid will existing.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: Mister Parsons was a customer of ours.
We can’t just pass his money across to someone who says they’re in the
will. There are… rules.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You don’t seem to understand. These are his
wishes.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: No… I do… understand, Miss Mansfield.
Really I do.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Please tell me how I’m supposed to get my
money.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: Well I imagine that you first need to
prove that mister Parsons is actually dead.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Are you saying that I’m lying?</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: No, absolutely not. But getting a copy
of the death certificate would probably be a good first step.</p>
<p><strong>p. j. gambrell</strong>: Paw on the space, don’tcha
think?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>p. j. gambrell</strong>: P J Gambrell, at yer assistance.
Pernell Jayson. Jes’ saying paw on the space in dese buckets.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Stanley Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>p. j. gambrell</strong>: Gowna be a trip. Besta know yer
otherwise gowna be a slow one.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes. I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Papers?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They’ll be along. With this being a rush job,
they said you’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well, you’d better tell them that we’ve got
rules.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: And this is the exception which proves that
particular rule.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Although you don’t need to tell them
that.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: And this… is your deceased.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Good luck with her.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Is that your hearse?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hearse?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: That hearse.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That hearse?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Are you okay, sir?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay? Sure…</p>
<p><strong>pj gambrell</strong>: Jes sayin’ ’bout the space.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pj gambrell</strong>: Space ma game, kinda. Partitions.
Fixed. Slidin’. Demountable. Integrated.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>pj gambrell</strong>: Always say. Why have one room? When you
can have two?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>pj gambrell</strong>: What’s your bidness?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yup. That’s a she.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: And yours is supposed to be male?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well… Gone.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gone? Whaddya mean, gone?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: We got the wrong box. Your box is being
loaded.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nice work. So how do I get my box back?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re a damn thief.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: That’s very hurtful.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Barney. You receiving?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: So, whatcha doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Doing? Here?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>pj gambrell</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I need to get off the plane.</p>
<p><strong>pj gambrell</strong>: Sheesh. Only jes’ got settled.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Can you speed things up?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What’s the hurry?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’d like to get to the Joshua Tree while it’s
still light.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I thought you were taking him to New
Orleans?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: When you came in, you said you were driving
the casket out to New Orleans. But just now you said you were headed for
the Joshua Tree…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Joshua Tree, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Joshua Tree, Louisiana. Just outside the
city.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Never heard of that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s small. Just another local community
struggling to get by.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>int. phil’s lounge. morning</strong>: Susie is packing. The
phone rings and she hesitates for a moment. Then she continues loading
her case, leaving the phone unanswered.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hello there. We was looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Need you to sign for it again.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Looks like it’s your lucky day after all.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. I’m a real lucky guy.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I don’t like the look of you.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No. Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Wherever there’s a hippie there’s a crime, even
if it hasn’t happened yet. That’s what I always say.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Right. Good saying.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: So whatcha doing here?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We’re meeting someone off a flight.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You’re meeting someone off a flight?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: In a hearse?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes. It’s a… surprise.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Which parts the surprise: The fact that you’re
in a bright yellow hearse, the fact that you’re dressed like something
out of a horror film, or the fact that you’re half a mile from the
terminal and they’re gonna have to walk across two runways to reach
you?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well… the first part.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: The first part.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay, now why don’t you tell me what the hell’s
going on?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Going on?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I don’t care if it is first thing in the
morning - but I sure need a coffee. I tell you, I’ve never seen so many
darned bits of paper to sign! It’s paperwork which is slowing this great
country down. We’re drowning in triplicate!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Good morning officer.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I was just saying how people with work to do -
people like yourself, officer - are just getting engulfed by paper. Grab
the end, will you? Doesn’t that just drive you plain crazy?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I guess it does.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: One casket, six sheets to sign. Six! That
can’t be right. Does that sound right to you?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Nope. Sure don’t.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And the very last thing I want to do is to
hold you up further with my chatter. Thank you for your help, officer.
You have a good day, now.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Just a moment, boys.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yessir?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Your sidekick here has just finished telling me
that you’re gonna pick someone up from the terminal. A surprise, he
said. And here you are loading a coffin into your vehicle…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And there you have it, officer. You see the
gentleman we’re meeting from the plane doesn’t yet know about the sad
passing of his… aunt.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: And you’re gonna meet him off his flight with
her coffin?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: That’s a real nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. We’re doing it this way for the
avoidance of doubt.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Ignition’s a bit temperamental.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Have to use a screwdriver.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I see that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thanks for everything, officer. We’d best be
off…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes! We did it!!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Did what? What did we do?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What was all that babbling about earlier?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I didn’t babble. I just… have a problem with
authority.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t like them and I don’t know what to
say to them. They make me feel uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well of course they make you feel uneasy.
They’re supposed to make you feel uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You hit the wall.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I clipped it. I clipped the wall.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There’s a gap fifty yards wide! You just had
to aim for the gap. How could you miss the gap?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I was distracted. We’re supposed to be
picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and I’d only just woken
up and…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello, officer. I guess they make these
hearses wider than they need to…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Are you on drugs, boy?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Uh, not at this time, no sir.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Not at this time. Okay, well let’s see. You
just missed a gap of fifty yards and hit a wall in broad daylight. Why
was that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Now I’m gonna…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Fantastic. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh, right. So it’s all my fault?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You… you just drove into a wall! Of course
it’s your fault. Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Here it comes…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, what are we doing now?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He said to wait.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nice going, hippie. Went right through the gap
that time.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, we got it. Whoooh!!!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus… What now?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: C’mon, we gotta keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Get out and take your friend with you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Look, I can see you’re a bit… sensitive about
this whole… casket thing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Stop saying that! I can’t get out.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I… look, it’s not right to throw me out onto
the street with a coffin.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m driving back to the mortuary.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Talk.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What talk?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Who’s the stiff?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Parsons?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Long blond hair, blue eyes, mid-
twenties?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well… yes.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Was he in a Berkeley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s a Berkeley?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: A luxury casket of solid mahogany, finished
with a split- hinged lid, eight brass plated casket handles and an
engraved inscription plate.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Parsons. And he’s a… musician?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Was. He was a musician.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: I’m afraid we have no official
notification of death.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: At this current time, the Greater Los
Angeles registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths does not regard the
local newspaper as an official recorder of record.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Can we please talk about this later? This is
not a great place to be right now.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, just a minute. Now I understand… You think
there’s a body back there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You think there’s a body in the coffin!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I can fully understand why you’d think that. I
mean, it is a coffin and all. But would I - would I really - steal a
real live dead body?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You just gave the body away?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well, it’s not like this is a bank. People
round here don’t generally take dead bodies they’re not entitled to.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why did you give it to him?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well, he signed for it.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who signed for it?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: John Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And where do I find this John Nobody?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Empty?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Absolutely, completely, totally.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It looked pretty heavy, for an empty
casket.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They are made of finest… poplar. That’s very
heavy wood.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Poplar? No way? Mahogany, or oak, but
not…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Look, I’m not going to argue with you now.
Poplar is very well suited to the making of coffins.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. So why have we got an empty coffin in
the back of the car?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m… selling them on to a company in Palm
Springs. Lots of stiffs, lots of money. And then of course, it’s very
environmentally sound. And… look, under the circumstances, perhaps we
should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Fifty-fifty? That baby’s worth two grand.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Don’t forget now…</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Notification of death.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So then Bobby transfers ’em into hardboard
boxes just prior to the cremation and I drive the caskets over to a guy
I know in Palm Springs who resells them.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: As new?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well I’m not sure the ‘one careful owner’
thing works with coffins.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The whole thing is completely immoral.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, well. I saw how outraged you were back
there, when I mentioned money. Just think of it as recycling.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look, I really need to get home.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I just… do.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, while I acknowledge the power of your
argument, we have to be somewhere else. So just settle back and enjoy
the ride.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Gas now.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You an undertaker?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sure am.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Ain’t yer surposed to be in black?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nope. We’re special rock ’n roll undertakers.
Musical morticians.</p>
<p>****: C’mon, hippie - let’s roll.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: High test.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: This car runs on regular.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who says it’s for the car?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Ain’t fer the car?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We could go back.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why would we want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I wasn’t expecting a long trip. I haven’t
packed any spare clothes. We could pick up some supplies and drive out
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You want to go home to pick up fresh
clothes?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, yes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And then drive back out tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We could do that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just drive the car, okay?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We could just…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It would…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You might need to repeat that.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Stolen? What the hell do you mean, stolen?
Who steals a body?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I still don’t fully understand what you
do.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I do everything.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Everything?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This little number is for drinking money. By
trade I’m a Road Manager.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh, one of those. Like a well- paid
gopher.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, not like a well-paid gopher. I’m
responsible for movement, maintenance and management. I’m a confidante
and a companion, a partner and a patron, an ally, agent and ambassador.
I’m like an executive nanny. Not a gopher.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: An executive nanny, not a gopher. Thanks for
clearing that up.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So where are the cops?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I called them.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: There’s supposed to be a funeral in New
Orleans. I need to find my boy.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: New Orleans?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The man said he’s going to Joshua Tree,
Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Joshua Tree?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Where’s the son of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: The son of a bitch isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Well, he’s stolen Gram.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Stolen Gram?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: They had some kind of weird pact. I think
Phil’s taken Gram out to the desert.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Some kind of voodoo thing with hot wax and
dolls to stick pins in.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Now that is a wise move, if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I didn’t ask you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You’ll learn about Phil Kaufman. If you
stick around long enough.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: And you know him?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I know he’s a brainless, interfering
asshole, yes.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I don’t need to listen to this garbage.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’s him, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Generally, it’s best to answer the phone to
discover who’s calling.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello baby, it’s the love machine. How are
ya?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Hello Kaufman. I know what you’re up to,
you thieving bastard. I know where you’re going, and I know about your
sick, revolting plans, and I’m coming after you. And when I catch
you…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello Barbara. How nice to hear from you
again. And so soon…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry Barb, gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s been real, though.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Okay, honey. Do you want to see who Phil
Kaufman really is? Do you want to see what he’s capable of?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Or maybe you already know I’m right.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: You don’t know shit about him.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Well why don’t we find out?</p>
<p><strong>int. hearse. day</strong>: Phil gets into the hearse, looks
back at the coffin and sniffs. He looks down at the air conditioning and
turns it up full. Larry starts the engine and the car stalls.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So what’s that about?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sunstroke.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’ve hardly left the car since we met. How
can you have sunstroke?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m susceptible.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re a winner, that’s what you are. A
winner…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Turn off here.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: This isn’t the way to Palm Springs.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It is if you’re a coffin smuggler.</p>
<p><strong>end time lapse.</strong>: As we slow to normal speed, a car
drives past, stops, and reverses back to park by the stall.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ll take that one, please.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Fifty cents.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I was wondering… Have you seen a hearse
pass this way in the last couple of hours?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: What’s it look like?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well… It… It’s a big car. A big yellow car.
Two guys inside.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Was one of ’em sick in them bushes?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well… I don’t know. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Yup. I seen it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: See, the Yin is the negative - the darkside.
And the Yang represents positive - good. If you like, the first is earth
and the second heaven.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The Yin Yang symbol is really evocative about
the whole concept. As you travel around the circle, white or black will
increase until the opposite color is almost gone. But never totally
gone, right? And this cycle then repeats for the opposite color.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What seems like Yin is often supported by
Yang, and vice versa. Let me give you an example: To truly know good,
you must first know evil, and without good as a comparison, nothing can
be evil. So by allowing Yin to flourish, you welcome Yan. By letting go
of Yin, you are waiting for its return. Another example is…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It would be really nice if we could get
through a couple of hours without crashing the car.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I was distracted.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Of course you were.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t believe it. Middle of nowhere, and…
quick - stand in front of the car!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Pretend we’re having a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay. What about?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know what about! Ever since I met you,
you’ve talked. Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute. Religion, your
supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside. Now you need to talk, and
you can’t think of anything to say.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whatever your damn fool religion is called, I
think it works.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well… it’s more a philosophy than a
religion.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, well done. Good work.</p>
<p><strong>con tinue d:</strong>: As he opens his mouth to speak, a
headlight falls off the car and rolls off the road. They all watch it
go.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Afternoon, officer. How’s it going today?</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: Oh, it’s going fine, thank you. How
are things with you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Fine, fine. We just… stopped to take a look
at…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: …the fine view you folks have got around
here.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: Well, it is mighty nice around these
parts. If you like desert.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: And how are things with you today,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Ooooh, I’m well. Really well, actually. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: The reason I ask, is that you appear
to have driven into one of our road signs.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: I’m surprised that you hadn’t
noticed earlier, as it does appear to be impeding your forward
progress.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s a great line…</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: I wonder if you gentlemen can help
me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: I’m looking for some fellows who
stole a body back there at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: A body? Stole a body?</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: A body. Rather like the one in the
back of your car.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s an empty coffin, officer.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: I know it sounds strange. But these
guys - there are two of them - they stole a body, loaded it into the
back of an old yellow hearse painted with flowers, and they’re supposed
to be driving out this way.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hearse. Flowers.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think he’s onto us, Larry. He’s just having
a little fun at our expense.</p>
<p><strong>motorcycle cop</strong>: In the car, please.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: God damn!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He said a body. He said we stole a body.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He meant a coffin.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He didn’t say ‘coffin’. He said ‘body’. Tell
me we haven’t stolen a real person.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Look, the place that I get the coffins from
probably haven’t filed a report yet. It’ll all be sorted out within the
hour. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh, I’m just overflowing with trust for you,
man. I feel this overwhelming feeling of… trust every time I look at
you.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m gonna check inside that box just as soon
as we’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’re going to be arrested, that’s what we’re
going to do. Then we’ll go to court and then we’ll go to jail and we’ll
do that for a while.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What about if I could slip out of these
cuffs?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, that would be great. Then we could
suspend you from a bridge in a straitjacket and set the rope on
fire.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: No, really. I really can slip these
cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay. Show me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Do you think we should go?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, I think we should go.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nicely done.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’ll be moving on, now that your sign no
longer appears to be impeding our forward progress.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The steering lock is on.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well… turn it off!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can’t - he’s got the keys.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So, we’ve escaped but we can only drive in a
circle?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Can we please go?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: If you hate Phil so much, why are you chasing
him across California?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He’s got Gram and I need him.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Well, that’s really touching. But… you’ve got
to come to terms with the fact that he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I know he’s dead, Honey. But he hasn’t been
officially identified, and there’s no certificate of death.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Let’s just say I’m overly sentimental,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: This is all about money, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Isn’t everything?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Why do you think you deserve anything?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I was a great support to Gram before
Kaufman came along and spoiled the party.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Phil’s not responsible for your problems with
Gram.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I know that he can be a pain in the ass, but
when it came to Gram, Phil only ever did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: In his whole life, Phil Kaufman didn’t do
anything because it was the right thing to do. You can bet the ranch
that wherever he is, he’s having some fun.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Maybe that’s what I like about him.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Sure it is, honey. That’s why your bags
were packed.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Have you any idea what it’s like to really
love someone?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You might exclusively love Phil Kaufman -
but unfortunately, so does he. You’re just handy to have around.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I don’t have to listen to this.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Okay, you vindictive bitch. I’m going with
you to Joshua Tree because my life seems to have been turned upside down
and I want to know why. But you don’t know me and I won’t let you judge
me. Do it again and I’ll smash that pretty little face of yours off the
fucking road. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The truth can hurt, can’t it?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, that’s it! They’re going to lock me up
and throw away the key.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why would they do that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You saw what happened. I drove over that
cop’s bike. That’s destruction of police property, or something.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You worry too much.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not ’til I met you…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus - what the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s a dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Very perceptive. What’s it doing?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: ‘The Polyonax Place’. A Polyonax is probably
some kind of dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: ‘Dinoburgers, Reptile Steaks and Primeval
Soup. Titanosaurion portions, prehistoric pricing. Liquor served’.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Pull over - let’s… eat.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Let’s not. The cops’ll be after us and we
should just get on to Palm Springs and do the thing, and then I can get
home and you can… do whatever it is you do. Let’s do that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We need to stop. I’m starting to get hungry.
I’m not nice hungry.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You surprise me. I vote we keep going.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What gave you the impression this was a
democracy?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You frighten him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I do not.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Everyone else, he announces the food when he
brings it. Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that. Us he just slaps it down
and runs for cover.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s probably the rabbit food.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Look, I’m a vegetarian. I have a problem with
dead flesh. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I understand. Really I do. That stuff’ll mess
you right up every time.</p>
<p><strong>int. stanley’s car. day.</strong>: Stanley is driving along
the road. He puts his hand in his pocket, takes out his hip flask, pops
the lid and goes to take a drink. It’s empty. Then he notices the
dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I thought you were hungry.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gotta make a call.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey man, where’s the phone?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Out back.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Do you have a telephone I might use?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: In a minute, I do.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: In a minute?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Yeah. Phone’s for customers.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’d better order, then.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Speak to her?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Your girlfriend? Your wife?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: None of your damn business.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So you didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Maybe she’s out. Shopping, or something.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, that’ll be it. Shopping.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Would you put a scotch in there,
please?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Bad day?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yeaaaaah. Yeah, a real bad day.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: My boy died out here the other day, and
some punks have stolen his body.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: That’s worth a shot on the house.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Haven’t finished my drink.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Why would someone steal a body?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All gone. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well, maybe they were souvenir hunters or
something. My boy’s kinda famous…</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Gram Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Gram Parsons?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Gram Parsons?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons dead?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Better get going.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He said someone took Gram Parson’s body. Two
people…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth. In fact, I
thought he was never gonna stop talking. Anyway, although that’s real
interesting, we’ve gotta keep to the schedule.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Schedule? What schedule? There is no
schedule…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I think we should just make our delivery
as soon as possible, don’t you? Get our package to Palm Springs.
Remember?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Package? We’ve stolen that man’s son.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Stolen… his son? That’s outrageous! I’m
appalled that you could even think we’d do such a thing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t know what you take me for. I want to
see in that box.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’ve really got to go.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s heavy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, then. Well, if you’re satisfied, let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I said it’s heavy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of wood. Wood is
heavy. Actually.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yeah, I remember. Finest poplar.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Jesusjesusjesus…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gosh, they must have given us a full one.
We’ll have to sort that all out when we get to Palm Springs and…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Oh my God. You stole Gram Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, technically, we stole Gram Parsons.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I stole a coffin, I didn’t know there was a
body in it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’d save that line for court.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What are you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t know! What am I doing? I mean…
What-am-I-doing? Why am I here? Why am I with you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I thought it was bad enough when I ran over
the cop’s bike, but now I’m a fucking body snatcher.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, when you’ve quite finished, we should
go.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Go? You go. I tell you what I’m going to do.
I’m going inside and I’m going to give that man his son back. I’m going
to do the right thing, I’m going to follow my conscience, I’m going
to…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: You’re not a very nice person, are you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Nice? No, I suppose not. Does it
matter?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: It might get you further.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I do okay. Listen, I was an orphan at
fourteen and a waitress at fifteen. I do what I do because it puts food
on my table, and because if I don’t look after myself, no-one else
will.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: So what do you want from us?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t want anything from you. It would be
a bonus to see Kaufman crash and burn, but I don’t need to be there when
it happens.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Why do you hate Phil so much?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Gram was the first good guy I ever hooked
up with. He wasn’t perfect, but it worked between us. We just seemed to
fit together. But Gram was already wild, and I made him wilder. Kaufman
watched over him like a hawk, and when he felt things were getting out
of control, he turned Gram against me. I lost the only decent thing in
my life.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Surely Phil was just looking after Gram?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Gram was an adult. He didn’t need a
nursemaid.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Except that now he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yeah. Without my help and while Kaufman was
babysitting.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I don’t like you much, Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’s fine. I just want what’s mine and
then I’m gone. Gone real fast.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Welcome back, hippie.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So why d’ya do it?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Have a guess.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I gave my word. This is what Gram
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What, cruise around the desert until he
starts to smell? Were you - both bombed?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you have friends?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Of course I have friends.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, what would you do for them?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Anything, within reason.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s what I hate about people like you.
Everything’s ‘within reason’. There are always boundaries, provisos. You
only operate with a safety net.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Tell me something - if it was the other way
round, would Gram be sitting here, driving your bones out into the
desert?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’ve missed the point. See, it doesn’t
matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is
the correct way to behave. To me, it only matters what I do. Where you
have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong.
If I make a promise, I keep it - that’s right. If I break that promise -
that’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Ohmygod.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You made me do it, you bastard! I’ve never
hit anyone in my life, but you pushed and you pushed and… you gave me no
choice.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shit. Shitshitshit.</p>
<p><strong>con tinue d:</strong>: He stops by the entrance to the inn
and stares at Stanley’s car parked in the bay outside room 8. He glances
across at Phil, turns the car around and drives in.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Um. I’m one of the guys that took your
son.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’d better come in.</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway/car park - joshua tree inn. night</strong>: A
car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids across the
road. It reverses and pulls in, parking next to the hearse. Barbara and
Susie get out and look around. Then Susie walks over to the hearse’s
passenger window and raps on the glass, and Barbara marches to the back
of the hearse and attempts to open it. She can’t.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Where’s the catch on this piece of
shit?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Phil? Phil!</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: What happened to your head?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: A hippie hit it. I thought you’d gone.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Hold that thought.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I need to know what it is you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I told you what he’s doing! He’s going to
set fire to my Gram in some freaky ceremony with witches and black magic
and… dolls.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Dolls?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Dolls to stick pins in.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I want my man back!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Enough of this shit.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They’ve gotta be in here. It’s fate.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whatever happened to peace, love and
understanding, hippie?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re Kaufman?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’m with him.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Hello Stanley. Remember me? The psychotic
girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hello Barbara. Nothing wrong with your
memory.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Did you sell tickets or something? Now, you
boys want to tell me why you stole my son?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, I didn’t even know he was in the
box.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m going to cremate him, here in the desert
where he felt most at home. That’s what he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The hell you are, Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know I can’t let you do that?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know you have to.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t have to do anything, Mister
Kaufman. This is MY loss! This was MY son! How dare you try to take my
grief away from me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s too late to claim him now.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It means that you were never there when it
mattered to Gram. It means that you stopped being a father the moment he
stopped doing your bidding. It means that you learned to care too late.
That’s what it means.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t have to justify my relationship
with Gram to you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not to me, no.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s true that when Gram left college, we
drifted apart.</p>
<p><strong>sta nley</strong>: He was a disappointment to me, because he
wouldn’t use his brain. He had so much to offer, but he let it trickle
away.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No - he gave it his all, but in a way you
could never understand. And all he ever wanted from you was approval. He
wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I kept everything. Every record, every
article, every photo.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s no good telling me. You should have told
him.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I loved him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Too late…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I understand that you were his right-hand
man, as well as his friend?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I was both, yes.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: And that you weren’t there when he died?
When he needed you most?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So the guilt isn’t all mine, then?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You boys took away my son. I lost him once
in life, and now you’re trying to take him from me again.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Can we just cut through this?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You two stole the body. Theft.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Sweetie, I’m sorry, but you seem to be in
the whole thing up to your neck. Accessory.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: And you are an old fool who should have
called the police, but hasn’t. Stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Now, let’s just call the cops and get it
done. The sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner
his soul will be properly laid to rest.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Hey! What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Son, you had your chance to look after
Gram, and now he’s dead.</p>
<p>****: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I only failed because I couldn’t save him from
himself. You failed him all his life. You never believed. I never
doubted.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Okay. You tell me why I should let you take
my boy.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I was his road manager and his friend. We
loved it out here in the desert, and we made a pact that whoever died
first, the other would come down here and set them free. Gram gave his
word and I gave mine.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re a couple of druggies. Why should I
believe you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t take drugs.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What about you? Are you a druggie?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes. Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nice work. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can’t do this. This isn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Just do whatever feels right to you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: God damn!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you call them?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Are you going to call them?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well, you haven’t given me a reason not
to.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There isn’t a reason. If someone tried to
steal my son’s body, I’d stop them. For sure.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So you are prepared to go to jail?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m expecting to.</p>
<p>****: Don’t you worry - it’s gonna happen!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Mister Parsons?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What is it, son?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’ve been a junkie for over four years. I
started taking heroin on June 5th 1969 at a concert in Indiana. I…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You don’t need…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’ve taken heroin, speed, uppers, downers,
blues, morphine, methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes, acid, valium,
barbiturates, straight LSD, marijuana, marijuana laced with opium,
nembutal, mescalin of course, and medical methaqualone, which made me
shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s very impressive, son.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not my point.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Better make the point.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I started working my way through that list on
June 5th 1969, and since then there hasn’t been a day when I didn’t at
least smoke one joint.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Are we sure that this is helping?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And now I’ve stopped. I stopped because it
seems that I had something more important to do.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He’s doing this because he gave his word. I’m
prepared to do this now because I think it’s right. And because I
believe that each body has a soul. And Gram’s soul doesn’t belong in a
family plot surrounded by strangers. It belongs here, where he was
happiest.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m going to go say goodbye to my son.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: That’s for failing to reinforce my
expectations.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well… I’ll have to do that more often.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you really take all those drugs?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I may have got a little carried away…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: C’mon, time to go…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just checking.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yeah, he took the body and stuffed it in the
trunk of his car before escaping into the night.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Are you coming?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I reckon I am.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Thank God!</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Evenin’ ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Please help me, they’ve got my boyfriend’s
corpse and they’re going to perform a ritual with his body.</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: May I see your driving license please,
ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: My driving license?</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’ve just told you that they’ve stolen a
body and you want to see my driving license?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You people are supposed to be on the
lookout for a hearse. A hearse is a big long car. You can usually tell
which ones are the hearses, because they have coffins in the back. The
one we’re looking for is painted yellow. Does this look like a yellow
hearse to you, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Is that a ticket? Are you writing me a
ticket?</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Yes it is, ma’am. And yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Cap Rock. This is perfect. Really
peaceful…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You wanna give me a hand here?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry, Gram.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now we… do it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Take the top off.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Flesh burns easier than wood.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I can’t believe you just said that. I’m not
taking the top off.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, man. Looking a little peaky…</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Some decorum would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you think that’s enough?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, I don’t know. Maybe a little more.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Enough?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’m not having a conversation with you about
how much gasoline you need to burn a body.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I think that’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Only a little left.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you when it
mattered, but I was there before, and I’ve been there ever since. Gram,
good luck to you, wherever you are.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s my last one, man.</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Jesus! What the hell’s that?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’ll be Gram Parsons, on fire.</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Get in the car, ma’am. Now.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Maybe too much fuel.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nah, I just didn’t factor in the booze inside
of him. Gram always…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think our work here is done.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: How do you know it’s your
boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder.
Look, can I make an observation?</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We’re in the desert. It is dark. If you
want to catch someone in the dark, it’s best not to turn on big flashing
lights and make a loud noise with a siren.</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Do you want to know what I think,
ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No. But I’m really, really keen to find
out.</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: I think it was suicide. He just wanted
to get away from you.</p>
<p><strong>con tinue d:</strong>: Then he glances in the rear view
mirror and sees the man sitting in the casket bay.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Sure is hot.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello, Gram.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you think you should?</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Not gonna hurt me now, is it?</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Nice wheels. Very stylish.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They’re very handy for transporting dead
people around. Nothing better.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: I am dead, then?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re more than dead, Gram. You and the box
are down to bones and brass.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Oh, well. Here’s mud in your eye.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What can I do for you, Gram?</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: You assume I want something.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, you’re here. And seeing as I just burned
you to a cinder, you shouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>phi l</strong>: So I’m guessing you’ve got some kind of
reason.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Well, okay. I just wanted to say thanks.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Doing the thing that we agreed, keeping your
word, keeping them all away…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, that’s okay, Gram. But I don’t need
thanking.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m just taking care of business. That’s what
you paid me for - that’s what I do.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: You shooting for a raise?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Actually, I just quit.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: Well, I s’pose I should be getting along.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Goodbye, Gram. I’m glad it all worked out.</p>
<p><strong>gram</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I said I’m glad it all worked out.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: All what worked out?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Doesn’t matter. Can we go now? I’m getting
sick of sand.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, we did it. We saved a soul.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Singed my damn mustache, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. Let’s roll, hippie.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Where d’you think you might be when I’m
done?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: I’ll be waiting.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, but where?</p>
<p><strong>susie</strong>: Get out of here. Finish it.</p>
<p><strong>fade up on super</strong>: Phil Kaufman and Larry Osterberg
appeared in West L.A. Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 - Gram
Parsons’s 27th birthday. Since a corpse has no intrinsic value, the two
were charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing the coffin and given a
token punishment: $708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for
each of the bodysnatchers.</p>
