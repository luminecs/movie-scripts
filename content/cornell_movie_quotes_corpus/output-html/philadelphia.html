<p><strong>title</strong>: “Philadelphia City Hall.”</p>
<p><strong>city employees, judges, cops, lawyers, criminals,
tourists</strong>: pour into City Hall, into…</p>
<p><strong>jamey runs like hell down a third floor corridor,
footsteps</strong>: making a racket…</p>
<p><strong>joseph miller</strong>: This construction site is causing
mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public!</p>
<p><strong>andrew beckett</strong>: My client has one of the finest and
most respected safety records in the business, Your Honor!</p>
<p><strong>standing before judge eunice tate: andrew beckett</strong>:
and JOSEPH MILLER .</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: One at a time. Mr. Miller?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began
construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been
enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust.
My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other
residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of
outrage!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Your Honor, I submit there were no
complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up
business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only
three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Innocuous?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Defined by Webster’s as harmless.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how
the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding
of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to
mankind’s greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their
lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black,
toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And
Counselor calls it harmless?!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to
portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. But
nothing could be further from the truth. Rockwell has generously
contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood’s schools, clinics
and youth centers! Granting a restraining order on the construction site
will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work, and will lend
validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which
speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is
threatening the very fabric of our society.</p>
<p><strong>judge tate</strong>: Let’s not go off the deep end,
gentlemen. I thought we were talking about some dust.</p>
<p><strong>a man on crutches hobbles into a courthouse elevator and
is</strong>: joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside …</p>
<p><strong>andrew joe</strong>: … plaintiff seeks to re- … whereas
decedent had strain defendants from con- pre-existing asthmatic tinued
improper use of trade condition and ride on name without… Ultra Loop
caused sub-</p>
<p><strong>andrew joe</strong>: … plaintiff’s permission or …
complainant seeks authorization… relief…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Right. Miller.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Client of yours?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Funny.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Excuse me..? Sir? Yo!</p>
<p><strong>the cab pulls up to a brownstone on a residential
street,</strong>: Andrew hopping out, stuffing papers into his
briefcase</p>
<p><strong>classical music … as camera pans patients</strong>: in a
cheerful room… some, like a UPS DELIVERY MAN, are attached to IV’s, some
sit with arms extended, waiting to be hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a
BLACK</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Gonna have to start looking for veins in
your feet, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gillman</strong>: Andy. Can you stop at my office on your
way out?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>andrew hops out of the cab, in front of an
impressive</strong>: skyscraper in downtown Philly, at the end of the
work day</p>
<p><strong>a black paralegal, anthea burton, leads a young, black
law</strong>: CLERK to the elevators, at the sedate, expensively
appointed offices of Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown …</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: … up to Tax, on fourteen, and get right
back, I need you.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Just the dazzling paralegal I wanted to
see.</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: I know what that means, and the answer is
no. I have a class tonight. Exploit someone else. And since you’ve asked
…</p>
<p><strong>killcoyne</strong>: Solid work on the Rockwell situation,
Andy. Top-notch.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks, Kenneth. Your exam!</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Thank you. 98. I gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Ninety-eight?! Ninety-eight!</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Conference call’s up. They just started the
roll call. Here’s the settlement agreement, the red-lined copy’s on your
desk. Need me in there?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No. Great. Thanks, Shelby. It’s 6:30, go
home.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Rach.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m late, I have to pick up Amy from her
afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Catch me later, I’ll be here. And tell Amy,
I love her painting, it’s on my wall.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: … Karen Hargreave, representing Lloyd
Management Corporation?</p>
<p><strong>hargreave</strong>: Present.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Andrew Beckett, representing Saunders
International?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Present.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Hi, Mom. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you,
hon?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What’s Dr. Gillman say?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Hold on, Mom. There’s no way my client will
go along with that.</p>
<p><strong>hargreave</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I’m sorry I
interrupted…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Gillman says I’m fine. My blood work is
excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec … Yes, I think that would
alleviate most of our concerns. My platelets look good too.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you on one of those conference calls? I
hate when you put me on hold.</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “One-thirty a.m.”</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Ah hah! Yes! Rentworth v. Pennsylvania…
court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages for wrongful
interference with prospective economic relations…</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON
says:</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Look at this fucking guy. He’s an
animal.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Are we interrupting, Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: In a word, Bob…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Charles is right behind me.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I was just about to take a break. Good
evening, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Andy? Could you step into my office for a
sec? I feel like firing someone tonight.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: We’re gonna miss you around here, Bob…</p>
<p><strong>the reception area : a domino’s pizza delivery</strong>: MAN,
waiting for clearance from a SECURITY GUARD, on Andrew’s dim and quiet
floor, WATCHES AS…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Andy’s expressed a keen interest in the
Kronos Inc. situation, Charles. Is that correct, Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: The fate of the participants interests me,
yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: It’s good to be King, hey Charles?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Kings are out of fashion. I’d rather be
thought of as a benevolent tyrant. It’s an anti-trust action.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: It is, and it isn’t, Charles. Macrosystem’s
new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos’ spreadsheet
program. If they’re allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right
out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright
infringement.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the
chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine… which
side of this mess would you desire to be on, Andy? And don’t allow my
very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in
any way.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Sorry, Charles, but…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’d like to see Kronos win.</p>
<p><strong>across andrew’s face, revealing</strong>: a faint purple
blotch about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw on the
HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrew’s doctor’s office.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Why, Beckett?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Because they deserve to, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young
company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work.
Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent
exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Bailey, Brackman.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Get with the program, Andy. As of this
evening, about 8:05 this evening, right after the soup course… Kronos
Incorporated is represented by Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown.
Or, more specifically, senior associate Andrew Beckett.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: You’ll have to get right on it, Andy, we’re
up against the statute of limitations.</p>
<p><strong>associate lawyer</strong>: Tokyo on four, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Great. Excuse me, fellas. Connichiwa.
Itsumo osewa ni nari mashita. Arigato gozaimasu.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: What’s that on your forehead, pal?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Whacked with a racquetball. I appreciate
your faith in my abilities.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Faith, Andy, is the belief in something for
which we have no evidence. It doesn’t apply to this situation. Go home.
I mean, get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: No sweat, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>andrew stepping into the empty corridor, taking a few
steps</strong>: away from Wheeler’s office , then…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: It’s good to be King.</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “Ten days later.”</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: You want to apply the foundation as evenly
as you can, Andy. You don’t want to look like you’ve thrown it on with a
spoon.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: Okay. You try.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Chandra? Don’t you think this color’s a
little… orange for me?</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: Tahitian Bronze works best on lesions.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Think of it as the “I just back from Aruba”
look.</p>
<p><strong>in the background</strong>: Andrew’s fax machine receives a
fax in .</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks, Bruno. I’ve been out of the office
four days. I don’t want them to think I’ve been to the beach. Okay.
Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Hides everything, right? What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: You know who you look like, Andy? That
actor, in that movie. Not the one where he was autistic, the one where
he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera…</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Dustin Hoffman.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Tootsie!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: You want to try Light Egyptian?</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Excuse me a sec…</p>
<p><strong>chandra</strong>: Just like my cousin Fredo.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You okay, Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I think I need to go to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>miguel alvarez runs urgently down spruce street,
dodging</strong>: traffic as he crosses Eleventh Street, toward
Jefferson Hospital . He hustles up the ramp toward the Emergency
Entrance…</p>
<p><strong>miguel shoves through glass doors, into the
bustling</strong>: Emergency Room , FINDING</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Yeah. Thanks, guys.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Gillman’s out of her office today. I told
her to take a day off, and she did, can you believe it? Did you get
someone to cover your class?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Don’t worry about it. They took blood? A
specimen?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Aren’t you giving an exam?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: I said, don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: You got a fever, baby.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I almost didn’t make it to the bathroom,
Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: So what? It’s nothing to be ashamed of. You
have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Wait, here’s my guy… Hey!</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Mr. Beckett, I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: About my blood work?</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: We’re waiting…</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: … meanwhile, I’d like to prepare you for a
colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Sounds delightful.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Why do you need to do this?</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Who are you? Doctor… ?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: This is my partner. We keep records of
hospital visits. Nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Dr. Klenstein. It’s not a pleasant
procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right
away.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: It could be parasites, an infection…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: A reaction to AZT…</p>
<p><strong>klenstein</strong>: That’s possible, but.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: He’s not going through some painful
procedure until we’ve cancelled out everything else.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: I’m trying to help your “partner.” You’re
not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the
ER.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: He’s upset, he’s sorry.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Don’t apologize for me.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: He’s not sorry, okay, fine. Why don’t we see
what we find out from the blood work? I’ll work on getting a specimen,
I’m sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then,
we’ll hear from my doctor, and we’ll go from there. Okay? Everybody
happy?</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Allright. I’ll get on the lab about the
blood work.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: That’s the third time. I better call the
office. Would you relax, please?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: I am relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>joe miller’s voice</strong>: “If you or someone you
know…”</p>
<p><strong>andrew’s pov on television</strong>: Joe Miller on the
screen, with the words “Negligence… Malpractice… Auto accidents”… and in
the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “… has been injured through the fault of
others, you may be entitled to legal remedy…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Shelby? It’s me. Jamey’s been beeping me, I…
Okay, okay, calm down. Put Jamey on.</p>
<p><strong>first year associate jamey collins, sitting at andrew’s
desk</strong>: , GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew’s intercom BUZZES…</p>
<p><strong>jamey</strong>: Andy?! This is a disaster! We can’t find your
revisions on the Kronos complaint!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Slow down, Jamey, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>jamey</strong>: I went down to Word Processing to pick up the
corrected copy, but they said you haven’t delivered the corrections. I
told them you’ve been working on it at home, and…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I brought it in last night, around midnight.
It’s in my computer.</p>
<p><strong>jamey</strong>: What did you file it under?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: K-R-O-one.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Jamey, I don’t have to mention, do I, that
we’re up against a statute of limitations on this complaint which runs
out in… Seventy-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jamey</strong>: It’s not here, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You go down to Word Processing and tell
those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint, now! Or
they are fucking dead! You tell them that comes from me!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Every problem has a solution. Every problem…
has… a… solution.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Every problem has a solution…</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Why are you getting dressed?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You’re not going to like this. Please try to
smile…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks for leaving school, and coming here,
and… I will be back. An hour, tops.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: You’re going to the office?!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You’re not smiling.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: You’re leaving the hospital? You’re going
into the office looking like that? Are you insane?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: One hour!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Drew!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I promise!</p>
<p><strong>andrew steps out of the taxi in front of the
wheeler</strong>: Building, heading for the entrance …</p>
<p><strong>from a high floor, andrew can be seen climbing the steps
of</strong>: an emergency stairwell …</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Didn’t expect to see you… ?</p>

searching</strong>: through papers …</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: I’m looking through the files but…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Call the messenger service, have someone
standing by… Your phone.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Think. You brought the discs in, you
transferred…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I thought I was supposed to be covering for
you. God, Andy, you look awful.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos
complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o’clock! If it’s late,
there’s no case… Every problem has a solution.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey
look.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Bob? Something’s come up. With Kronos. I
don’t want to upset Charles, but… Oh, shit, Bob, the complaint’s due in
forty minutes and I can’t find it. No, you don’t have to come… Great.
Fucking great.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: C’mon, Andy, you didn’t lose anything…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I don’t know what to do, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: You’ll never find it in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: What in God’s name… ?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Bob…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: What’s wrong with your face?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What’s wrong with my face? You want to know
what’s wrong with my face? I’ve got a skin condition. Next question,
Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the
complaint?</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Allright. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: What was the file name?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: K-R-O-one.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Maybe you mistyped the name when you were
saving it. We’ll try combinations of those letters…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You’re right, I probably just misfiled…</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Andy?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Some sort of problem?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of major
problem.</p>

side? Don’t move the baby!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Give me the camera, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thanks, hon. Oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh my god… oh my god, look at her… oh my

<p><strong>joe, walking the hospital corridor, still wearing

<p><strong>joe</strong>: Go to Famous Fourth Street and buy a pound of
Nova. No! She likes Scotch salmon better. Ah heck, get a pound of both!
Get a dozen onion rolls. Get some bagels. Get a dozen. Get a bottle of
champagne. Dom Peringon… A hundred bucks a bottle?! Better get a good
California…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Give me a call. Get everything over here as
soon as you can, she’s starved. No, not the baby! Lisa! … Iris, listen:
any calls I should know about? … Uh huh… Uh huh… Beckett? Who’s Andrew
Beckett?</p>
<p><strong>joe’s mother/aunts/uncles, etc.</strong>: Congratulations!
How is Lisa?! When can we see the baby?!</p>

<p><strong>joe</strong>: How big was this hole you fell into?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And this hole was right in the middle of the
street?</p>
<p><strong>joe is in his office, a box of cigars on the desk with
pink</strong>: bands announcing “It’s a girl!” . On the walls are photos
of INJURED CLIENTS …</p>
<p><strong>mrs. finley</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why didn’t you cross at the crosswalk?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. finley</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>andrew is seen from behind, sitting on a sofa in the

ballcap…</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Mr. Beckett?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>andrew steps into joe’s office . andrew glances</strong>: at
the photos while Joe wraps up…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Explain this to me like I’m a six year old,
okay? The entire street is clear except for one small area under
construction, with a huge hole that is clearly marked and blocked off,
and you decide you must cross the street at this spot. You fall into the
hole and you want to sue the city for negligence? …</p>
<p><strong>mrs. finley</strong>: Yeah. Do I have a case?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to
go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She’ll tell you
about our fee arrangement. Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the
accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. finley</strong>: Now that you mention it…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Tell Iris all about it. Take good care of
Mrs. Finley, Iris. Beckett, come in.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Jesus Christ, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I have AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Whoa-oh! Sorry, I…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: It’s okay. Can I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: New baby?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: One week old.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Little baby girl.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Kids are great.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thanks, Beckett. I’m real excited about it.
What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to
bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his
partners.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow
and Brown?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Correct. I’m seeking representation.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I misplaced an important complaint. That’s
their story. Want to hear mine?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How many lawyers did you go to, before you
called me?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago.
During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in
ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against
telling anyone about it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: My lover and I.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your… lover?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Miguel Alvarez. We’ve lived together for
nine years.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I dove back into work, everything was fine.
Until the lesions started…</p>
<p><strong>tight on andrew wauking through the lobby of the
wheeler</strong>: Building . He’s wearing MAKEUP, which sort of covers
the blotches. …</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: First on my leg. Then my forearm, my back.
Then… my face. For a short period, I avoided the office during the day,
waiting for the chemo therapy to clear up the lesions…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: But I never let anything slide. I made all
my calls from home. I worked sixteen hour days on a complaint for a 350
million dollar copyright infringement suit.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: But the day the complaint was due, it
disappeared. Erased from my computer. I thought I was losing it,
mentally…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: That can happen, it’s called AIDS dementia
when it gets into your brain. But miraculously, a copy of the complaint
was located at the last minute, and we got it to court on time…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: The next morning, I was called to the office
for a meeting with the managing partners. Walking down that corridor was
strange. Felt like everyone was staring.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hell, they are staring. What’s that shit on
your face?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Makeup.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: The partners were waiting for me in the main
conference room.</p>
<p><strong>camera tracks into the conference room, giving us
andrew’s</strong>: POV as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton,
Killcoyne, Bob Seidman are waiting …</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Sit down, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Thanks for coming in.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Andy. Before we begin, I’d just like to
say: everyone in this room is your friend.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’re in trouble.</p>
<p>****: Joe IS SEEN IN HIS OFFICE, or LEANING AGAINST A</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I know that, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: More than your friend. Family.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Big trouble.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Charles, I must apologize again, for the
Kronos mishap. It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank
God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: This time. What about next time?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: There won’t be a next time, I guarantee
it.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Andy. It seems that something has come over
you, lately: A kind of… stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus… Earth to
Andy. Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Helloooo…</p>
<p><strong>killcoyne</strong>: That’s right, Andy. The last four, five
months you’ve seemed really out of it…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: At least… different, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Perhaps… you’re right. I’ve certainly been
busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and
the Saunders trial all falling at the same time…</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Some people think you have an attitude
problem, Beckett.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Really? Who thinks that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I had no idea there was a concern in that
area. Hey: I’ll get to work on it right away.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: We’ve been talking it over, Andy. Your
future that is… We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to
be honest with you.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Honesty is always best.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Do you really think so, Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes, Bob, I do. Excuse me? Am I being
fired?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Let’s put it this way, Andy: your place in
the future of this firm is no longer secure.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: In a word, yes.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: We don’t think it’s fair to keep you here,
where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck
in the world.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: And I hate to rush you out of here,
but…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But he’s got lots of other people’s lives to
ruin…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: … we’ve got a committee meeting.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect…
this is… preposterous! It doesn’t make any sense, it sounds as if we’re
talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I’ve had
the distinct impression I was kind of… one of the rising stars around
here. And I feel that wasn’t just my imagination. And I also think I
deserve to know what’s really going on here, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Oh, you’re right, Beckett, you don’t have an
attitude problem.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Take it easy, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: If you’d lost confidence in me, why did you
give me the Kronos suit?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: I hoped the challenge would improve your
performance. You could say it was a carrot.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: A carrot?!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I buy that.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: As in, the vegetable?</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Andy, you nearly blew the case, for God’s
sake! That alone is inexcusable. It would have been catastrophic for us.
Put yourself in our shoes, Andy. There’s no coming back from an error
like that, regardless of who you are! I’m sorry, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Uh huh… Okay… I see…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Good luck, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: I’m here to escort you to your
office so you can organize your belongings.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Okay. Explain to me like I’m a two year old,
because there’s an element to this I can’t get through my thick head:
Didn’t you have an obligation to inform your employer you had this
dreaded, deadly, infectious disease?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: The law says people with disabilities cannot
be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their
position…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Okay, okay… They discover you have this
horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number
of perfectly valid reasons. They’re frightened for themselves, their
families… Maybe it’s the homo angle. Maybe they don’t want to rub elbows
with someone who’s just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of
acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for
Chrissake?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they
fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute
excellence. And if they hadn’t fired me, that’s what I’d be doing
today.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Okay… They want you out. It’s against the law
to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which
leads us to the mysterious, lost file.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: They sabotaged me.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I knew you were going to say that. I don’t buy
it, and I don’t see a case.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Look. I know I have a case. If you don’t
want to take it for personal reasons…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Correct. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks for your time.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beckett? I’m sorry about… what’s happened to
you. It’s a fucking kick in the head.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Don’t send flowers, Joe. I’m not dead
yet.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Find out if Armbruster can see me this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>filko</strong>: What the hell’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>the street: andrew emerges from the lawyer’s
building</strong>: . CLOSE ON ANDREW, standing there as an endless flow
of people passes by. He watches them go, thinking…</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: You had contact with someone who has
AIDS, and you’re worried.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m not worried. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: Checking your blood pressure,
relax.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I didn’t have contact. What do you consider
“contact?” We were sitting in the same room, three, four feet… What if
you shake hands? Wait. I know the answer. Only sex, or sharing needles.
I know that. We didn’t shake hands, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: The HIV virus can only be
transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and
semen.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: Leave that.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, but Doc, isn’t it true they keep finding
out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there’s no
danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I
hear on the news: “whoops! We were wrong.’ You can carry it on your
clothes, your skin, and now I’ve got to worry about my kid. What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: We’re going to draw blood.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why are we going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: Joe. I don’t care a whit about your
private life.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You want to give me an AIDS test?!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The guy sat in my office! You can’t get AIDS
that way, right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It doesn’t travel through the air, by
breathing, or touching, right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: Not by touching, or shaking hands,
or hugging, using the same toilet… Even kissing someone with AIDS is
safe. But it there’s something in your past you’re worried about…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thanks, Doc, but I don’t need an AIDS test. Are
you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: In my past?</p>
<p><strong>armbruster</strong>: IV drug use.</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: A homosexual encounter.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Get real.</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: Unprotected sex with a
prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Uh…. No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>dr. armbruster</strong>: Or unprotected sex with someone you
didn’t know very well, any time during the last twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You have a problem with gays, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Not especially.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How many gays do you know?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How many do you know?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Lots.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who
lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he’s one
of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who’s putting in our
kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful,
sensuous woman is a… lesbian?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Duh…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Probably since she was born.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Allright. I admit it: I’m prejudiced. I don’t
want to work with a homosexual. You got me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Okay, Joe…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I
don’t get it. Don’t they get confused? “Is that mine? I thought it was
yours.” Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative… I think maybe
you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea
really is.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Fine, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And the way they work out, pumping up, so they
can be macho and faggot at the same time… I can’t stand that shit. Now
I’m being totally honest with you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: That’s perfectly clear.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Would you take a client if you were constantly
thinking: “I hope this guy doesn’t touch me. I don’t even want him to
breathe on me?”</p>
<p><strong>the streets of philly are dusted with snow, store
windows</strong>: decorated for Christmas. Joe steps out of the Famous
4th St. Deli, with a package …</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “Two weeks later.”</p>
<p><strong>joe sits at a table in the public law library, surrounded
by</strong>: books and legal pads, hard at work. He’s eating a pastrami
sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN
saunters by …</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: This is the supplement. You’re right,
there is a section on… … HIV related discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: We have a private research room
available.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m fine, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Wouldn’t you be more comfortable in a
research room?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No. But would it make you more
comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Whatever, sir.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh, Beckett. How’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Who’d you get?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Find a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m a lawyer. How’s your baby?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Huh? Oh. Great. She’s great.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Rayisha.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Rayisha. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How did they find out?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: One of the partners spotted a lesion on my
forehead.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How do you get from one lawyer spotting a
lesion, which could have been a bruise, to the partners deducing you had
AIDS and basing a decision to terminate you on that conclusion?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter
Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There’s a paralegal
there, Maria Torres. She’s had lesions on and off for three years. She
says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were
caused by AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: They didn’t fire her?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No. They didn’t fire her.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So Kenton connected the… lesion, and whatever
suspicions he had about your personal life… to this woman, Maria… and
blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you’re losing files, and it’s time to
let you go. But, up to this point, you’ve been their Golden Boy, their
rising star… Their behavior is… inconsistent.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: There is no relevant precedent.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Arline decision. Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Arline?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “The Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of
1973 prohibits discrimination…”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “… against otherwise qualified handicapped
persons who are able to perform the duties required by their
employment…”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “Although the ruling did not address the
specific issue of HIV and AIDS discrimination…”</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to same angle an hour later</strong>: Andrew and Joe
face each other at their table, but NO ONE ELSE remains at that table,
or at the table next to it…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: “Subsequent decisions have held that AIDS is
protected as a handicap under law, not only because of the physical
limitations it imposes…”</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to a same angle an hour later</strong>: : Joe

but for Andrew and Joe.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: “But because the prejudice surrounding AIDS
exacts a social death which precedes the actual, physical one…”</p>

the same side of the table, reading the same book.</p>

<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: … interview every employee, support staff,
associates, partners. Did any of them know Andy was sick? How did they
know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his
appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We
know that. Make sure everyone else does too… And Beckett: I want to know
everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars
on Camac Street?</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: What about other homosexual facilities,
whatever they are?</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Charles…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: What deviant groups or organizations did he
secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Let’s settle with Andy and put this whole
tragic mess behind us.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into
our men’s room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: We ought to be suing him.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: For Christ’s sake, where’s your
compassion?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Compassion? Andy sucks cocks, Bob. He takes
it up the ass. He’s a pervert.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: That’s kind of… extreme, Walt. Andy’s
private life is none of our business.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Bob. You’re trying my patience. Andrew
Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did
he say, “I’m sick. I might not be able to see this through?”</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: He was doing a great job.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up.
Did Andrew Beckett say “I might not be able to serve our clients to the
best of my ability?” He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view
of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.</p>
<p><strong>killcoyne</strong>: Beckett doesn’t want to go to court, he’s
hoping for a quick tasty settlement.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: A jury might decide that Andy has a
case.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Wait a minute. The man was fired for
incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn’t know he was sick, did
you, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>filko</strong>: Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler?!</p>

<p><strong>colleague</strong>: Hey, it’s the local chapter of the
ACLU!</p>
<p><strong>filko</strong>: You’re a Republican, Joe! You belong to the
NRA!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How many toilet stalls are there in the women’s
restroom on this floor, Filko?</p>
<p><strong>filko</strong>: How many… what?!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Two. How many toilet stalls are there in the
men’s room? Two, plus four urinals. How many wheelchair accessible
toilets in either of those restrooms? Zero. In this entire building?
Zero. Get the picture, Filko? Discrimination! You find yourself a
female, paraplegic, legal assistant who is qualified to work here,
except she can’t take a leak… and you’ve got yourself a sex
discrimination suit and a handicapped discrimination suit. Not
handicapped. What do you call someone who can’t use a normal restroom?
“Gastro-intestinally challenged!”</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Wyant Wheeler’s asking for a postponement on
the prelim, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Low-life, sleazy scumbags. Of course they want
a postponement, I’ve got a client with a terminal disease. They’re going
to drag their heels every step of the way, the rotten bastards.</p>

boyfriend’s going to die?”</p>

Drew’s not going to die of AIDS. There’s a cure around the corner, and

<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Yes. I think it will be a simple solution.

<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: You’re looking better, Andy. How do you
feel?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Fine, thanks, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Charles, Walter…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Congratulations on the new grandson.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Thank you. We’re very happy.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Attorney for the plaintiff?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts
Legal Services.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: I’ve seen your television
commercials. “If you or anyone you know has been injured through the
fault of others… It should say,”through the negligence of others.”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’ll take that under consideration, Your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: On behalf of the defendants?</p>
<p><strong>belinda conine</strong>: Belinda Conine. Of Petersen, Lehigh,
Monroe and Smith.</p>
<p><strong>jerome green</strong>: And Jerome Green.</p>
<p><strong>dexter smith</strong>: Dexter Smith.</p>
<p><strong>ralph petersen</strong>: Ralph Petersen.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: You’re outnumbered four to one. Whom
do I address? I can’t talk to four lawyers at once.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I’m chief litigator, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Fine. I’ve asked the litigants to be
present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter
today, among ourselves… There is nothing I hate more, than to see
lawyers suing each other. If you look at the opinion polls, when
Mr. John Q. Citizen is asked to rank professions according to the
respect he holds for them… Where are the lawyers? Somewhere below
personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers.
If we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest
difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap
like bucks in heat, we’ll fall lower on that list. And when people lose
respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. And when this
society loses all respect for the law, we’ll be murdered in our beds, my
friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our
children and our grandchildren will live like savages.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: If it please Your Honor, we hope to settle this
matter.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: By God you will settle it! If you
force this case to trial, young man, you’ll regret it for the rest of
your natural-born days… Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle
this matter today?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering
the period of unemployment and…</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Hold it, Joe. He wants to come back
to work, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: That’s impossible, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: That’s impossible, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>belinda conine</strong>: If it please Your Honor, we’re
prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty-five thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your generosity overwhelms me, Belinda,
considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was
terminated almost six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Give me a break, Joe. Let’s cut
through these false attitudes. Give them a figure. How much do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I want to go back to work, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: You’re here at my indulgence, young
man. I’m waiting for a figure, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Based on what my client would have earned over
the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the
extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome… We would settle today for the very fair amount of
one million five hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I’ve
got a figure over here, of one million, five. I…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: One more thing, Your Honor…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Any settlement agreement must include, and
this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination
had nothing to do with the quality of my work.</p>
<p><strong>belinda conine</strong>: Your Honor, Mr. Beckett’s
incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million dollar suit.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I was the one who was sabotaged.</p>
<p><strong>belinda conine</strong>: We have complaints about
Mr. Beckett’s lack of preparation, his disorganization, his arrogant,
defensive attitude… The list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>jerome green</strong>: We have letters.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why haven’t you produced these letters?</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Take it easy. What’s the big deal,
Chuck? The boy wants a letter, to show to his mother, for her to keep
after he’s gone. Why are you being hard- assed about this?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: I wish I could exonerate you, Andy. But I’d
have to lie to do it.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You can save it for the jury, Charles. I
want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I’m a
bad lawyer. Gentlemen. Counselor.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Don’t do this, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Whoa, whoa… What do you expect them to say,
you’re Alan Dershowitz?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: A trial takes time, Beckett. Do you know
what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I think I catch your subtle drift,
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: You’ll be sorry, Beckett.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Andy, you don’t want this.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: With all due respect, Your Honor, my client
chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial.</p>

<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth
anniversary?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that
thing down and give me a hug. Andrew, stop! … He still doesn’t
listen.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Where’s Dad?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s out in his shed showing your uncle his
new riding mower.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Things might be said, at the trial, that…
are not going to be easy for you to hear. Things about me, about my
private life. And I want to make sure it’s okay with everybody.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I appreciate you asking, Andy, but really,
it’s your call.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What do you think, Jill?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: To be honest, I’m worried about Mommy and
Daddy. They’ve had to go through so much already… And, we all know…
There’s going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually. I wonder
if it’s fair to put them through this.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: All I know is, you got through your diagnosis
fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you… you were so devastated,
Andy… I don’t expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight
for your rights.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks, Mom… Dad?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Supposedly, the Lord doesn’t give you more
trouble than you can handle. But I’m having a hard time believing that
these days.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Andy, the way you’ve faced this whole thing,
you and Miguel, with so much courage… your mother and I have been so
very impressed…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I can’t imagine there is anything, that anyone
could say, that would make us feel less proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How about you,
Randy?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Hey. You’re my kid brother, Andy. That’s the
bottom line. I mean, what are those bastards going to say? You’re gay?
Shit, I knew that when you were five years old.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Wait a minute… You’re gay?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What about you, Andy? You’re not a militant
type. You’ve always been so private.</p>

more.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jim? Will you lead us in a prayer?</p>
<p><strong>reverend jim</strong>: Dear Lord. Sometimes it is difficult
to remember to be grateful…</p>
<p><strong>reverend jim</strong>: To remember, in our times of sorrow
and confusion, that we have You to turn to, and each other. Bless and
keep Andrew and Miguel, dear Lord, deepen and strengthen their love as
they face the struggles that lay ahead. Bless and watch over all of us,
fill us with Your love, Your light, and Your peace, which passeth all

<p><strong>title</strong>: “Eight months later.”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: There won’t be any last minute, surprise
witnesses…</p>
<p><strong>a man looking into camera: he’s young, confident,
all</strong>: American, a Marine …</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “Opening statements.”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No one will break down on the stand with a
tearful confession…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You are presented with a simple fact: Andrew
Beckett was fired. You will hear two explanations for why he was fired.
Ours. And theirs…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s up to you, to sift through layer and layer
of truth, and determine for yourselves the version that sounds the most
true.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: There are certain points in our version, that I
must prove to you… Point number one: Andrew Beckett was… is a brilliant
lawyer. A great lawyer. Point number two. Andrew Beckett, afflicted with
a debilitating disease, made the legal, understandable, personal choice
to keep the fact of his illness to himself… Point number three: His
employers discovered his illness. And ladies and gentlemen, the illness
I’m referring to, is</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Point number four. They panicked. And, in their
panic, they did what most of us would like to do with AIDS… Get it, and
the people who have it, as far away from us as possible.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The behavior of Andrew Beckett’s employers may
seem reasonable to you. It does to me. After all, AIDS is a deadly,
incurable, disease…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But however you come to judge the behavior of
Charles Wheeler and his partners in moral, ethical, human terms… When
they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, they broke the law.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And, when lawyers break the law, when this
society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished
institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and
grandchildren will live like savages.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a
consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a
multi-million dollar lawsuit… Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies
and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great
efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his
duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did not know Andrew Beckett had
AIDS when they fired him…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Fact. AIDS is a tragedy…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Fact. Andrew Beckett is dying.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Fact. Andrew Beckett is angry. Because his
“lifestyle,” his reckless behavior, has cut short his life… And in his
anger, his rage, he’s lashing out. And he wants someone to pay.</p>
<p><strong>on the witness stand: a solidly built executive from
a</strong>: large insurance company, MR. LAIRD …</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Andrew Beckett represented your company in a
lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: Wyant Wheeler represented us.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation
for the suit.</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Were you pleased with his work?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: We were satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Were you satisfied, or were you pleased?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: We were satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a
witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a
deposition. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: According to the deposition, you said you were
“thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed” by the quality of Andrew Beckett’s
work. Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: I may have said something like that. But
that’s not how I feel at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I’m a
four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: We won.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: It satisfied me.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s a long way between being overwhelmed and
being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and
champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be
considered overwhelming. Do you agree?</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: I might.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Five months ago you characterized Andrew
Beckett as caviar and now you’re calling him a cheeseburger. Your
standards have shifted a great deal, and I’d like to know why you’ve
changed your mind.</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: Since that time I’ve devoted more thought to
the subject, and that’s how I feel now.</p>
<p><strong>jerome green</strong>: Partner Robert Seidman was the
supervising attorney for your lawsuit?</p>
<p><strong>mr. laird</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jerome green</strong>: Does the supervising attorney guide
the litigating attorney during the trial?</p>
<p><strong>mr. laird</strong>: Often, he does.</p>
<p><strong>jerome green</strong>: As far as you know, in the handling of
your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was simply following orders.</p>
<p><strong>laird</strong>: That’s a fair assessment of the
situation.</p>
<p><strong>distinct groups shouting at each other : gay rights</strong>:
ACTIVISTS in T-shirts with pink triangles, denouncing discrimination;
BORN AGAIN ACTIVISTS waving placards citing AIDS as God’s punishment for
homosexuality; POLICEMEN keeping them apart; A MEDIA CIRCUS getting it
on videotape.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: Do you see this as a gay rights
issue?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m not political. I just want compensation
for being fired.</p>
<p><strong>reporter medina</strong>: But you are gay, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: “I don’t see how that’s any of your
business… But yes, I am.”</p>
<p><strong>on the tv screen</strong>: A microphone is shoved at Joe.</p>
<p><strong>reporter medina</strong>: “Do you believe that homosexuals
deserve special treatment?”</p>
<p><strong>filko</strong>: Hell, no!</p>

<p><strong>on the tv screen</strong>: The REPORTER wraps up her
story.</p>
<p><strong>reporter medina</strong>: “This case is sending a cold chill
through the legal community. One of Wyant Wheeler’s key clients, the
Grace Foster Foundation, which supports several AIDS charities, has
taken its business to another firm until this matter is resolved…”</p>
<p><strong>filko</strong>: Hey, Joe. You’re not starting to get a
little… light on your feet here on us, are you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah, Filko. I am. I’m on the prowl, Filko. I
need a man. Not just any man. I need a hunk. A hunk like you. How about
it, Filko? Want to play sailor? This time, I’ll be first mate and you
can be Columbus.</p>
<p><strong>filko</strong>: Chill out, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Those people make me sick, Filko! But a law’s
been broken, okay? The law. Remember the law?</p>
<p><strong>charlie the cop</strong>: At least we agree on one thing,
Joe… They make me sick too.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter medina</strong>: “… now the public knows that
your son has AIDS and he’s gay. How does that make you feel?”</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: “This is a world full of war, famine,
poverty, homelessness… and people make a fuss because two men or two
women want to live together, or make love. Seems kind of silly, doesn’t
it?”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: And Walter Kenton knew the lesions on your face
and arms were caused by AIDS?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Definitely. People were going around,
whispering things. I figured I didn’t have anything to lose, so I told
all the partners.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How did Walter Kenton treat you, after you told
him you had AIDS?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Every time he came into contact with me, he’d
get this look on his face. I called it, the “Oh God” expression. As in
“Oh God, here comes that woman with</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ms. Torres? Have your employers fired you for
having AIDS?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No. When I need time off, for medical
reasons, we work it out.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thank you. No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>jerome green</strong>: Miss Torres. How did you contract the
AIDS virus?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: During a transfusion. I lost a lot of blood
giving birth to my second child.</p>
<p><strong>jerome green</strong>: In other words, in your case you
happen to be an innocent victim of the AIDS tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Look. I’m no different from everyone else who
has this disease: I’m not guilty, I’m not innocent. I’m just trying to
survive.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beyond noticing the marks on his face, were
there other things about his appearance that made you suspect he had</p>
<p><strong>the witness</strong>: Paralegal Anthea Burton.</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: He was losing weight. He looked kind of
tired sometimes. But he was working so hard… Still, I felt something was
wrong. And I can’t believe they’re saying they didn’t notice
anything.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Objection.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Just answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ms. Burton. You’re black.</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Is that a question?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No. Have you ever felt discriminated against,
at Wyant Wheeler?</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: In what way?</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Well… One time, Mr. Wheeler’s secretary,
Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your earrings?</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too…
“ethnic” is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore
something smaller, less garish, and… more “American.”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: I said my earrings are American. They’re
African-American.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thank you. No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant
Wheeler?</p>
<p><strong>anthea</strong>: Yes.</p>

No.</p>

Suddenly Counsel is attacking his own witness. Mr. Collins’ sexual
orientation has absolutely no relevance to this case.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: I said, HOLD IT! Mr. Miller. Could
you kindly share with me exactly what’s going on in your brain, because
I don’t have a clue at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your Honor, everyone in this courtroom is
thinking about sexual preference, sexual orientation, whatever you want
to call it. They’re looking at me, and wondering about it… They’re
looking at Mr. Beckett, and wondering about it. They’re looking at
Mr. Wheeler and wondering about it. They might even be looking at you
and wondering about it. So, let’s get it out in the open. Let’s talk
about what this case is really about: the general public’s hatred… our
loathing, our fear of homosexuals.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: In this courtroom, Mr. Miller,
justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual
orientation.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: With all due respect, Your Honor… We don’t live
in this courtroom, do we?</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: No. We don’t… However, as regards
this witness, I’m going to sustain the defense’s objection.</p>

the biggie?</p>
<p><strong>rock musician juror</strong>: Everybody has a couple of gay
friends. Don’t you?</p>

<p><strong>rock musician juror</strong>: You might have them, and just
not know they’re gay.</p>

to sea, without stopping at port?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Anywhere from two weeks, to several
months.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Any women on board?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Not when I was in the Navy.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So during those long voyages, months at a time,
out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young
men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites,
desires, their god- given, hormonal instincts… Anything going on?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Going on… like…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Like… two sailors playing hide the salami.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Mr. Miller!</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: We had one guy like that.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You haven’t ruled on my objection, Your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Let’s continue.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You had one guy “like that?”</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Yeah. But we took care of him.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten
of us had used it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You taught him a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: Yes, we did.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a
lesson?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’ll withdraw. You were aware, when you worked
with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: She didn’t try to conceal it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So you are aware of the difference between a
lesion and a bruise, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: I know the difference. That doesn’t mean I’m
always able to recognize the difference.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: But didn’t you avoid contact with Ms. Torres,
after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and
you avoided her, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: I felt, and still feel, nothing but the
deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have
contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.</p>
<p><strong>in the kitchen of their apartment, miguel pours
medicine</strong>: into an IV drip unit …</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Drew! Are you ready? If we start at eight,
we’ll be done by twelve.</p>
<p><strong>andrew sits at the diningroom table, making notes on a
legal</strong>: pad, holding out his left arm . A catheter is imbedded
into Andrew’s arm, and Miguel is trying to get the IV drip started
through the catheter. The MUSIC is lower…</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: It’s not going through.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: We’ll have to flush it again.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Hold still. Shit. The goddamn vein’s
clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the
goddamn catheter.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I have too much work to do. Skip the
treatment.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: We’re not skipping this treatment.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I said, skip it, Michael. It’s my
treatment.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Fuck you. This shit’s probably not doing me
any good anyway.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: That shit’s saving your life, you
asshole!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Close the law book.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m not going to close the–</p>
<p><strong>allright it’s closed!</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: The least you can do is look at me, while
I’m sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour
a day, and give me a little of your time.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You don’t think there’s much time left, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: That’s not what I said.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You’re scared. You think we’re near the
end.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Maybe I should start making plans, is that
what you think? Start planning my memorial service? “Begin to prepare
for the inevitable.”</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Maybe you should think about it.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What’s that mean?!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Maybe you should think about it.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m not going to die.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: That’s right. We’re on the Positive Plan.
You don’t have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You want me to give up? Let this thing turn
us into victims?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Then, what are we, Drew?! The winners?
“Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett
and his lover Miguel…” Excuse me, I’m not your lover. I’m your Care
Partner.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m not ready to die.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Do you think I’m ready for it?! I hate this
shit. I’m not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Please don’t leave me. I love you so much.
Don’t die, don’t leave me, please…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I am so scared. I am so fucking, incredibly,
fucking scared…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You know, there’s only one thing to do. We
have to have a party.</p>
<p><strong>joe and lisa stand outside andrew’s apartment – in
costume.</strong>: DANCE MUSIC is playing inside …</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Did I ever tell you, I hate costume
parties?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: My lettuce is wilting.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We’re friends of Beckett’s.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: It’s me, you dork.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m Lisa Miller.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Glad to finally meet you. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I have to introduce you to the can of soup.
You can enter the costume contest together as a lunch special.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: My sister, Maria. Pastrami on rye?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Corned beef.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Want to dance?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beckett. You seem… better. Energized, more
alive…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I had a blood transfusion today. I feel
great.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m a law suit.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Get it?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Let’s find you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Excuse me, I’m having a goddamn party, is
that allright with you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Sure. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No, we have to do it. But later,
allright?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>la toya</strong>: ’Scuse me, darling.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You think I’m uncomfortable…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>marie antoinette</strong>: I’m an accountant. What do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m a lawyer. That’s my wife!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Have a cocktail wienie.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thanks, Sarah. Nice costume.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: It’s not a costume, I just got off work.
You’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s my wife. Want to see a picture of my
baby?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Absolutely. Want to see a picture of my
baby?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’ll see you in an hour, max.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Night, honey.</p>
<p><strong>nun/marie antoinette/la toya</strong>: Night, Joe!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Congratulations, Miller.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You survived your first gay party
intact.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Let me tell you something, okay? When you’re
brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up,
there’s not a whole lot of discussion about… homosexuals. As a kid,
you’re taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny,
they’re a danger to kids, they’re afraid to fight, and they all want to
cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out
there, if you want to know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Let’s review these notes for your testimony. We
have a big day on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to
show how you’d been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered
one of them.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Beckett?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Charles. Okay. Miller?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Do you… pray?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Then we establish how Wheeler’s boys recruited
you after law school…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What have you prayed for?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through
the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: There’s a possibility I won’t be around for
the end of this trial.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’ve considered that.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What happens?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: We proceed, representing your estate.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’ve made provisions in my will for some
charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it’s not your area…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I know a good probate lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Thanks. Do you like opera?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Opera?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Want to hear my favorite aria?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Opera?</p>
<p><strong>suddenly, an aria by maria callas fills the room –</strong>:
startling Joe with its VOLUME.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Andrea Chenier, by Giordano. This is
Madeleine. She’s telling how, during the French revolution, a mob set
fire to her house. Her mother died, saving her.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: “It was during that sorrow that love came to
me!</p>
<p><strong>angle on joe</strong>: Shifting, uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: “I am Oblivion! I am Glory! I am Love, Love,
Love!”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I think I’ll… I told Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’ll look over the Q and A.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’re ready, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>andrew moves through the room, drinking in the
beautiful,</strong>: passionate MUSIC …</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Fucking guy…</p>
<p><strong>andrew moving through shadows, in the apartment, letting
the</strong>: MUSIC pull him along …</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “Plaintiff’s case. day fourteen.”</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Place your left hand on the Bible and raise
your right hand.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: “Do you swear to tell the truth…</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Wyant Wheeler had aggressively recruited me.
They were the most prestigious firm in Philadelphia, full of
opportunity. And I was impressed by the partners.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Including Charles Wheeler?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Particularly, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What impressed you about him?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: He was… the kind of person I thought I
wanted to be.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What kind of person is that?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of
the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing
out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most
complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the
street. The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn’t
sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous
spirit.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Obviously, at this time, you weren’t sick.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: It’s possible I was infected with the HIV
virus at that time, but I wasn’t diagnosed until several years
later.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You didn’t look then, the way you look now?</p>
<p><strong>reverse – on andrew in the witness stand, but now he
looks</strong>: COMPLETELY DIFFERENT</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No. I was thirty pounds heavier. I was
athletic.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: A regular all-American guy?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I suppose you could say that.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Except… you were gay?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I still am.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did
you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No. I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Can you explain why you didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: You don’t bring your personal life into a
law firm. You’re not supposed to have a personal life, really. Anyway, I
did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at
the tennis club…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Longstreet’s interested in the Harrisburg
deal.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m seeing him this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: “Somebody started telling jokes.”</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: What do you call a woman who has PMS and
ESP at the same time?.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: A bitch who knows everything.</p>
<p><strong>charles wheeler</strong>: How does a faggot fake an
orgasm?</p>
<p><strong>charles wheeler</strong>: He spits on your back.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Charles, that’s revolting!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How did that make you feel?</p>
<p><strong>image</strong>: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS
STAND .</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Relieved. That I’d never told him I was gay.
Very relieved.</p>
<p><strong>angle on charles wheeler</strong>: shakes his head, a
denial.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Are you a good lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’m an excellent lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What makes you an excellent lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I love the law. I know the law. I excel at
practicing it. It’s the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What do you love about it?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Well… many things. But I think the thing I
love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but
occasionally… you get to be part of justice being done. It’s really
quite a thrill when that happens.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You said earlier you aspired to be the kind
of person who had “an adventurous spirit.” Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Do you take risks?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have
to.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: In general. Do you take risks in other
areas of your life?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Not unnecessary ones.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on
Sansom Street?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: A few times.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: What kind of movies do they show there?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Gay movies.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Gay pornographic movies?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Do men have sex with each other in that
theater?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: How about you, Mr. Beckett?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: … Have you ever had sex with someone in
that theater?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Once.</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: I’m Robert.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Andrew.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Now what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I think we’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: When? Approximately what year did this
event take place?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I guess it was 1984, 85.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there
was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract
it through sexual activity?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: It’s impossible to know exactly when or how
I was infected with HIV.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: But you were having anonymous sex in porno
theaters in 1984 and 1985?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: That happened once. People weren’t talking
about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You’d heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’d heard of something. The gay plague, gay
cancer, but… we didn’t know how you could get it, or that it could kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Do you need a break?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler,
you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active
homosexual, correct?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: That is not correct. I never lied about
it.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Did you keep a picture of your lover on
your desk?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures
of their spouses or fiances on their desks?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Some do. I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: As a homosexual, one is often forced to
conceal one’s sexuality, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: In some situations.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Isn’t it true you have spent your life
pretending to be something you’re not, so much so that the art of
concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I’ll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you
living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous
sexual encounter in the porn theater?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You could have infected him, isn’t that
right?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we
weren’t aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You’ve testified the lesions on your face
were visible to the people you worked with, correct?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: And it’s your contention, that when the
partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion
you had AIDS and fired you.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Do you have any lesions on your face at
this time?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: One. Here, in front of my ear.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Remembering you are under oath, answering
truthfully, can you see the lesion on your face, in this mirror, three
feet away? Answering truthfully.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: By the time I was fired, there were four
lesions on my face, much bigger…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Answer the question, please.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: No. I can’t really see it.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: This would be a good time to break
for the day…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in
re-direct?</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Beckett?</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Can you go on for ten minutes?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I only need five! May I?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Do you have any lesions on any part of your
body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at
the time you were fired?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes. On my torso.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: If it please the court, I’d like to ask
Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate
idea of what we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly
influence the jury.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his
illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it
outside? We’re talking about AIDS, we’re talking about lesions. Let’s
see what we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: I’ll allow it. Would you mind
removing your shirt, Mr. Beckett?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Allright.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Can you see the lesions on your chest in this
mirror?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: I’ve discovered something interesting,
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: … keep them from that area, on grounds of
relevancy. What, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: No matter how hard I try, I can’t lose a
file in my computer.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: The system automatically makes a
backup.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I don’t think I should hear this.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: You can erase the backup… But why would
you?</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: What’s the point, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Very interesting, Bob. Let’s make a note of
that. Andy didn’t lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it
in. He lied about that, too.</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Charles…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: If you feel differently, Bob, you should
say so, when you’re called to the stand. After all, this isn’t a
conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett to your
firm?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: If you’re the owner of a major league ball
club, you recruit the hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously promising as
a young attorney. That’s why we went after him, that’s why we hired him,
and that’s why we stuck with him, year after year… waiting for the
promise to be fulfilled. But it never was.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You kept giving him another chance?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Of course we did. When you’ve groomed
someone they way we groomed Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all kinds of
special treatment on him… you’ve made quite an investment. We were
waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver. But, ultimately, we
could no longer ignore the gap between the promise and the reality… This
is one of the saddest times in my life. To sit in this court, testifying
to Andy’s ultimate failure to make the grade. To discover that he is one
of those people who wants to benefit by the system, but doesn’t want to
play by the system’s rules. To think you know someone, only to find out…
you don’t know them at all. It’s heartbreaking.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Thank you. That’s all for now, Your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge garnett</strong>: Mr. Miller?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain
this to me like I’m a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease,
is that what you’re saying? Not about your understandable, if unfounded,
fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it?
You’re saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett’s character. Am I
getting this right?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Yes, character. To the extent that it
affects a person’s ability to do a great job.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Andy worked when he wanted to work, telling
us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I didn’t mind covering for Andy, but I did
wonder… when was he planning to deal with his problem?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: Sometimes it seems like society is run by
these kinds of people.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What kind of people?</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: People who want to bend the rules…</p>
<p><strong>killcoyne</strong>: If you want to be a leader in this
society, you have to make certain sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: … to suit their personal desires, and the
rest of us have to live with it.</p>
<p><strong>kenton</strong>: You have to make a decision: is this guy
partner material?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler? You?</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: Yes, I did see the lesions. I suspected he
was sick…</p>
<p><strong>close on andrew</strong>: closing his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: The everyday, common person with decent
values…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It seems like he wasn’t willing to face the
reality of his situation…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: I didn’t tell the others, I was afraid
to…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: … But now, we’re standing up for
ourselves…</p>
<p><strong>seidman</strong>: … But we shouldn’t have fired him…</p>
<p><strong>wheeler</strong>: … It’s time to get this society back on
track!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Could you call an ambulance, please?</p>
<p><strong>a crisis in a hospital room … medical staff</strong>: working
frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE
BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The tube they’re trying to put in place
seems to be making matters worse.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: It’s making it worse. Take it out. Take it
out!</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “Two weeks later.”</p>
<p><strong>lesbian juror</strong>: If he was “mediocre,” why did they
gave him this major assignment three weeks before they fired him?</p>
<p><strong>postal worker juror</strong>: They were testing him.</p>
<p><strong>jurors sitting around a long table in a room with
tall,</strong>: grimy windows …</p>
<p><strong>title</strong>: “Jury deliberations.”</p>
<p><strong>waitress juror</strong>: They wanted to see if he’d rise to
the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher juror</strong>: They wanted to give him a final
chance.</p>
<p><strong>postal worker juror</strong>: Makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>businessman juror</strong>: I’d still love to know what
happened to that missing file.</p>
<p><strong>homemaker juror</strong>: Wouldn’t we all?</p>
<p><strong>postal worker juror</strong>: Ask the computer.</p>
<p><strong>college student juror</strong>: They say he wasn’t competent.
But, you heard him on the stand.</p>
<p><strong>rock musician juror</strong>: He sounded pretty smart to
me.</p>
<p><strong>businessman juror</strong>: Why would they fire him? Why not
a medical leave, or…</p>
<p><strong>college student juror</strong>: They freaked out over the
AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>schoolteacher juror</strong>: They hate homosexuals.</p>
<p><strong>businessman juror</strong>: It’s not against the law to
disapprove of homosexuals.</p>
<p><strong>lesbian juror</strong>: It is against the law to fire someone
for having AIDS. That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>businessman juror</strong>: You’re the foreman. You haven’t
said anything. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>marine juror</strong>: They’re saying he wasn’t a good

important lawsuit they’d ever had, for one of their most important
clients… they say that doesn’t prove anything, because that was just a
test. What did they call it? A carrot. To see if he’d rise to the
occasion… Okay… Say I’ve got to send a pilot into enemy territory, and
he’s gonna be flying a plane that cost 350 million dollars… Who am I
going to put into that plane? A rookie who can’t cut the grade, because
I want to see if he’ll rise to the challenge? Or am I going to give that
assignment to my best pilot, my most experienced, my sharpest, my top
gun… The very best I’ve got?</p>

me… like I’m a six year old?</p>

and humiliation… we give no award.</p>

million, eight hundred and eighty two thousand dollars.</p>
