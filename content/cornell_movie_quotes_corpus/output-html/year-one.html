<h1 id="year-one">year-one</h1>
<p><strong>the big bang</strong>: A blinding flash of light as the
singularity explodes, particles expanding in all directions until they
fill the screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust. Then the
particles start to attract one another to form atoms, the atoms
elements, the elements form molecules, the molecules compounds, the
compounds cells, then a cell twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts
booming out a Dolby heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of
organisms. Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a
much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and pull back to
reveal–</p>
<p><strong>the sea 2</strong>: Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore,
brilliant sun rising in a cloudless azure sky. A WOMAN emerges from the
sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit to obscure her nudity, but we can
see she is full-breasted, long-limbed, toned and tanned– perfection.
Then a MAN rises up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily
in the surf. Even in silhouette we can see he’s far from perfect– short,
overweight. They turn to each other and embrace. It’s paradise– for
him.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: I’m so hungry.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Yeah. Me, too. The DRUMS get hotter as he
closes his eyes and leans in to kiss her, but she turns and walks
away.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What should we eat?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Oh, you actually meant you were hungry. I
thought– forget it.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Mmmm, these are so good.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Mmrrunm, they really are . When she turns
away he spits them out in disgust. Maya smiles and puts her face very
close to his, their lips almost touching.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You know what I’d really like?</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Some fruit.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, fruit’s good. You want an apple or a pear?</p>
<p>****: No. He scans the nearby trees.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Orange? Tangerine? Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach? She
shakes her head coyly. He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully
pointing out various options. She follows him.</p>
<p>****: Nuh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, don’t tell me– papaya? Pomegranate?
Lemon? Lime? Kumquat? Uh, cock? Cockfruit?</p>
<p><strong>nooo–</strong>: The game is no longer cute but he still plays
along.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Watermelon? Honeydew? Grapes?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Starfruit, casaba– tangelo?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p>****: Okay, I give up. Which fruit do you want?</p>
<p>****: That one. Zed looks. It’s a beautiful tree with lush,
apple-like red fruit hanging from it.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Because that’s the fruit we don’t eat! It’s
forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Because we don’t! It’s a rule! That’s the Tree
of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. You don’t eat from that one. Nobody
ever has.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Stop saying why not! I told you– it’s a
rule.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So do you always follow the rules?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No– yeah– I don’t know. We don’t have that many
rules. In fact, we only have one rule– DON’T EAT THAT</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Okay, fine. We won’t. Forget I mentioned it. I
understand if you’re afraid–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’m not “afraid”–</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: No, really, it’s all right. I just thought you
might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks, crawls,
swims, flies, or grows in the ground, but not that particular fruit. And
I thought you might be the kind of man who’s willing to take a chance
and start thinking for himself, but I guess I was wrong. She glares
defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It’s not Paradise anymore.
Then like every man that ever lived and will ever live, he caves.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay! Fine! You want to try the Good and Evil
fruit, you got it. He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and
hands her one. They both stare at the fruit.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No way! It was your idea. You go first.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: We both bite at the same time. Zed considers
for a long moment then decides.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay. Ready? One– two– three! Zed chomps down
hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him out and stops before her
teeth break the skin. ZED Got me. That’s a good move. I’m going to steal
it. He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste of Good
and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he spits it out. ZED
Yuchh! That’s horrible. Yecch, ptui! Ughh. He frantically wipes the
inside of his mouth with his fingers, trying to get the terrible taste
out.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So you’re saying it’s not good?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes! I’m saying it’s not good! He grabs his
belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a loud bowel sound and his
eyebrows shoot up. ZED Oh, no–</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Ooh, banana!</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Thank you, Marlak.</p>
<p><strong>4 zed’s hut</strong>: Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides
in front of his hut, his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next
to him sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy, jealous of
the attention they’re getting from the women. If Zed is over-confident
and reckless, Oh is his polar opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the
kind of guy who would apologize if you poked him in the ass with your
spear. He may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been invented
he’d be wearing them.</p>
<p>****: Look at them. Hunters think they’re so cool. They don’t think
gathering is dangerous? There are thorns– bees– those big stingy ants. I
could hunt– I just don’t want to. And what’s with the blood on their
faces? They think that’s sanitary?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Do me a favor. Just kill me.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Why did you eat that fruit? It’s forbidden.
Everybody knows that.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I couldn’t help myself! Maya was just staring
at me with those pouty eyes– and those perky breasts– opposable thumbs.
And how about the name? “The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil”?
You don’t think that sounds tempting? They should’ve just called it “The
Tree with the Fruit that Tastes Like Shit.” Then for sure nobody would
eat it. Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind his
dwelling. ZED Hey! Squanto! Give me a break, would ya’! You got the
whole forest! Why does everyone have to crap right behind my hut?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I think, and I could be wrong, that all the poop
makes the ground more fertile, which in turn, gives the leaves in the
area a softer feel. It’s a vicious circle. Oh notices a very pretty
young woman, EEMA, standing near the communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His
heart leaps. OH Hi, Eema! Eema turns, sees it’s him and gives him a
perfunctory wave, then turns back to the hunters and says something
about Oh that makes them laugh.</p>
<p>****: I want to lay with her so badly.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t see it. I mean she’s cute, but I don’t
think I’d lay with her.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Of course not! She’s your sister! It’d be like
sleeping with your mother.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: which was a big mistake. I see that now. You
think it won’t be awkward the next morning but– trust me, you just want
to rip your eyeballs out. Listen, if you want to impress Eema, tonight
at the feast, do the fertility dance with her, then drag her back to
your hut.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: My hut’s a mess. And what if she struggles?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: So you give her a little tap on the head. Women
respond to that–</p>
<p>****: No. She only likes hunters– not gatherers. They look over at
Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft of a hunter’s spear.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I wouldn’t read too much into that. She kisses,
then tongues the spear tip. ZED Okay, that might mean something. The
hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He’s clearly half a rung lower on the
human evolutionary scale.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: You didn’t hunt today.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I was indisposed.
Got that intestinal thing that’s been going around. Marlak grunts and
examines the primitive line drawings on the walls of Zed’s hut.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: What’s that supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: It’s a bear.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: That’s not a bear. That’s just some lines on
a skin.</p>
<p>****: It’s not a real bear. It’s a “representation” of a bear. You
know, a “picture.”</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: That’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah. Like you’d know.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: And what’s that? He picks up a skin with
another of Zed’s drawings on it, this one of a big-breasted naked girl.
Zed quickly grabs it and holds it upside down.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That– would be an antelope– or a deer– a
deerpalope.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: It looks like Maya.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: How could it be Maya? It’s just some lines on a
skin.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Stay away from my woman.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Your woman? I’m not sure dragging her into the
bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual “thing” going.
Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Stay away.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey! Nice supra-orbital ridge, fartface!</p>
<p><strong>5 a roaring fire</strong>: The DRUMS kick up another notch as
the huge boar roasts on a spit over a roaring fire.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey, Oh? Did it ever occur to you that there
may be more to life than this?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Okay, I think somebody’s had enough.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, I’m serious.We’re born into thisworld, we
hunt, we gather, we eat,we sleep, we make babies–</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You make babies–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: –but why? What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You always get like this when you smoke. Oh
takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing
uncontrollably.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No. Last night I couldn’t sleep, so I just laid
there looking up at the sky, counting the stars. There were over
seventy. Kinda makes you think, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really? I’ve been thinking about it ever since
I ate that fruit. Don’t you ever wonder what’s on the other side of the
mountains?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: There’s nothing on the other side of the
mountains. Everybody knows that. The world just ends. You’d fall right
off the edge.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: But what if it doesn’t? What if it just goes on
and on forever? Or what if it’s round?</p>
<p>****: And if you keep walking you eventually come right back to where
you started? He traces the circumference with his finger.</p>
<p>****: Oh, yeah, that’s plausible. Zed flings the rock away.</p>
<p><strong>a villager</strong>: Oww!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Will you stop with that crazy talk? We’re at a
feast. You love feasts. There’s women, there’s boar meat, there’s an
assortment of berries– there’s women– Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks
up on it.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Do it, man! Go dance for her.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You think? They’re playing the Jackal Dance. I
don’t do that one so well.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Are you kidding? Go! Jackal Dance! Oh summons
his courage, gets up and crosses to where the girls are sitting. Zed
makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows and licks his
lips. She laughs and looks away. Oh starts dancing timidly right in
front of Eema, subtly jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool. Eema just
stares at him for a moment, then goes back to talking to her friends. Oh
looks over at Zed for help. Zed mimes clonking her on the head. Oh picks
up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin. However, instead of
submitting, she gets really pissed, stands up and decks him with one
punch.</p>
<p><strong>6 the fire pit - minutes later</strong>: A hunter is slicing
off hunks of boar meat for the other tribesmen. Zed pushes through the
small crowd waiting for food and goes to the front.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Excuse me, hunter coming through.</p>
<p><strong>villagers</strong>: Hey! Wait your turn! There’s a line here,
buddy!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: For your information I was in line and I just
stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady. Suddenly a SPEAR is
thrust inches from his face, stopping him. It’s Marlak, who towers over
Zed. His cohort, ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the garden
with Maya.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh, really? And what if I called Enmebaragesi a
liar?</p>
<p><strong>enmebaragesi</strong>: I’d kill you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Calm down. I said “what if”– it was a
hypothetical. Marlak gets right in Zed’s face.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Enmebaragesi doesn’t lie. Villagers gather
around them, Maya and Eema among them. Marlak puts his spear point to
Zed’s throat. MARLAK The truth!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Zed, just admit it. You’re just making it
harder on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, you just made it harder on myself! Okay,
fine, you got me.</p>
<p>****: Maya and I lay together on occasion. We’re consenting adults
and we have an adventurous sexual relationship. Maya looks shocked, and
tries to signal Zed to shut up.</p>
<p>****: You laid with my woman?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Isn’t that what we’re talking about? Maya rolls
her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>enmebaragesi</strong>: No, I saw you eat the Forbidden
Fruit.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the fruit. I was just
kidding about humping Maya. Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The
DRUMMING stops. Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and
Zed.</p>
<p>****: Hey! What’s going on? Marlak growls at him. OH</p>
<p>****: Oooh, shooting star.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Look, Marlak, this is crazy. You’re two of me.
I’m not gonna fight you over a girl, okay? Zed starts to walk away but
quickly pivots and throws a WILD HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it,
and it hits an unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose. Zed And
let that be a lesson to your big friend- Marlak grabs Zed, lands two
solid punches to Zed’s mid- section, and then clocks him with a vicious
right that sends him sprawling to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Your father was a great hunter, but you’re
like– a girl. The hunters laugh.</p>
<p><strong>enmebaragesi</strong>: Good one, Marlak.</p>
<p><strong>another hunter</strong>: Zing.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Now I kill you. He’s about to spear Zed when
suddenly the Shaman screams and jumps between them. The villagers step
back as the Shaman howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at
Zed.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>7 the campfire - minutes later 7</strong>: Zed and the Shaman
sit side by side on a log, talking privately.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: You really ate the fruit?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: One bite! What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: chicken-foot rattle at</p>
<p>****: You don’t eat the fruit! That’s been the number one rule from
the beginning of time. Since the Great Turtle climbed from the sea with
the Earth on his back, drank the ocean, pooped out the mountains and the
first man fell from the stars.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’ve always had trouble with the Great Turtle
Theory– too many unexplained gaps.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: Whatever. You’re screwed now.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really? How screwed? Like I knew it was a rule
but I’m a little fuzzy on the exact details.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: You’re cursed, man, and if you stay here
then we’ll all be cursed. You have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Where am I supposed to go?</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: Up to you. From now on you’re completely on
your own.</p>
<p>****: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: You should probably get going now. You
better take this knife. He hands him a flint knife with a
leather-wrapped handle. SHAMAN And some of the guys got together and
they want you to have this bow. He hands him a strong hunter’s bow.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t want to seem ungrateful or anything,
but you wouldn’t happen to have any arrows, would you? An arrow zips in
and sticks in the post next to his head.</p>
<p><strong>shaman</strong>: You’d better get moving. Zed looks around at
his fellow villagers, trying to summon what dignity he has left.</p>
<p>****: Okay, but before I go I just want to say something. I know I’m
not the greatest hunter–</p>
<p><strong>villager</strong>: –Or gatherer–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes, or gatherer– but there’s got to be more to
life than this– Kinda hard to concentrate with that rhythmic drumming,
fellas. The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed.
ZED Anyways, I’m going away, not because you’re forcing me to– which you
are– but because I choose to. Yes, I ate from the Tree of the Knowledge
of Good and Evil– major misunderstanding on my part– and believe me I’m
not recommending it unless you’re interested in a very powerful
laxative– but it got me thinking about some pretty heavy stuff – life
questions, you know. So I’m out of here, and anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak
staring at her and averts her eyes. ZED</p>
<p><strong>anyone–</strong>: Zed looks at oh, who suddenly becomes very
interested in an imaginary piece of loincloth lint. ZED I don’t know
where we’re going or when we’re going to get there, but I will lead the
way–</p>
<p>****: lighting up the darkness– pointing us in the right direction,
and keeping us entertained with humorous anecdotes from my childhood.
Now who’s with me? He enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air.</p>
<p><strong>me–</strong>: –better, in fact, because having a partner
would just slow me down. Oh can’t look at him. Zed shakes his head,
failing to notice that the torch he’s holding has ignited the roof of
the hut next to him. The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing
roof. ZED Oops! They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to
roof. ZED I know there’s a lesson in here somewhere. Any thoughts? The
villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts. It’s chaos.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Now you die. Marlak throws his spear and
misses as Zed takes off running into the forest with the hunters right
behind him and the whole village ablaze.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: I see you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: How can you see me if I’m not here?</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: You’re trying to trick me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, then tell me this– who’s standing right
behind you?</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: You think I’m going to turn around and look,
but I’m not. I’m going to gut you like a pig. He is about to plunge his
knife into Zed when suddenly he is struck from behind by a heavy tree
branch. He falls heavily, knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over
him with the makeshift club. Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at
Oh.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I guess I’m with you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Was it my speech?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: No, the fire. I lost everything.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: But the speech was pretty good, right? I mean,
even I was moved and I was the one speaking.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Can we talk about this later? Oh pulls Zed to
his feet, and they sneak off into the deep woods.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: This is nice, out here, the two of us.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, it’s great.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Come on, those hunters are idiots. In an hour
they’ll forget the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I don’t think they’ll forget the fire.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You know what we should do? You and me should
kill the biggest boar ever– just huge!– and take it back to the village.
Just to show them. And we won’t let anyone else eat it. They’ll have to
watch us eat it.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: If it’s that huge how would we carry it
back?</p>
<p>****: Fine, we’ll just start with something small. A squirrel or
something.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Yeah, we’ll make everyone watch us eat a
squirrel. Will you get real? There’s no going back! There’s, nothing to
go back to! It’s just ashes.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, like it’s so hard to build a new hut. It’s just a pile of
sticks and dung–</p>
<p>****: You’re a pile of sticks and dung. Suddenly, Zed stops and
stands perfectly still.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: What are you doing? Zed makes a minimal gesture
with his head. Oh looks up. A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them,
poised to leap. Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Don’t move a muscle.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Will that work?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t know. There’s two different opinions on
this one. Some say run, some say don’t.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’m going to– RUN! He sprints off and the
cougar pounces right on oh.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You really should put some maggots on those
scratches. They look pretty deep.</p>
<p>****: I just want to know why you told me not to move, and you
ran.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Because I honestly thought he’d go for me. I
thought I was doing you a favor. Apparently not appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Yeah, big favor.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You didn’t have to come with me, you know. I
didn’t ask you to come.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Yes, you did! You looked right at me– twice.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes, that’s a technique of public speaking, but
I didn’t ask you specifically. You chose to come. You gotta take some
responsibility for that. And there’s no point coming if you’re just
gonna keep whining about every little– cougar that attacks you. You want
some or not?</p>
<p>****: No, eat your weasel. You deserve it. He turns his back to Zed,
and starts sorting through the pile of sticks.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You making your own fire?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: No, arrows. We’re going to need them.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You’re still coming?</p>
<p>****: Yes. Zed claps him on the back and hugs him exuberantly. Oh
winces in pain.</p>
<p><strong>12 the mountains - later 12</strong>: Zed and Oh climbing
higher now. Finally, they reach the top and look out at the vista. From
their vantage point they can see a high plateau and wooded land
stretching far beyond it.</p>
<p>****: I knew it! Still think you’re just gonna fall off the edge of
the world?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Incredible. He takes a step forward, the rock
shelf gives way beneath his feet and he falls a great distance,
screaming all the way down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders,
then a long, tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the
bottom.</p>
<p>****: Oooh. - I’ll go around! Wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Say what you want, but that was no accident.
You don’t see a pattern here?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I see a pattern. Every time something terrible
can happen to me, it does.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah, but why? Why’d the cougar go for you and
not me? Why did you fall and I didn’t? Hard to believe it’s all just
random. Think about</p>
<p><strong>it–</strong>: ia htintI! f 1 inWROM m 11W, 10 looks around
the forest clearing for subtle signs. ZED People– more than one–
walking– that way.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You think? There’s about a thousand footprints
here.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes! There! He drops to one knee and examines
something in the bushes. Zed They stopped here to poop. Look.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Four men, maybe five. And a child– or a small
women maybe.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Looks like they had some nuts– dried fruit–
some kind of green leafy vegetable–</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Okay! Enough! Can we just go? Maybe we can find
where they peed. 14 Then Zed sees light through the trees and creeps 14
stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and they peer
through the bushes. THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond
it, well- tended fields of growing grain. Zed snaps into stalking mode,
ducks down and silently signals Oh to be quiet and stay put.</p>
<p>****: This one’s mine. He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his
quiver, and slowly draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows.
He shoots. The blunt, pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and
bounces off. The cow looks up.</p>
<p><strong>first young farmer</strong>: Did you just shoot my cow?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, well– we’re hunters.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: He’s a hunter. I’m more of a “maker.” I made
this loincloth, I do arrows– I made a shelf unit for my hut–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What do you guys do?</p>
<p><strong>second young farmer</strong>: What does it look like? We’re
farmers.</p>
<p><strong>first young farmer</strong>: He’s a farmer; I’m a
herdsman.</p>
<p><strong>second young farmer</strong>: You’re a suck, is what you
are.</p>
<p><strong>first young farmer</strong>: My brother, Cain. I am called
Abel.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: You are called suck.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: My brother is angry because God looked on my
sacrifice with favor.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: “God looked on my sacrifice with</p>
<p><strong>favor–“</strong>: Okay, is he a total suck or what?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Well, it’s hard to say– we just</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Why are you dragging them into this? What do
they know? They’re morons.</p>
<p>****: Hey! Easy!</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: You think you’re so superior to everyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Superior-er than you.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Really? Let’s see how good you are at getting
your ass kicked.</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Yeah? Bring it!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, boys, that’s enough. We just want to–</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: No! This smug asshole insulted you and I want
him to take it back.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We’re not really that insulted–</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Take it back!</p>
<p><strong>abel</strong>: Make me! Zed steps between them, trying to
make peace.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Boys, boys! You’re brothers! Let’s just relax
and– Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight is on.
They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and wrestle each other to
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Shouldn’t we do something?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Just let them settle it. Cain picks up a
good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head with all his might. Abel
falls heavily to the ground and lies there, not moving. Cain stands over
him, breathing hard. ZED</p>
<p>****: I guess that settles it.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: still holding the bloody</p>
<p>****: What?!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Nothing! Cain stares at Abel, still inert on
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: He’s all right. Probably just</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Probably just tuckered out from the fight.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey! What do you mean “we”? I don’t want to
play the blame game, but you’re the one who hit him.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: You could’ve stopped me! There’s two of you
and only one of me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We didn’t know you were going to kill him–</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: You calling me a murderer?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Did I say that?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: It was an accident! Right?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Right! You were holding the rock and he–
accidentally ran into it– really hard– with his head.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Okay– yeah– good. But it might be better if we
don’t mention the “accident” to anyone. People might get the wrong idea.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Oh, yeah, people could so easily misinterpret
that.</p>
<p>****: Why even bring it up?</p>
<p>****: I like you guys. You’re all right. Why don’t you come with me?
Have supper with the family.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Unfortunately we already have dinner plans.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: I think you should come with me.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: why don’t we go with you?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What are the big round things for?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: They’re wheels, numbskull. They make the cart
roll.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Wow! That is like the greatest invention since
the vagina. Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward. Oh screams as
the HEAVY WHEELS ROLL OVER HIS FEET.</p>
<p><strong>16 close on zed and oh 16</strong>: They look really
thrilled, wind blowing through their hair, their hands up like
roller-coaster riders.</p>
<p>****: Woooo! Woooo! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>the cart</strong>: with them riding on it, plodding slowly
into a FARMING HAMLET,°a cluster of small, roughly plastered mud houses
with thatched roofs. ADAM, dour, hard-working and long-suffering, but
still strong and upright, trudges home with a metal scythe over his
shoulder. He could be Max Von Sydow.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cain, my son!</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Hail, Father. Cain stops the cart and
dismounts with Zed and Oh. CAIN Can these guys stay for supper?</p>
<p>****: I bring strangers who would sojourn with us this night. Cain
turns to Zed and Oh and furtively mimes an elaborate lip- sewing
gesture, ancient precursor to the modern lip-zipper.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Greetings, strangers. I am called Adam and you
are welcome to share the fruits of our toil.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Thanks, but I’m kind of staying away from fruit
for the time being. Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam
ushers them into his crude dwelling.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where is thy brother, Abel?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Abel? Haven’t seen him. I thought he was with
you. You guys see him? They shake their heads and cough nervously.</p>
<p><strong>zed and oh</strong>: Nape. Not that I remember. Never seen
anybody– anywhere– anytime – ever.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Your sister Lilith said she saw him in the
field with you.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: I think that was yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, this day. She said you both made
offerings.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: That might’ve been Boaz—</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, you and Abel. She said it looked like you
were arguing.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Hey, we’re brothers, we argue sometimes- it’s
not that big a deal.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And his flock was untended in the</p>
<p>****: Okay! What am I– his keeper? Get off my back, will you? He
smashes his plate against the wall and storms out. An awkward silence as
Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I fear the worst for Abel. I am sorely
vexed.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah, that’s got to be pretty vexing. A
Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly on his sorry
circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: For my sin the ground is cursed. Thorns and
thistles does it sprout for us, and we are doomed to toil all the days
of our lives. For as the Lord has commanded, by the sweat of your brow
shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you
were taken. For dust you are, and to dust shall you return.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Wow. That’s kind of a downer isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s the way of the world.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Boy, I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You are welcome to stay the night and lay with
my daughter Lilith. Zed looks at the luscious Lilith, then back at
Adam.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’m waiting for the punchline.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She is without a husband, and as the Lord has
said, thou shalt be fruitful and multiply. Lilith nods demurely and
exits through a curtain. Zed starts to follow her out.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Hey! What about me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You may share the bed of my son Seth.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah, there you go. Oh looks at Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I multiplied with a sheep. My thingie smells
like lamb chops.</p>
<p><strong>lilith</strong>: My bed is small but you’re welcome to share
it. It’s the way of my people.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: And that’s a good way to be. In fact, I’m kind
of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway. I would’ve
thought guys would be lined up at the door.</p>
<p><strong>lilith</strong>: I don’t like men.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Maybe you just haven’t met the right one.</p>
<p><strong>lilith</strong>: I like girls.</p>
<p>****: So we have that in common–</p>
<p><strong>lilith</strong>: I’m attracted to women.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t even know what that means. What does
that mean?</p>
<p><strong>lilith</strong>: I like to have sex with other women.</p>
<p>****: I’m really not getting this. Lilith shakes her head, turns away
from him, and pulls up her blanket. Zed shrugs and rolls over to sleep.
They lie there quietly in the dark for a long beat. Then– Zed You’re
kidding! Whoa! That’s amazing!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oooh, listen to this one. Seth lifts his knees
to his chest and farts a surprisingly long cadenza.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: That’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Want to see a trick?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: It’s been the same damn thing my whole life.
“Why can’t you be more like Abel?” “Oh, your sacrifice was good, too,
but Abel’s was– wow!”</p>
<p>****: Your brother Seth is an interesting guy. Did you know he can
put his penis in his mouth? Adam and Zed come out of his dwelling.
KINSMEN from other dwellings start gathering.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cain!</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Yeah, hey– where’s everybody going?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: To look for Abel.</p>
<p>****: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: I said good luck. I’m really worried about
him. He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh’s
benefit.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’re not coming?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Yeah, I am. I just have to finish toiling over
here, then I’m right behind you. Adam and the others hurry off, and as
soon as they’re gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to
the cart. CAIN Now listen, I’m getting out of here, and you better come
with me. I have a feeling they’re going to try and blame this whole
“Abel- killing-thing” on you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why would they blame us?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Because when they find him and his head is all
bashed in, they’re going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are
drifters, so they’ll put two and two together and that makes– He stares
expectantly at Zed and Oh. CAIN Four! It makes four! Now stop asking so
many questions and hop on. We gotta get out of here! He urgently whips
the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward.</p>
<p><strong>cain–</strong>: After him! The farmers shout and race back to
the hamlet.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: They’re gaining on us! Zed and Oh look
back.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: The other oxcarts are a hundred yards
back, “chasing” them at maybe two miles per hour. Cain whips his oxen
and they step up the pace to 3 MPH.</p>
<p>****: Hah! They’ll never catch us now! An aerial view shows Cain’s
cart slowly pulling away from his pursuers. Suddenly a bolt of lightning
splits the bright blue sky and strikes Cain right on the forehead,
knocking him back into the cart. He sits up stunned, with a
still-smoking, jagged burn mark on his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Look at all these people! And this stuff! Oh
approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Can I have one of those? He reaches for a loaf
but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with a cane. OH Ow!</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: Two silver pieces.</p>
<p>****: We’re gonna need some money.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah, we’re gonna need money. What’s money?
They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around a raised
platform. SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform
while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned. The AUCTIONEER
brings up a fnuscular male slave in a loincloth. ZED It’s Marlak!
Marlak’s hands are bound and he’s restrained by a chain attached to a
thick leather collar around his neck.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Next up, an unusual item– looks like a
Caucasian– he’s big, he’s strong, he’s a good breeder, so I’m going to
start at 100 gold minas. Do I hear 100? As the bidding starts, Zed spots
Maya, his sister Eema, and Enmebaragesi among the chained-up slaves
waiting to be sold. Zed and Oh push their way through the crowd and go
to them.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Eema! Maya! The women embrace him with relief
and excitement.</p>
<p>****: Hi, Eema.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What happened? How did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well, after the fire– –the hill tribes raided
the village. The men fought them but they were too many. They took us
captive, marched us to the sea, then traded us to the boat people who
brought us here.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Are you all right? Did they– rape you?</p>
<p>****: Just a little. Zed and Oh look at her curiously. The SLAVE
TRADER sees them talking to Eema and approaches.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: You interested in some slaves?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah, this one looks pretty good– He starts
prodding, poking and squeezing Maya’s arm like he’s buying fruit. Oh
takes the opportunity to fondle Eema’s breasts. She punches him. Zed
Ooh, feisty! So how does this work if we want them? The slave trader
notes Zed’s peasant clothes.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: You have money?</p>
<p>****: Well, that depends on what you mean by money?</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: Look, pal, money talks and bullshit
walks. I don’t have time for looky- loos.</p>
<p>****: Perhaps I can help.</p>
<p>****: Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I can make a deal with him. You
guys wait here. Cain puts his arm around the slave trader’s shoulder and
walks him away. CAIN So what are we lookin’ at here? From a distance,
Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can’t hear what they’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: What an amazing coincidence– running into you
and Maya and them.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You still think it’s all just a coincidence?
All of us here right now, at this particular place, at this particular
time?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. Why do you think?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’m not sure yet, but I’m starting to believe
that everything happens for a reason. Like, why did I eat the forbidden
fruit?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: To get laid?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: which omnipotent force?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What do you mean “which” omnipotent force? How
many omnipotent forces could there be?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I don’t know! What’s “omnipotent” mean?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Work with me– I’m just speculating here. Let’s
call this force “God”; and let’s say this “God” is controlling
everything. Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and
evil.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Why would he want that?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: How do you know God’s a “He?” Zed rolls his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Don’t you get what I’m saying? What if we’ve
been chosen?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You think we’ve been chosen by God?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, no offense, but it’s possible that I was
chosen and you all just happened to be there.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Why would God choose you? Why wouldn’t he choose
Marlak? He’s stronger.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: A chosen doesn’t need to be strong. I’m big
this way.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You do have a fat face.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Not my face, my brain. It’s enormous. I’m the
smartest guy in the village.</p>
<p>****: You’re not even– I’m smarter than you!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What?! Which one of us is smarter?</p>
<p><strong>villager</strong>: You’re both idiots!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh yeah, then why are we free and you’re
chained up?</p>
<p><strong>villager</strong>: Because of you?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Hey! Come here. I think we worked something
out.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Sit tight. I’m going to get you out of here. Do
you trust me?</p>
<p>****: I want to trust you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Fair enough. She gives him an encouraging hug,
then Zed and Oh cross to Cain and the slave trader.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I never trusted that guy.</p>
<p>****: Why? Just ’cause he murdered his brother and got hit by
lightning? They are pushed to the front of the platform.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: All right! Next up is a twofer– I’m
selling them as a pair– I know they don’t look like much– but I’m
starting the bidding at sixty gold minas. Do I hear sixty?</p>
<p>****: Remember, it’s two for one here. Do I hear fifty? Anyone?
That’s only twenty-five apiece, folks.</p>
<p>****: Zed looks out at the crowd, starting to get offended. SLAVE
TRADER You’re breaking my heart here. How about forty? Do I hear
forty?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: It’s not like I want to be a slave or anything,
but this is embarrassing!</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: Thirty-five? Thirty?</p>
<p>****: Come on, people! We’re a steal at thirty!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: They probably don’t know how smart you think you
are. Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk and
waves it at the slave trader.</p>
<p><strong>slave trader</strong>: Yes! Sold to Sheikh Hassan for 30 gold
minas! Have a good time in the salt mines, boys.</p>
<p>****: Excuse me– I’m sorry– That’s not good– He jerks his hand away,
elbowing Marlak in the face.</p>
<p><strong>the other slaves</strong>: Ow! Hey! Cut that out! Zed tries
to turn his head to see who’s behind him.</p>
<p>****: Hey, pal! You can take your foot out of my ass anytime now.</p>
<p>****: And your foot is still there. If I turn around, you will be
sorry. Zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him
face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya. ZED That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: For you maybe.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Look, I want you to know I blame myself for
everything that happened.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So does everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Get away from my woman!</p>
<p>****: I don’t think that’s going to be possible. And I told you
before, she’s not “your woman.”</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: I’ll kill you! Marlak starts muscling and
squirming his way through the body pile trying to get to Zed.</p>
<p><strong>the other slaves</strong>: Hey! Watch it, jerk!</p>
<p>****: Why? Suddenly Zed feels Marlak’s hands around his neck,
grabbing him from behind. Zed struggles but Marlak manages to pull him
into a full headlock, forcing Zed’s face into his hairy armpit.</p>
<p>****: Ecchhh! Oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but can’t
move.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Hold on! I’m coming! Oh tries to maneuver to
Zed, but can’t move an inch. OH If everyone could just move to the
right. Please? Thank you in advance for your cooperation. You can do it,
Zed! Use his weight against him!</p>
<p><strong>bedouin</strong>: Knock it off! Don’t make me come in
there!</p>
<p>****: I’d like to see you try. The Bedouin is just about to respond
when suddenly A METAL TIPPED ARROW FLIES IN AND PIERCES HIS THROAT. He
drops to the sand, dead.</p>
<p><strong>a battle chariot</strong>: comes flying over the crest of the
wadi followed by TWENTY ARMORED FOOT SOLDIERS wearing bronze helmets and
breastplates. The soldiers attack the caravan, slashing and slicing the
Bedouin guards. Their commander, SARGON, his helmet topped with a
magnificent plume, rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of
his sword cuts the head off ANOTHER BEDOUIN GUARD. Marlak reaches
through the bars, grabs the fallen Bedouin’s sword and hacks off the
lock on the door of the slave wagon. The door flies open and the slaves
tumble, jump and stumble out onto the ground. Zed and Oh look around,
gawking at the massacre taking place. Then Zed sees Marlak, sword in
hand, looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: Take the slaves! Marlak starts for Zed but
two soldiers ride up and throw a heavy restraining net over him. Zed
grabs oh and takes off running over the nearest sand dune. Sargon
watches them flee.</p>
<p><strong>a soldier</strong>: Sir, shall I pursue them?</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: No. Let the desert have them. They won’t get
far.</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: Tend to the slaves. We leave for Sodom
before daybreak.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>30 zed and oh</strong>: They lie hidden behind a sandy ridge
watching from a short distance.</p>
<p>****: I wonder who they are. Their hats are really great, aren’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Their hats? I’m sorry, but when that one guy cut
the other guy’s head off, my first thought wasn’t, “Gee, what a great
hat.”</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: It wasn’t my very first thought, but I’d be
lying if I said it wasn’t up there.</p>
<p>****: Now we just need to figure out a way to rescue Maya and
Eema.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: How are we going to rescue anybody? They’re
killers!</p>
<p>****: Patience, my friend. Even killers have to sleep sometime. He
keeps a sharp, wakeful eye on the enemy camp.</p>
<p><strong>31 the morning sun 31</strong>: Zed and Oh fast asleep on the
ridge. They slowly wake up.</p>
<p>****: Well, that was refreshing. How’d you sleep?</p>
<p>****: Not that well. I think I was over- tired. Then Zed suddenly
remembers Maya. He looks and sees that the soldiers and slaves are long
gone.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Shit! He leaps to his feet, looks around
desperately, and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every
direction.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Now where do we go? Zed sniffs the air, puts his
ear to the ground, and tastes the sand.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>32 zed and oh 32</strong>: trudging across the desert in the
blistering heat, growing weaker, stumbling and falling.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Why do I listen to you? Now we’re going to
starve to death or die of thirst.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Will you stop being so negative? I got your
back, man. Who saved you from those lions when you were a baby? They
were going to pounce, had you surrounded. Took the mama lion– BAM!–
kneed her right in the face. Papa lion comes flying at me– BAM!– dropped
an elbow, knocked his ass out.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You know, I’ve asked people about that and no
one else seems to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah, because nobody else was there. You’re
lucky I was walking by.</p>
<p>****: Okay, it’s possible I dreamed that– but who practically raised
you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons? Not a dignified
death.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: He was a small man. Oh collapses face down in
the sand. Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry
jackals, vultures and hyenas.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We’ve got to keep moving. I’ve got you, buddy–
just like always. He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Hey, Dad? We making a burnt offering?</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Yes, Isaac. As God has commanded me.</p>
<p>****: I don’t see the sheep.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: The Lord will provide the sheep. Abraham
takes a cord and starts tying Isaac’s hands together.</p>
<p>****: Uh– is this like a magic trick? Without another word Abraham
takes strong hold of Isaac and lifts him up onto the firewood. ISAAC
Okay, if this is because I didn’t clean up my tent, you can stop now. I
get it. Then Abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his
robe. ISAAC</p>
<p>****: All right, this isn’t funny anymore! Abraham raises the knife.
ISAAC I’m telling mom! The knife flashes in the sun as it descends
toward the boy.</p>
<p><strong>stop!</strong>: Abraham and Isaac both turn to see Zed and Oh
step out from behind the rocks. Their clothes are tattered and they are
burnt raw by the sun. ZED What are you doing to that kid?</p>
<p>****: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What do you mean, nothing? You were just going
to kill him!</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: No, I was going to sacrifice him. There’s a
difference.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Not to him, I’m guessing. Isaac nods
gratefully.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: By what right do you interfere? Art thou an
angel of the Lord?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Verily, thou wast sent to stay my hand by
the Eternal one, blessed be He.</p>
<p>****: Whatever you just said. Oh helps Isaac off the altar stone and
unties him.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: He’s nuts! I’m telling you– he’s totally lost
it.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: I am Abraham, son of Terah of the house of
Nahor.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I am Zed and this is Oh, sons of– people you
wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: The tents of my kinsmen lie just beyond.
There will you find all that you desire. Come.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: My brothers, let us give thanks unto God
for staying my hand on the mountain this day.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Best dad in all the land, everyone!</p>
<p>****: Praise be to God, hallowed be His name.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: And for the bounty which He hath bestowed
unto us.</p>
<p><strong>the kinsmen</strong>: He hath increased our wealth and
blessed us with His loving kindness. Zed and Oh mutter along, trying to
fit in.</p>
<p><strong>zed and oh</strong>: –mumble mumble mumble loving kindness.
Abraham looks at them.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Friends, whence comest thou? Zed and Oh
look at each other blankly.</p>
<p>****: He wants to know where you’re from.</p>
<p>****: Thou comest not from the cities of the plain? From Sodom or
Gomorrah? Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the
destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been there. But I’ve
heard of them.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Are they nice?</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: The Lord has cursed them for their
abomination.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: i didn’t know that. What kind of abomination
are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: They bow down before false Gods and worship
graven images.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Abominable.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: The men of the city are weak and soft, fat
with rich food, intoxicated by strong drink.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Really. Tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Their women are whores; their shameless
lust knows no bounds. They flaunt their flesh without shame and any man
may have knowledge of them.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: And where exactly are those cities?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We just want to know so we can avoid them.</p>
<p>****: Walk not the path of Sodom! For surely will the Lord send his
holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within, to smite them
and all their seed for their iniquity.</p>
<p>****: When do you think all this smiting is going to go down? We may
have some friends there.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Accompany me. Abraham sweeps out of the
tent. Zed and Oh jump to their feet and follow. Isaac tags along.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Abraham, I’m a little worried about the city
being destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Their fate is sealed. But for my faith and
devotion, the self-same God has given unto me the whole of this land,
from the Jordan to the Negev, from the river of Egypt to the great
Euphrates. This did He grant to me and my seed. He raises his arms and
spreads them wide.</p>
<p>****: This is all your land?</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: For eternity.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, God just forgot to tell anyone else. we’re having a war
with someone like every five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: I and my kinsmen have vanquished our
enemies by the mighty hand of the Lord, praised be He. Zed and Oh fake
their way through a ritual response.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: His name is praise and love his whole
graciousness–</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: –of his wealthy bounty. Abraham gets a strange
faraway look in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Therefore, to signify my Covenant with the
One True God, on this night will I circumcise the flesh of my foreskin,
and of you and every male who dwells hereby.</p>
<p><strong>zed oh</strong>: Excuse me? I’m not clear–</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Here we go again–</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: we will grasp the foreskins of our penises
and cut therefrom the extra flesh.</p>
<p>****: I’m not sure I have any extra.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Couldn’t we could just get our ears pierced?</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Okay, what did I tell you– nuts?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You know, Abe, it’s late, and we’ve all had a
lot to drink, and I know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good
idea now, but you may just want to sleep on it. we could always cut ’em
off in the morning, but if we do it now, there’s just no putting it back
on later.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: No. So it shall be written, so it shall be
done. Get my big knife. Zed and Oh both reflexively cover their
crotches.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You have any idea where we’re going?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: To the city. I have to find Maya.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: The city! He said God’s going to smite them with
holy fire!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: And you’re going to listen to him? You think
he’s more chosen than me?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: He seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes, and he also wanted to give his dick a
little trim.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, wait up! Zed and Oh turn to see Isaac
running towards them.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You don’t even know where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You’re going to Sodom, right?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No. Your dad specifically said Sodom and
Gomorrah were evil.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Yeah, whatever. If I show you how to get
there, will you buy me a bottle of wine?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No! I told you, that’s not where we’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Fine. Then we’ll just stand here.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Fine. They stand there for less than a beat.
ZED Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom. Isaac takes a couple of steps to
the top of a rise and points off in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent
city of Sodom set atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I knew it was right around here.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Me and my friends sneak in on the weekends.
We hang around, pick up on the babes, drink some wine, get wasted on
killer hash–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You shouldn’t be smoking either.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Thanks, Grandpa, but I’ve been smoking for
four harvests, so I think I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Gee, they’re not open. We should probably come
back later.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You just have to knock. They always let me
in. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Me? Why do I have to knock? What if we’re waking
somebody up? Let’s just get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Where? Back to the penis-cutter? Besides, Eema
and Maya might be in there. You want to get them out before the city’s
destroyed, don’t you? Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts
banging on the door.</p>
<p>****: Hey! Anybody there? Hello? Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off
their feet from behind and slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries.
Isaac quickly runs away.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Halt! Isaac stops a safe distance away and
turns back to taunt the guards.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: You gonna make me? You and what army?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Get help! Tell your father!</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him. The
sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner of the city
gates.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: What’s this now?</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: They were banging on the gate. Hebrews, from
the look of them.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We’re not really Hebrews– The guard smacks him
in the mouth. ZED Okay. Lesson learned. No talking.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Should we wake the Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: You don’t want to do that. He gets
pretty mean when you wake him.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Meaner than this? The sentry grabs Oh’s nipple
and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly. The guards freeze at the sound of his
scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.</p>
<p><strong>there!</strong>: Zed and Oh exchange worried looks. Then the
door flies open and the SERGEANT, a huge, angry, sadistic rhino of a
man, fills the door frame. SERGEANT Who the hell screamed? They all
point at Oh. SERGEANT I thought it was a woman. He lumbers over and gets
his face very close to Oh’s. SERGEANT You don’t look like a woman, but
maybe you want to kiss me anyway. Is that right? You want to kiss me? Oh
turns away from his foul breath. The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and
practically lifts him off the ground. SERGEANT By morning you’ll be
sorry you were born.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Don’t have to wait ’til morning.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey! Why don’t you pick on someone your own
size? The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed. ZED Which would be
difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually
are your size– He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Get my big stick. I’ll deal with the fat
one first.</p>
<p>****: Relatively fat one. I wouldn’t be talking about fat, if I were
you. Another blow from the sergeant. ZED Right. Enough said. The
sergeant rips open Zed’s shirt exposing his back, then steps up behind
Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a lethal-looking bat studded
with sharp spikes.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Welcome to Sodom. As he takes a big
backswing, Zed and Oh shut their eyes and prepare for the worst.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stop! Zed and Oh turn to see Cain at the
door, dressed like the other guards in breastplate and helmet.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Wait! I know these guys!</p>
<p><strong>zed and oh</strong>: Cain?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Brothers!! He embraces them. They look
confused and doubtful, but relieved.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: You know, you guys are lucky that sergeant is
a friend of mine. I let him sodomize me once right after I got here and
he’s been real nice to me ever since.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, thanks for saving us. What are you going to do to us now?
Cain stops and looks at them.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: wait a second. Do I detect a tone here?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: All right, honestly? You did sell us into
slavery.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge much? That was
like a fortnight ago.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That was way less than a fortnight. Half a
fortnight, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Give me a break! I was dealing with the death
of a close family member and I needed some space. But now I realize that
you guys are like my brothers. And it’s so rare to find a brother that
you love. Right? He embraces them.</p>
<p>****: Right.</p>
<p>****: Now, you guys hungry? Watch this. Cain walks up to a food
vendor’s stall and stares menacingly at the VENDOR. He raises his fist.
The vendor cowers.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Check out that woman across the street! She’s
looking at us. The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a
banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: We are so in! She’s eye-knowing us like
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: You’re gonna love Sodom. Trust me. It’s crazy.
This morning, I almost got a handie behind that pita stand.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Well, I kind of have a girlfriend– not a
girlfriend, yet, but a girl I like, so I shouldn’t–</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays in Sodom. He
takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT. The merchant just
bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut. CAIN You know, if you guys
are staying you should join the guards. The pay’s not great, but there’s
tons of perks. I’m telling you, it’s the only way to go. Cain grabs a
piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it in his mouth. The child
starts crying, Cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Come on, I’ll introduce you to the
captain.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: This is great! How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You look good, but I think my hat’s too big.
They notice an OFFICER staring at them. OH Do you happen to know where I
could get a smaller hat? The officer pops him on the head with a
truncheon.</p>
<p>****: Line up! Zed and Oh hustle into line, orders are shouted and
the troop marches off.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: So is this it? We just walk around?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Pretty much. We just look for troublemakers
and kick the living shit out of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What kind of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: If we see a thief or a pickpocket, we just
slap him around– maybe cut off a finger or an ear, or the tip of his
nose, lower lip– anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid
motion– then we take our share of the loot and let him go. Mostly what
we worry about are activist types, rabble rousers, getting people all
riled up against the King or the Temple Priests. That’s death for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Pretty harsh, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Harsh times, brother. We’re in the middle of a
famine. People are starving. If we don’t get some rain soon, it could
get ugly. Then we’ll get to start kicking ass big time. He stops to flog
a BEGGAR with his hand out. CAIN Beat it, you filthy beggar!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You can’t blame people for being hungry.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Yeah, well, just remember, it’s the palace
that pays you, not the people.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Did you see that girl? I think she liked me!
She looked right at me.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Gee, I wonder why? The royal guard takes his
foot off Zed’s neck and they all get back to their feet.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Who was she?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: The Princess Inanna. She’s totally hot, but
don’t even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Because she’s royalty and you’re scum? The
entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal
entourage.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Where’s everybody going?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: To the temple. Let’s go. You have to see
this.</p>
<p>****: Will she be there?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Everybody will be there.</p>
<p><strong>zed and oh</strong>: stare at the spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>44 the royal pavilion 44</strong>: The Princess Inanna takes
her seat near the KING, the QUEEN, the MINISTERS and other NOBLES. Maya
stands behind the Princess and continues fanning her. Zed spots the
Princess on the pavilion.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey, there she is! He starts edging toward the
royal pavilion.</p>
<p><strong>45 the pavilion</strong>: Under a broad awning, the King and
Queen snack from a table covered with platters of exotic fruits and
sweetmeats. The King, an imposing man with Shakespearean gravity, wipes
his mouth and glances at the Princess Inanna.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: The Princess isn’t eating?</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: I find it hard to eat when so many are
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Your concern is enviable.</p>
<p>****: And besides, I’m so fat. The Queen, 40’s, still beautiful,
reacts.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: You’re not fat–</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Yes, I am, mother! Those new linen pants you
got me from Egypt make my ass look just huge.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Well, you can’t keep starving yourself.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Why not? Everybody else is starving– present
company excluded.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Careful, Princess. You may be my
step-daughter, but these are dangerous times and those are dangerous
words. I weep for the suffering of my people, but the spirit of
rebellion is alive in the city and if necessary I will crush it with
every means at my disposal.</p>
<p>****: For the good of the people.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: For the good of everyone who enjoys the favor
of the throne.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Whatever. I’m just so incredibly bored.</p>
<p><strong>46 the temple doors 46</strong>: The fanfare climaxes as the
great temple doors slowly open and the HIGH PRIEST emerges followed by a
retinue of PRIESTESSES and a dozen VESTAL VIRGINS. They walk in solemn
silence to ritual positions around the altar. The High Priest is even
more elaborately costumed than the nobles, ridiculously so, standing
very tall on high platform shoes, with heavy eye makeup, his hair and
beard even oilier than the others. He turns to the altar, raises his
hands to the heavens and begins his invocation.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: O El, lord of Heaven and Earth; Baal,
the Sublime; Shapash, goddess of the sun; Hadad, the storm god,
over-ruling son of Dagon, the bountiful, god of grain, our earthly
sustenance–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: He makes his way to a position just below the
royal pavilion and stares up at the Princess Inanna. She sees him
looking at her but pretends not to notice.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Isn’t that the idiot who was standing up in
the street? Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming. The High Priest
continues.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: We come before you in humble
supplication, invoking your blessing, the sweet rain which waters our
fields, enriches the harvest, fills our storehouses, makes mighty the
house of Ish-ka-bi- baal and the city of Sodom– The King nods
graciously. HIGH PRIEST –and feeds us, your children, with the bounty of
your grace.</p>
<p><strong>princess inanna</strong>: She glances at Zed again, but this
time a slight smile crosses her lips. Zed grins back at her. The
Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and subtly points Zed
out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring at Zed, and starts fanning the
princess a little too vigorously.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Accept now this humble sacrifice to the
power and glory of your magnificence. He starts inspecting the Vestal
Virgins, beautiful young women in diaphanous, almost transparent white
gowns.</p>
<p><strong>zed and oh</strong>: have no idea what’s going on. Zed turns
to the GUY NEXT TO</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: He’s picking a virgin.</p>
<p>****: Oh yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>at the altar</strong>: the High Priest is moving down the
line of beautiful young maidens. He comes to one SLUTTY GIRL who seems
so obviously not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of
the line.</p>
<p><strong>zed and oh</strong>: watching curiously.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What do they want a virgin for?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: To throw into the fire.</p>
<p>****: Why?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Offering to the Gods. There’s a famine going
on. If we don’t make a good sacrifice, it won’t rain. No rain, no
harvest. No harvest, no food. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: It’s pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You throw the virgin in the fire so it’ll
rain?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Duh.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin
to me.</p>
<p>****: These virgins– it’s always a girl, right?</p>
<p><strong>at the altar</strong>: A great cheer goes up as a girl is
chosen. She swoons as the priestesses slip off her vestment and two
priests escort her to the fiery mouth of the furnace.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: For the love of the Gods and the glory
of their Creation, the great dome of Heaven, the green growing Earth, we
commit this maiden to your Holy Fire. Another great cheer from the crowd
as they throw her into the fire.</p>
<p>****: This is just crazy. Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still
don’t recognize her.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: The Princess wishes to see you.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Her wish is my command.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Not you. Him.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Me? Cool. We’re kind of a package deal. Can he
come with?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: The three of us are inseparable. We’re like
brothers. Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an
artificial smile.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: The two of you follow me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’ll try to put in a good word for you. Cain
fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: This is Zaftig the Eunuch. You go with him. Oh
is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the opposite
direction.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Can’t I go with him?</p>
<p><strong>eunuch</strong>: Why? Is he your lover?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Hah! No? That would be weird.</p>
<p><strong>lovers–</strong>: The Eunuch just shrugs, apparently not that
weird to him. OH</p>
<p>****: So what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>eunuch</strong>: I serve the royal family– little of this,
little of that. I’ve been a palace eunuch since I was nine years
old.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: You’ve been living here since you were nine? I
should look into that. How do you get to be a eunuch?</p>
<p>****: They cut off your testicles.</p>
<p>****: What?! What’s up with all the genital mutilation?</p>
<p>****: Trust me, after a while you don’t even miss them.</p>
<p>****: No, I’d miss them– I’m sure. I hardly got to use them yet. The
Eunuch leads him down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>49 a sheep’s heart, liver and guts 49</strong>: land with a
wet splat on a polished marble table.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Six sacrifices in the last ten days and still
no rain. What do the entrails predict?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Well, the liver is streaked with gray–
that’s not a favorable sign– but the heart looks good. See how nice and
red it is here. That’s always a good omen.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Usually it means that the sheep took
very good care of itself, probably sticking to a high-fiber diet of
grass and hay.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: What does it mean for us?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Well, it could mean either a surprise
visit from a former friend or sweetheart– or that you’re going on a long
sea voyage! Wouldn’t that be fun?</p>
<p>****: How did you become High Priest?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Because I’m your brother?</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: Perhaps it’s time for a new High
Priest.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Perhaps it’s not time for a new High
Priest. Aaaahh! He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime
Minister, as if wielding the power of the Gods. Nothing happens. HIGH
PRIEST And let that be a warning to you. Next time, I will hurl a
lightning bolt at your face.</p>
<p>****: Or a fire-ball.</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: Majesty, there’s talk of revolution
in the streets. Grain and oil are scarce, prices are high, starving
peasants are pouring into the city looking for food–</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Poverty has a bitter taste, but it’s the
flavor they were born to. It’s the will of the Gods. The Queen and
Princess Inanna are lounging on cushioned divans, listening.</p>
<p>****: Can the Gods really be so cruel?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: I don’t think that’s cruel. It’s just
practical. If everybody was rich, who’d wait on us? Maya approaches and
whispers something to the Princess.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Good. See that he’s bathed and dressed, then
bring him to me. Maya frowns and exits. INANNA This should be
amusing.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What do you think, ponytail or no ponytail? You
know what?</p>
<p>****: I wouldn’t know.- I’m just a guard because my “brother” didn’t
pull any strings with his friends in the royal court.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Look, first of all, we’re not actually
brothers—</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Just like Abel. I oughta just bash your head
in–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey! You didn’t let me finish. As soon as I get
in there I’m going to talk to somebody and get you invited, okay?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, sure. Have a nice orgy. Cain pulls open the big doors and
Zed steps through the portal. Cain tries to steal peeks inside as the
heavy doors slam shut.</p>
<p><strong>51 zed’s pov 51</strong>: A full-scale ORGY is going on in a
magnificent hall. As Maya leads him into the room, Zed pulls his hair
out of the ponytail.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Feels like a hair-down kinda scene, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p>****: Be sure to try the fruit. Zed looks at her and finally
recognizes her.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Maya?! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I had no choice. I’m a slave, remember?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I was going to rescue you! Really! In fact, we
came here to find you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Wait here until you’re sent for.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: This wasn’t my idea, you know.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Of course not. You were just chosen again.
Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking
about someone beside yourself. She walks off before he can answer. Zed
shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS walking past a row
of “LIVING STATUES,” semi-nude men and women on pedestals covered head
to toe in gold body paint, frozen in heroic postures that show off their
beautiful bodies. Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude “GODDESS”,
then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess slaps his
hand, then resumes her pose.</p>
<p><strong>goddess</strong>: watch it, jerk!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey! You’re a real girl! That is so cool.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I’m not supposed to talk. I’m a statue.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yeah, you look so– gold. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: How’s it going? I just had my whole body painted
by a fat guy with no balls, and believe me, he was very thorough, if you
know what I mean. How’s it going with you?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Not bad. Had a little rub and a scrub, now I’m
up for some grub.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: That sounds nice– for you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey! You’ll never guess who’s here- - Maya!
She’s working here– and she looks great! But she’s kinda mad at me. Oh
scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed’s sister Eema, his
crush, come into the room carrying a tray of food.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: There’s Eema! Eema has been beautifully groomed
and is now dressed as a household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy
OFFICERS who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to
pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: Stand still, wench! I want to see what’s
under that skirt. As he starts to lift her hem, she drops the whole tray
of food on him. His cohorts laugh.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: I’m sorry! It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: That was no accident! Sargon grabs her and
raises his hand to hit her. Zed steps in quickly.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You! Slave girl!</p>
<p>****: I told you to fetch me more wine! Apologize to this officer—
now!</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Now go– fetch! Wait by that– skinny statue.
I’ll deal with you later. As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and
shrugs. ZED Slaves– what are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: Try using a hot poker. That they
understand.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep that in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: We were sold to the palace. But I won’t serve
these people! I’d rather die!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Keep that up and you will.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: What are you doing here? Have you joined
them?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I haven’t joined anything. Does this look like
fun? They both look accusingly at Zed.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, I know what you’re thinking, but I’m just
checking it out. We kept hearing that this place was so evil, but now
that I look around I’m thinking maybe it’s not all bad. There’s a lot to
learn here.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: What? Like human sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No! Like the wheel, for instance! That’s pretty
awesome– the way it just goes around in a circle. And farming! And
metal– writing, money, pottery– hot baths. Come on! Back in the village
we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Look, I think I’ve been chosen to do something
great with my life–</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Here we go again–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: –and I don’t think it’s hunting wild pigs and
weaving baskets. Maya returns for Zed.</p>
<p>****: She wants to see you– now.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I hope you don’t think I’m interested in
her.</p>
<p>****: Why would I think that? Just because you couldn’t take your
eyes off her–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’m just using her, Maya! It’s part of my plan.
I’m going to get you all out of here as soon as I can.</p>
<p>****: What’s your plan?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: It’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Forget it. Maya sees A GUARD watching them and
reverts to her slave attitude. MAYA The Princess awaits you.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: And I await her. You two await me. Stay out of
trouble. I’ll be back. He exits with Maya.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: He has no idea what he’s doing, does he?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I don’t know. So much has happened. Sometimes I
think– She walks away. OH I love you.</p>
<p><strong>52 the high priest 52</strong>: Lounging on a divan
surrounded by YOUNG MEN. Oh walks by still painted gold.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: You there! Golden boy! Rub me with oil.
The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets his rich
outer robe fall to the floor. His chest, back and shoulders are
incredibly hairy.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I’d rather not, if you don’t mind. I’m not
really a slave. I’m a guard.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Then maybe you’d rather I speak to your
commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life. Or
perhaps I whip you myself? How would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Are those my choices?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: I’d say so. The High Priest lies back
down. Oh looks around, finds a pitcher filled with precious oil and
dribbles some on the High Priest’s hairy chest.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: That enough?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: No! More oil! Much more, you insolent
dolt! Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders. HIGH
PRIEST That’s good. Now rub it in.</p>
<p>****: With my hands?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Do it! Oh grimaces and starts gingerly
massaging the oil into his hairy chest and shoulders. HIGH PRIEST Mmmmm,
I love it. The sweet scent of precious oil. The oily– oiliness. Eema
walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging the High Priest.
She gasps.</p>
<p>****: Eema! This isn’t what you think.</p>
<p>****: No, it’s fine. I understand. This really explains a lot about
you that I didn’t get before.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: No, really! I’m just– rubbing oil on this man.
She exits.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Mnum imam. I have an idea. Why don’t we
go back to my place and see what’s under all that paint?</p>
<p>****: Ughh.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>maya–</strong>: She leaves him. A haze of heavily scented
incense hangs in the air.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Come to me. Zed turns and sees the Princess
standing on the terrace.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Beautiful, isn’t it? You can see Gomorrah
just over the hill.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I didn’t know it was so close.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: They’re called the “twin cities.”</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Looks pretty from up here, but some people
think God is going to wipe them out because they’re so evil.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: And what do you think? Am I evil?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I don’t really know you. But you don’t look
evil.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Do you find me attractive?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, yeah. I think you’re– incredible.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: I have body issues.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, you’re perfect. Your face, your hair– Your
eyes are like the sea.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: My eyes are brown.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, it’s kinda dark. I took a shot. I know
they’re big, though– and wet– She pulls him close. ZED Can I ask you one
thing? What would a girl like you want with a guy like me?</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: I don’t know. I just find you– interesting.
They say it’s the will of the gods that some men should suffer while
others rule– that we’re all just victims of our fate. And I believed
that until this morning when I saw you standing up, alone, in the
square. And I said to myself, finally here’s one man who refuses to bow
down to anything–</p>
<p><strong>uh–</strong>: Yeah. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Yes, finally a man who has the courage to
question the order of things— a man chosen by the Gods to do something
great.</p>
<p>****: That’s exactly what I’ve been thinking! You wouldn’t believe
the things that have been happening to me lately. I just didn’t know
why.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: I know why. To bring you here– to this
place– to me.</p>
<p>****: I couldn’t agree more. I’m trying to agree more, but I can’t.
That’s how much I agree.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Come. She takes his hand and leads him away.
A SHADOWY FIGURE watches them from behind a curtain.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: My life is devoted to the service of
the Gods and the good of the people. I take nothing for myself. He has a
huge gold ring set with precious gems on every finger, and a gold tiara
on his head studded with rubies and emeralds.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: That’s so– unselfish of you.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Yes, it is. It’s just so– lonely.
Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being.</p>
<p>****: Here’s a riddle: what has two thumbs and wants another oil
rub?</p>
<p>****: This-guy. Ohquickly changes the subject.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: So where does that hall lead to?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Come, I’ll show you. He takes Oh’s arm
and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors
covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols. HIGH PRIEST
Behind those doors is the Holy of Holies– the earthly domain of the</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Wow. So who cleans it?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: it needs no cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: No, of course not. Kind of makes you wonder
though– the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they
finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: I assume they finished it, then the
Gods descended.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Yeah, that’s probably it. So you’re saying we
can’t go in?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: I just told you! To enter is instant
death! Only I can go in and only once a year after very elaborate
purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings.</p>
<p>****: Right, right, right.</p>
<p>****: What if we just open the doors and stick our heads in?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Fine! Enough! I’m sorry I brought it
up. Let’s go. Move. Move. He shoos him down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: I want you to enter the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes! Finally. Now you’re talking! Should I
enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom? Does the Holy
of Holies like to be entered from behind or–?</p>
<p>****: That’s the Holy of Holies– you have to go in there and talk to
the Gods.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: The Gods are in there?</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: So they say, but the only one who ever goes
in is the High Priest. They say it’s instant death for anyone else to
enter.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Then why am I going in?</p>
<p>****: Because you were chosen? If the Gods wanted you dead they would
have killed you already.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: This is what you’ve been chosen for! To
speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city. Then come
back out and tell me what it’s like inside.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Right– right. Then again, if the rules say–</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Do you always follow the rules?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What is it with chicks always wanting guys to
break the rules? You-all have this bad boy complex—- She kisses him
fiercely on the lips.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: Do this for me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’m going in. He enters the Holy of Holies. A
FIGURE darts between the columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of
moonlight reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Thank you, O– Merciful ones, for– not like–
killing me, and letting me receive the, uh, blessing of your holy–
godliness. He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine
response. Nothing comes.</p>
<p>****: Okay, I don’t know the right words– so I’m just going to say
what I have to say– if that’s all right. I know I haven’t always done
the right thing. Eating the fruit was bad, I know that– and the Cain
thing– and I have done somethings with women– I do love the ladies–
well, you probably know all that because you’re watching everything– Do
you really watch everything? That’s got to be a little disgusting
sometimes– but probably pretty hot, too–</p>
<p>****: Not that you would get off on any of it– okay, I’m getting off
the subject. Anyways, the word is you’ve been considering destroying
this place. So I’m asking you not to– as a personal favor.</p>
<p>****: Feel free to jump in anytime. I could use a little guidance
here. Still no response. He rolls over onto his back. ZED Look, I know
you think this place is evil and it kinda is– I see that– but that’s not
everybody. There are a lot of good people, too. So what if there were,
like, fifty really good people? Would you still destroy the city?</p>
<p>****: Okay, you’re right, that may be a reach. How about twenty? I
could probably get you twenty extremely good people if I really looked
around.</p>
<p>****: How about five? Five awesome people– including myself. I
personally know at least five people worth saving. Does that sound
good?</p>
<p>****: Hello? A little help? Am I getting warm here? Okay, is it me?
Are you punishing me for stuff I did? Or setting me up for what I need
to do. Or both! Or neither?</p>
<p>****: Could you give me some kind of a sign– please– anything? Zed
listens but hears only a profound silence. Then a revelation. He sits up
on the floor. ZED Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The silence? Is that it?
It is, isn’t it! Just this really silent– silence.</p>
<p>****: You’re not going to tell me what to do; it’s up to me to decide
what’s right and what’s wrong– right? Is that it? You’re not going to
speak to me– you’re going to speak through me? If that’s right, don’t
say anything. Okay, I read you loud and clear. Thank you. Oh, and if
things don’t work out with Maya would it be okay with you if me and the
Princess had a little “carnal knowledge”? Not in an evil way or
anything– Okay! You’re right, probably not a good idea. Thank you. He
backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I was just looking for the bathroom.</p>
<p>****: I told him not to go in.</p>
<p>****: Seize them!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Seize him! The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up
and takes hold of Zed.</p>
<p>****: Should’ve invited me to the party.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I wish I was upside down. Looks fun. Oh won’t
talk to him. ZED So this is it? We’re not friends anymore? After all
I’ve done for you?</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: What have you done for me? I’ve been attacked by
a cougar, I’ve fallen down a mountain, I almost had the tip of my thingy
cut off, I’ve been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now I’m
hanging upside down in a dungeon. And I have to pee real bad. All
because of you. You call yourself a friend? Name one good thing you’ve
done for me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’ve helped you come out of your shell.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I really have to pee–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Listen, I know I’m not perfect, and I may have
made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand– I’m a chosen. That’s
a lot of responsibility – you can’t even imagine.</p>
<p>****: The only one who thinks you’re chosen is you, so shut up
already!</p>
<p>****: Okay, be mad, but I’m going to get us out of here, if it’s the
last thing I do. Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no
avail. ZED That was just my first idea– and I’m also accepting
ideas.</p>
<p>****: Guard! I have to pee! Now! Seriously! Oh, no–</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: For the crimes of blasphemy–</p>
<p><strong>sodomy–</strong>: And the murder of my brother Abel–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh, come on!</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Shut up! For these and other crimes they may
not actually have done yet but we’re pretty sure they were thinking
about, the prisoners will be stoned to death. The crowd roars as GUARDS
stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks
and the people rush to grab stones to throw. Zed and Oh instinctively
move closer to each other.</p>
<p><strong>palace balcony</strong>: The King, Queen, High Priest and
Royal Ministers observe the stoning from their vantage point above the
square. Princess Inanna refuses to look.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Observe, my dear. It seems the least you could
do, since it was you who lured him to his death. She reluctantly turns
and looks at Zed.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: I didn’t intend for this to happen.</p>
<p><strong>the square</strong>: The people move in and surround the
platform on all sides, baseball-size rocks in their hands.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Anything to say before the sentence is carried
out?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I just want to say this is really messed
up–</p>
<p><strong>stone them!</strong>: The people fling their rocks with all
their might. Zed and Oh duck. The rocks fly over their heads and hit
people in the crowd on the opposite sides, several bystanders taking
painful hits in the head, some falling down unconscious. Cain notes the
impracticality of having people throw rocks from all directions. CAIN
Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Can I make a suggestion?</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why don’t you just pick one person to throw?
The crowd thinks that’s not a bad idea and murmurs agreement. ZED In
fact, don’t you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person
who stones us? Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is
eminently fair.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: their hands and waving Yes! Ooh, me! Pick me!
Me!</p>
<p><strong>on the balcony</strong>: The King grabs Sargon.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: What is that idiot doing?</p>
<p><strong>in the square</strong>: Zed spots a good candidate in the
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We pick him! Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily
muscled, eagerly waving his hand.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, next to him! He points at a BOY, about nine
years old and not very big.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: He’s just a kid!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: So? You got something against kids? Zed plays
the crowd which starts booing in disapproval. ZED This guy hates
kids!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Yeah! What’s he got against kids? Children
are the future! Give the kid a shot! The kid! The kid! On the balcony,
the King shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by the power of the mob. He
nods to Sargon who signals to Cain.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: All right! All right! We’ll try it. Kid! Grab
a rock. The boy picks up a good-size rock. Zed turns to Oh.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Good thinking, huh? They turn to face the boy,
ready to dodge when he throws. The boy winds up and fires a major league
fastball that smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers. ZED
Holy shit! That kid’s got an arm!</p>
<p>****: I think he hit me. The boy fires again. Oh spins and tries to
duck but takes the rock right on the head. OH Hey! There’s two of us!
The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Okay, everybody on this side now! On the count
of three! One– two–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Wait! I have a question for the King! The crowd
goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony. ZED Why
didn’t I die in the Holy of Holies? On the balcony, everyone is totally
stopped by his question. One by one they all look to the High Priest who
seems to be stumped. In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed
seizes the initiative. ZED I entered the Holy of Holies and, lo, I did
not die! Why? Because I am chosen by the Gods!</p>
<p><strong>people in the crowd</strong>: He is chosen! He is the Chosen
One. The Chosen One! Zed gives Oh a look: “See? I told you.”</p>
<p><strong>the crowd</strong>: Spare the Chosen One! Spare the Chosen
One! Spare the Chosen One!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: And his friend! Don’t forget his friend! On the
balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer with the High
Priest.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Could it be? Is he truly chosen?</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: I don’t– I suppose it’s possible- I’d
have to examine some new</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Imbecile!</p>
<p><strong>prime minister</strong>: Majesty, with respect, whether he’s
chosen or not is no longer the issue. To kill him now, given the public
mood, could inflame the situation enough to prompt a radical “regime
change,” if you take my meaning. The King looks grimly at his ministers,
all of whom have lean and hungry looks. Princess Inanna smiles
contemptuously at him.</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: By order of the King, the sentence has been
commuted. The crowd cheers. Zed and Oh exchange hopeful looks.</p>
<p>****: Can’t we just stone them a little?</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: It is the judgement of our most merciful
King that the prisoners are to be enslaved to toil at hard labor until
they die of exhaustion or starvation.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Okay, you think that actually makes anybody work
harder? It just makes them resent you. Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Can I just ask when lunch is? The whip lashes
out again. Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace.</p>
<p><strong>64 the brick yard 64</strong>: Marlak and Enmebaragesi are
stacking bricks when zed approaches.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey! Boys! Long time no see. They glance up,
but ignore him. ZED Don’t tell me you’re still mad about Maya. That’s so
over. I have a thing going with the princess now– well, almost had a
thing. I’m a slave now– just like you.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: No. You’re not just like me.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay. We do have our differences– like about a
cup and half of brain tissue– but that doesn’t mean we can’t work
together. Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Take those bricks to the top. The masons
are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You know, I’d like to, but I did something to
my neck– I must’ve slept on it funny– those dungeon pillows are like
rocks– well, they are rocks– so I should probably take it easy or I’ll
be no damn good for work tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: I said move!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay! But I should tell you, this isn’t really
my area. I’m just on a break from the mud department– The Guard draws
his short sword and raises it over Zed.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: One more word and you die–</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, okay. I’m going.</p>
<p>****: Okay, boys, on the count of three. One– two– three! Marlak and
Enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes, but Zed makes no effort to pull.
They glare at him. ZED Learned that from Maya. Good trick, huh? Okay,
together this time. Go!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: How high you guys think we’re going with
this?</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer one</strong>: Up to Heaven, I guess. That’s how
tall they usually build ’em.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That’s ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer two</strong>: We worked on the Tower of Babel. Now
that was a ziggurat.</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer one</strong>: Incredible erection. Zed looks down
at his crotch.</p>
<p>****: That’s nothing. You should see it when I’m excited.</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer one</strong>: The tower.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh, right, the tower. Incredible erection.</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer one</strong>: See, the Egyptians are working on an
entirely different concept. Four sides, slanting walls, pointy top.</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer two</strong>: Like a pyramid?</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer one</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>bricklayer two</strong>: Wow. Far out. Yet timeless in a way.
A SLAVE CHILD approaches with a water bucket.</p>
<p><strong>slave child</strong>: Want some water? As the child offers
him the ladle, Zed recognizes her.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You’re from the village, aren’t you? The child
nods. ZED I bet you wish you were back there right now, don’t you. The
child nods again. ZED Well, don’t give up. You’re going to get home
someday. Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Who’s going to take her there? The Chosen
One? Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed’s face. Zed just lies there and
takes it, feeling like he’s failed everyone. Then he hears the beating
of drums and trumpet fanfares coming from the temple square below.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get in line! Now! Move!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Where’re we going?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: To watch the sacrifice. The King demands
it.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Is that compulsory? Because I saw one when I
first got here and it made me a little sick– The guard’s whip catches
him across the back. OH Ow! Why don’t you try using your words for a
change?</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: At your service, my lady. Anytime,
anywhere.</p>
<p>****: There’s a depraved thought. You’re so delightfully low.
Absolute filth.</p>
<p>****: Thank you, your majesty. He touches his tongue to the tip of
his nose and waggles his eyebrows. The King arrives with Sargon to loud
booing from the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Are they booing me? How dare they!</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Your Highness, with all due respect, those
were “Woos.” They love you. They were “wooing” you. The King looks
doubtfully at the hostile crowd.</p>
<p><strong>sargon</strong>: All is in readiness, Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: What now? More virgins to sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Yes, two, followers of the Chosen One,
discovered by this loyal soldier. Cain bows to the King.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Just doing my duty.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: And one more to demonstrate our own faith and
charity. The King stands and makes a proclamation loud enough for
everyone to hear. KING In supplication to the Gods, for the love of the
People, we offer a humble sacrifice to the sacred temple fire– our own
step- daughter, the Princess Inanna! The crowd gasps. KING For the good
of the people.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: You wouldn’t dare!</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Wouldn’t I? If you like, I could arrange for
you to join her. The Queen slowly sits back down. KING How long did you
think I’d tolerate your insolence? Burn her.- Sargon and Cain seize
Inanna, but she shrugs them off and rises with dignity.</p>
<p><strong>inanna</strong>: I’ll see you all in Hell.</p>
<p><strong>68 the great stone idol 68</strong>: The flames are starting
to build inside the idol’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: See the High Priest? I know him. Dear friend of
mine.</p>
<p><strong>the temple</strong>: Now the procession of SACRIFICIAL
VIRGINS is led out by the HIGH PRIESTESS. Maya and Eema are among them,
their hands tied. They look like they’ve been drugged. Oh spots Eema and
Maya among the virgins.</p>
<p>****: That’s Eema! And Maya! I know them!</p>
<p>****: I guess you know everybody, don’t you. Oh shoulders his way
right up to the barrier where a BIG GUARD stops him with a spear to his
neck.</p>
<p><strong>big guard</strong>: That’s far enough, slave. Oh stops right
there, frustrated and frightened.</p>
<p><strong>the temple</strong>: Inanna is led out last, now also having
been drugged.</p>
<p><strong>70 top of the ziggurat 70</strong>: Zed, Marlak and the
sharp-eyed Enmebaragesi look down, trying to see what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>enmebaragesi</strong>: They’re bringing out the women.</p>
<p>****: How are you seeing that far?</p>
<p><strong>enmebaragesi</strong>: I see your sister, Eema–</p>
<p>****: It’s Maya!</p>
<p><strong>71 the temple 71</strong>: The drums and trumpets kick up the
tempo and the High Priest starts leading the virgins to the idol’s fiery
mouth. Oh pushes against the barrier, restrained by the guard.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: We have to do something! Somebody has to stop
it.</p>
<p>****: We can’t let them do this! The slaves start to mutter. The
guards draw their swords and heft their spears, now on high alert.</p>
<p><strong>72 top of the ziggurat 72</strong>: Zed looks around
desperately, trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I have to get down there.</p>
<p>****: Over my dead body.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: All right. Without a moment’s hesitation,
Marlak grabs him and tosses him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams
all the way down.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Wow. Who saw that coming? Thanks, Marlak.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: Now what? Zed looks around quickly, grabs
the end of a long coiled rope attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak
the other end.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Lower me down. Without waiting for a response,
Zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: He’s descending rapidly, rappelling off the
side of the ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and
slow him down.</p>
<p>****: Any time now, Marlak! Marlak and Enmebaragesi watch his
descent, dumbly interested in what happens next. Zed sees he’s not
slowing down and tries to swing himself onto one of the upper levels of
the ziggurat. However, when he swings in, he hits a cart loaded with
bricks and bounces off painfully.</p>
<p><strong>the brick cart</strong>: The sudden jolt dislodges the wheel
chock that was holding the cart on the sloping ramp of the tower. The
cart starts to roll down the ramp, gathering speed as it careens toward
the edge.</p>
<p><strong>73 the high priest 73</strong>: He raises his staff and
invokes the Gods.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: We implore the great Gods of heaven to
show us a sign that we may honor your divine will and be worthy of your
blessing.</p>
<p><strong>74 the ziggurat 74</strong>: The brick cart explodes through
the scaffolding on the side of the ziggurat and sails into the air.</p>
<p><strong>the royal enclosure</strong>: Everybody turns at the sound of
the crash and looks up at the ziggurat.</p>
<p><strong>the brick pits</strong>: The NASTY GUARD who whipped Oh
earlier glances up and is instantly crushed by a ton of falling
bricks.</p>
<p><strong>the ziggurat</strong>: Zed is still descending as the broken
scaffolding starts to give way.</p>
<p><strong>temple square</strong>: The whole crowd watches in amazement
as the 250 foot scaffolding slowly collapses and crashes to the ground,
bringing tons of debris with it, sending up a great cloud of dust.</p>
<p><strong>the high priest</strong>: He looks shocked.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: He seizes the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: A sign! It’s a sign! The Chosen One comes! The
other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his excitement.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: The Chosen One! A sign from the Gods!</p>
<p><strong>the high priest</strong>: He doesn’t quite know how to
respond to the growing fervor of the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Yes! Well and truly, the Gods are with
us– The crowd drowns him out.</p>
<p><strong>75 the base of the ziggurat 75</strong>: A guard is standing
there staring at the rubble of the scaffolding as Zed comes screaming
down the side of the ziggurat and lands right on top of him. Zed quickly
strips the unconscious guard of his weapons, starts to run off, stops,
comes back and grabs the guard’s helmet, then takes off running to the
temple square.</p>
<p><strong>76 the altar 76</strong>: The High Priest is getting frantic
now.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Burn them! Now! He grabs Maya and
starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth of the idol and the raging
fire within. She struggles but is too drugged to put up much resistance.
He grabs the sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing
her. HIGH PRIEST</p>
<p>****: May the balm of this healing oil soothe your journey through
the sacred fire!</p>
<p>****: Don’t fight it! It’s the will of the Gods! Then, a voice from
above.</p>
<p>****: I don’t think so! Zed is standing atop the idol’s head,
brandishing a sword and shield.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: She sees him and starts to revive.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Zed!</p>
<p><strong>the high priest</strong>: looks up, unable to hear Zed over
the crowd noise.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p>****: I said, ‘I don’t think so!’</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Still not getting it. Zed rolls his
eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of
the idol. He jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the
fire, blocking the High Priest’s way.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I Said, ‘I don’t think so.’</p>
<p>****: You don’t think what?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Whatever that last thing you said was.</p>
<p>****: I forgot.</p>
<p>****: Guards!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: I know him, too. Oh springs into action,
attacking the big guard in front of him. The other slaves see that and
start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt.</p>
<p><strong>the crowd</strong>: Guards start moving to help their
comrades, but the spirit of insurrection takes hold of the crowd and
people start grappling with the guards. A PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS
comes double-timing into the square. Suddenly, A STOOPED OLD MAN throws
off his cloak and pulls a sword. It’s Abraham!</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: Death to the idolators! Abraham’s small
army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their weapons and attack the
reinforcements. The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands
there observing the growing chaos.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Just fucking nuts.</p>
<p><strong>77 marlak and enmebaragesi 77</strong>: They come running
into the battle swinging clubs, randomly bashing heads of soldiers and
innocent civilians alike. Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Tough guy, huh? You want a piece of me? Get
ready to have your head bashed in!</p>
<p><strong>78 the king 78</strong>: He starts to panic at the full-scale
revolt and rises nervously. His ministers surround him, he thinks to
protect him.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: I knew I could depend on your loyalty. The
ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in for the kill.
KING</p>
<p>****: Assholes. He falls to their flashing knives.</p>
<p><strong>79 the temple 79</strong>: Oh fights his way to the temple
stairs, runs up and confronts a PRIEST who is trying to drag Eema away.
He fights with very little skill but tremendous energy, finally
overwhelming the guard and grabbing Eema.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Hello, Eema.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: Oh? He stares at her full red lips and big
blue eyes.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Eema, you’re my woman! You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Really? It’s okay? He pulls her into an embrace
and kisses her hard on the mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh
sees a guard rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform,
accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.</p>
<p><strong>80 the high priest 80</strong>: While Zed is busy with the
guards, the High Priest pulls Maya toward the fire. Zed sees him,
finishes the last of the guards, and starts slowly moving toward the
High Priest who starts backing away until he sees Oh moving toward him
from the other side. He holds the helpless Maya close to the flames.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: Keep away!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>high priest</strong>: No! The Gods demand a sacrifice! And
you ruined it! He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Why don’t we just sacrifice something small– a
rabbit maybe. Or a duck. That’d be good, don’t you think?</p>
<p>****: No! A duck would not be good!</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Then how about this? The High Priest turns to
Oh. Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher. OH More oil?</p>
<p>****: Hot!</p>
<p><strong>temple square</strong>: Everyone goes silent, stunned by the
incredible turn of events. All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing
before them on the center stage of the temple.</p>
<p><strong>zed and oh</strong>: They look at each other. Someone has to
say something. Finally, Zed clears his throat.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I’m the, uh, Chosen One, I guess, and on behalf
of, well, the whole city, I want to thank the High Priest for his
incredible sacrifice. That was really something, wasn’t it? He starts
clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the people in the square
are applauding. At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed
in the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady rain
starts to fall. The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and
they all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as it
started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied muttering
begins. ZED People! Friends! Sodomites! Okay, that was a little
confusing, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: All hail the Chosen One! With that the crowd
explodes into rousing cheers. In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks
around and scowls.</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong>: What am I? Chopped liver? At the altar,
Maya, revived now, embraces Zed.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’re incredible, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you. Zed
and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people
as Inanna looks on.</p>
<p><strong>isaac</strong>: Hey, babe. Ever made it with a circumcised
guy? Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife. ISAAC</p>
<p>****: Is she with you? I did not realize that. Sorry. Marlak and Maya
cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse. Marlak looks at him for a long
moment then punches him hard on the shoulder.</p>
<p>****: You did good. Zed waits for more, but nothing comes.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well said, Marlak. You really have a way with
words. They clasp hands.</p>
<p><strong>marlak</strong>: We’ll tell stories about you around the
fire.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Not much to tell, is there? Just an average guy
who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire. No
big deal. Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one
is listening to him. Zed joins him. ZED Everybody ready?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, just about– I guess so. The Hebrews are going to lead us
to the sea and we can get boats from there. We can trade all this stuff
everybody gave us for the trip home.</p>
<p>****: I don’t think I should be the leader. Nobody’s listening to
me.</p>
<p><strong>eema</strong>: I’ll listen to you. Oh swells up with
pride.</p>
<p><strong>oh</strong>: Come back to the village sometime. Zed nods,
they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a tear, Oh breaks away and
whips the lead camel. OH Hee-ya! Come on. People are watching. The camel
looks at him and slowly lumbers off. Oh sighs gratefully and signals the
caravan to follow. As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing
there with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground beside
him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet. Maya joins him.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Where will you go now?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Might head down to Egypt. I hear it’s a
happening kinda place.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Are you going alone?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Not necessarily. You want to come?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: I’ll get my things. She gestures off and he
sees a small train of camels and horses loaded with a ton of her
personal possessions. MAYA The Princess gave me a few gifts when she
freed us.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Traveling light, huh? Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>****: To the west!</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: That’s west.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I knew that. Just wanted to see if you did. Zed
grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of sheep and goats,
tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the opposite direction. As THE LAST OF
THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something masculine about her build
and posture. Zed nods politely to her, but she averts her eyes and turns
away from him.</p>
<p><strong>cain</strong>: Peace— brother. zed does a double take at the
voice, shrugs, and walks off with Maya– as a torrential rain begins to
fall.</p>
