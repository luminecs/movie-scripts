<p><strong>meet john doe</strong>: Written by Robert Riskin</p>
<p><strong>the bulletin</strong>: “A free press for a free people.”</p>
<p><strong>the new bulletin</strong>: “A streamlined newspaper for a
streamlined era.”</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the
dead-wood. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can’t afford to
be without work right now, not even for a day. I’ve got a mother and two
kid sisters to . . .</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: More good luck telegrams.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, you know how it is, I, I’ve just got to
keep working. See?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Sorry, sister. I was sent down here to
clean house. I told yuh I can’t use your column any more. It’s lavender
and old lace!</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Send those other people in.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I get thirty
dollars a week. I’ll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I’ll do
anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: It isn’t the money. We’re after
circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge
hammers�start arguments.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out.
Oh, give me a chance, please.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: All right, come in, come in! Come in!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Don’t forget to get out your last column
before you pick up your check!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You’re a couple o’ sticks shy in your column,
Ann.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a
paper�and forty heads are chopped off!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Did you get it, too?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I’m sorry
darling . . . why don’t we tear the building down!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Before you do, Ann, perhaps you’d better finish
this column.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah. Lavender and old lace!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Wait, Joe�wait!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Wants fireworks, huh? Okay!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “Below is a letter which reached my desk this
morning. It’s a commentary on what we laughingly call the civilized
world. ‘Dear Miss Mitchell: Four years ago I was fired out of my job.
Since then I haven’t been able to get another one. At first I was sore
at the state administration because it’s on account of the slimy
politics here we have all this unemployment. But in looking around, it
seems the whole world’s going to pot, so in protest I’m going to commit
suicide by jumping off the City Hall roof!’ Signed, A disgusted American
citizen, John Doe.’”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: “Editor’s note . . . If you ask this column,
the wrong people are jumping off roofs.”</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, Ann, this is the old fakeroo, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Never mind that, Joe. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: ” . . . and it’s because of the slimy politics
that we have all this unemployment here.” There it is! That’s D. B.
Norton’s opening attack on the Governor!</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Why Jim, it’s just a letter sent in to a
column.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No, no. I can smell it. That’s Norton!</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Good morning, gentlemen. You’re rather
early.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: ’Morning. ’Morning, Governor.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: You’re here rather early.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did you happen to see this in the New Bulletin,
Governor?</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Yes. I had it served with my breakfast
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Jim thinks it’s D. B. Norton at work.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Of course it is!</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Oh, come, Jim. That little item? D. B.
Norton does things in a much bigger way . . .</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This is his opening attack on you, Governor!
Take my word for it! What did he buy a paper for? Why did he hire a
high-pressure editor like Connell for? He’s in the oil business! I tell
you, Governor, he’s after your scalp!</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: All right, Jim. Don’t burst a blood
vessel, I’ll attend to it. Get me Spencer of the Daily Chronicle ,
please.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Yes. Yes. I saw it, Governor . . . and if
you ask me that’s a phoney letter. Why, that gag has got whiskers on it.
Huh? Okay, I’ll get the Mayor and maybe the Chamber of Commerce to go
after them. Get Mayor Lovett on the phone!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hello? Sorry, the Mayor’s busy on the
other phone.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Yes, I know, Mrs. Brewster. It’s a terrible
reflection on our city. I’ve had a dozen calls already.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Spencer of the Chronicle .</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Hold him. Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I’m
listening.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. brewster</strong>: I insist that this John Doe man be
found and given a job at once. If something isn’t done. I’ll call out
the whole Auxiliary �yes, and the Junior Auxiliary, too. We’ll hold a
meeting and see�</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what
about me? it’s my building he’s jumping off of! And I’m up for
re-election, too!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What are you doing? Get Connell at the
Bulletin ! Why, he’s liable to go right past my window, What was
that?!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Out the window! Something just flew by!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I didn’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Well, don’t stand there, you idiot. Go and
look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Is there a crowd in the street?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look
again!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I think it must have been a sea-gull.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: A sea-gull? What’s a sea-gull doing around
the city hall? That’s a bad omen, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely
bird.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I-it’s all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just
a sea-gull. Er. nothing’s happened yet! No, I’m watching. Don’t worry.
Ju-just leave it all to me!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Spencer, I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Hello! Connell! This is� What are you doing?
This is the Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yes, Mayor Lovett! How many times are you
gonna call me? I’ve got everybody and his brother and sister out looking
for him. Did you see the box I’m running?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: “An appeal to John Doe. ‘Think it over,
John. Life can be beautiful,’ says Mayor. ‘If you need a job, apply to
the editor of this paper . . .’” ” and so forth and so forth . . . Okay,
Mayor. I’ll let you know as soon as I have something! What? . . . Well,
pull down the blinds!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: I went up to Miss Mitchell’s house, boss.
Boy, she’s in a bad way.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, do you know something? She supports a
mother and two kids. What do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Did you find her?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: No. Her mother’s awful worried about her.
When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er,
the girl, I mean!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Go out and find her!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn’t
tell you . . .</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Hello! . . . Yeh?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the
doc that saved my mother’s life and wouldn’t take any money for it? You
remember that? Okay, boss, I’ll go and look for her.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Holy smokes, Commissioner. You’ve had
twenty-four hours! Okay, Hawkshaw, grab a pencil. Here it is again.
She’s about five foot five, brown eyes, light chestnut hair and as fine
a pair of legs as . . .</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: . . . ever walked into this office.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Did you want to see me?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: No. I’ve had the whole army and navy
searching for you because that’s a game we play here every day.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I remember, distinctly, being fired.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: That’s right. But you have a piece of
property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I’d like to have
it!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: The letter.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What letter?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: The letter from John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: The whole town’s in an uproar. We’ve got to
find him. The letter’s our only clue.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: There is no letter.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: We’ll get a handwriting expert to�</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: There is no letter.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Say that again.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: There is no letter. I made it up.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: You made it up.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Don’t you know there are nine jobs waiting
for this guy? Twenty-two families want to board him free? Five women
want to marry him, and the Mayor’s practically ready to adopt him? And
you . . .</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: I just called the morgue, boss. They say
there’s a girl there�</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Ann! Say, why didn’t yuh�</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Beany!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole
business quickly.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is
sorry he wrote the letter and�</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: That’s right. You got it! Sure! He came in
here and I made him change his mind. “Bulletin editor saves John Doe’s
life.” Why, it’s perfect. I’ll have Ned write it up. Oh, Ned!</p>
<p><strong>ned’s voice</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I got a story I want yuh to�</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Listen, you great big wonderful genius of a
newspaperman! You came down here to shoot some life into this dying
paper, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, the whole town’s curious about John Doe
and, boom, just like that you’re going to bury him. There’s enough
circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: In what man!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: What John Doe?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius�
Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe�and he walked into this office.
What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I
suppose! Not me! I’d have made a deal with him!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: A deal?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sure! When you get hold of a stunt that sells
papers you don’t drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at
least a couple of months. You know what I’d do? Between now and let’s
say, Christmas, when he’s gonna jump, I’d run a daily yarn starting with
his boyhood, his schooling, his first job! A wide-eyed youngster facing
a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in
the world.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Now, then comes the drama. He meets
discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble.
So what does he do? He decides to commit suicide in protest against the
state of civilization. He thinks of the river! But no, no, he has a
better idea. The City Hall. Why? Because he wants to attract attention.
He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that’s the only way he
can get himself heard.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: So! So he writes me a letter and I dig him up.
He pours out his soul to me, and from now on we quote: “I protest, by
John Doe.” He protests against all the evils in the world; the greed,
the lust, the hate, the fear, all of man’s inhumanity to man.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss
Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: What John Doe?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get
this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and
hire someone to say he’s gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, you’re catching on.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Who, for instance?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Anybody! Er, er�Beany’ll do!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Why sure�Who? Me? Jump off a�Oh, no! Any time
but Christmas. I’m superstitious.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go
on out and get married and have a lot o’ babies�but stay out o’
newspaper business!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Better get that story in, Hank, it’s getting
late.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You’re supposed to be a smart guy! If it was
raining hundred dollar bills, you’d be out looking for a dime you lost
some place.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to
this mad woman.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Look, Chief! Look what the Chronicle is running
on John Doe. They say it’s a fake!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Why, the no-good�low-down� “John Doe story
amateur journalism. It’s palpably phoney. It’s a wonder anyone is taking
it seriously.” What do yuh think of those guys!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s fine! That’s fine! Now fall right into
their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing
off. You know what that’s going to sound like on top of this!</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: “Amateur journalism”, huh? Why, the bunch
of sophomores! I can teach them more about�</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, boss. Get a load of this.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: They all say they wrote the John Doe
letter.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Oh, they all wrote the letter?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Tell them all to wait.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Look, Mr. Connell�one of those men is your John
Doe. They’re desperate and will do anything for a cup of coffee. Pick
one out and you can make the Chronicle eat their words.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I’m beginning to like this.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: If you ask me, Hank, you’re playing around with
dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: No, no, no, the gal’s right. We can’t let
the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We’ve got to produce a John Doe
now.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sure�and there’s no reason for them to find out
the truth, either. Because, naturally, I won’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Okay, sister, you get your job back.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Plus a bonus.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: What bonus?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, the bonus of a thousand dollars the
Chronicle was going to pay me for this little document. You’ll find it
says, er: “I, Ann Mitchell, hereby certify that the John Doe letter was
created by me�”</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I can read. I can read!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: So you think this is worth a thousand
dollars, do you?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt
cheap.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Packs everything, including a gun.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut
and�I’ll eat him.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Okay, Beany, bring ’em in one at a
time.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Did you write that letter to Miss
Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: What are you doing up here then?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: Well, the paper said there were some jobs
around loose. Thought there might be one left over.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Had any schooling?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: Yeah, a little.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What do you do when you work?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: I used to pitch.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Baseball?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: Uh-huh. Till my wing went bad.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Where’d you play?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: Bush leagues mostly.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: How about family? Got any family?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Oh, just traveling through, huh?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He’s
outside.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Looks all right�</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: He’s perfect! A baseball player. What could be
more American!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I wish he had a family, though.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Be less complicated without a family.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Look at that face. It’s wonderful. They’ll
believe him . Come on.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>tall chap</strong>: Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John
Willoughby they called me in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Er, would you, er, would you like to make some
money?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: Henceforth in this script he shall be referred
to as JOHN DOE.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Would you be willing to say you wrote that
letter�and stick by it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s our man. He’s made to order.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I don’t know. He don’t seem like a guy
that’d fall into line.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: When you’re desperate for money, you do a lot
of things, Mr. Connell. He’s our man, I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: He’s fainted! Get some water quickly!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Hurry up, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Right here. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Say, all this John Doe business is batty,
if yuh ask me.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, nobody asked yuh.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Trying to improve the world by jumping off
buildings. You couldn’t improve the world if the building jumped on
you!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t mind the Colonel. He hates people.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: He likes you well enough to stick around.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, that’s ‘cause we both play doohickies. I
met him in a box car a couple o’ years ago. I was foolin’ around with my
harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven’t been able to shake
him since.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: All right, boys, here he is.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, no, no! You can’t take pictures of him like
that�eating a sandwich�and with a beard!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: But, he’s gonna jump off a building!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes, but not because he’s out of a job. That’s
not news! This man’s going to jump as a matter of principle.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Well, maybe you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: We’ll clean him up and put him in a hotel
room�under bodyguards. We’ll make a mystery out of him. Did you speak to
Mr. Norton?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Thinks it’s terrific. Says for us to go the
limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the
state.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, swell! Is that the contract?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yes. What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Friend of his. They play duets together.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Duets? But can we trust him?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I trust him.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that’s fine. I
suppose he trusts you, too?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, stop worrying. He’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: That’s�</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Well, okay. But we don’t want more than a
couple o’ hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is
an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I got it all ready. Here.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Well, that’s fine. Now I want you to sign
this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by
day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one
railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your
arm fixed. That’s what you want, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, but it’s got to be by Bone-Setter
Brown.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign
it. Meanwhile, here’s fifty dollars for spending money. That’s fine.
Beany!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Yeah, Boss?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the
Imperial and hire some bodyguards.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah, and some new clothes, Beany.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Do you think we better have him
de-loused?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yeh, yeh, yeh.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Both of ’em?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yes, both of ’em! But don’t let him out of
your sight.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hey, Beany, gray suit, huh?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Okay, fellows.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Take it easy, John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: And you! Start pounding that typewriter.
Oh, boy! This is terrific! No responsibilities on our part. Just
statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Before you pop too many buttons, don’t forget
to make out that check for a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Awwwww!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Okay, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Now, lemme see. You sit outside the door.
Nobody comes in, see. You two fellas sit in here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, pretty nifty, huh?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You ain’t gonna get me to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure, you are.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: No, sir. That spot under the bridge where
we slept last night’s good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>bell hop</strong>: Hey, what’ll I do with this baggage?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Aw, stick ’em in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Gimme mine. I ain’t staying! You know we
were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe
business came up. You remember that, don’t yuh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop
coming up in the elevator? Mine did.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Aw, Long John . . . I tell you�it’s no
good. You’re gonna get used to a lotta stuff that’s gonna wreck you.
Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket’s beginning to show up on you
already. And don’t pull that on me neither!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stop worrying, Colonel. I’m gonna get my arm
fixed out of this.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Here’s some cigars the boss sent up. Have
one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, cigars!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Naw.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, I’ll bet yuh even the Major Leaguers
don’t rate an outfit like this.</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: Here. Make yourself comfortable.
Paper?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I don’t read no papers and I don’t listen
to radios either. I know the world’s been shaved by a drunken barber and
I don’t have to read it.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I’ve seen guys like you go under before.
Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went
goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy�</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: The first thing that happens to a guy like
that�he starts wantin’ to go into restaurants and sit at a table and eat
salads�and cup cakes�and tea� Boy, what that kinda food does to your
system!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: The next thing the dope wants is a room.
Yessir, a room with steam heat! And curtains and rugs</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain’t
going to ruin me.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I seen plenty of fellers start out with
fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: And let me tell you, Long John. When you
become a guy with a bank account, they got you. Yessir, they got
you!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Who’s got him?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: The heelots!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey. There’s the City Hall tower I’m supposed
to jump off of. It’s even higher than this.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Who’s got him?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: The heelots!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! You ain’t supposed to do
that till Christmas Eve! Wanta get me in a jam?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If it’s gonna get you in a jam, I’ll do you a
favor. I won’t jump.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: And when they get you, you got no more
chance than a road-rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey. Who’d you say was gonna get him?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, is this one of those places where you
ring if you want something?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Yeah. Just use the phone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Boy! I’ve always wanted to do this!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again,
will yuh? Who’s gonna get him?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: The heelots!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Sure. Mostly often.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: All right. You’re walking along�not a
nickel in your jeans�free as the wind�nobody bothers you�hundreds of
people pass yuh by in every line of business�shoes, hats, automobiles,
radio, furniture, everything. They’re all nice, lovable people, and they
let you alone. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s voice</strong>: Then you get hold of some dough,
and what happens?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: All those nice, sweet, lovable people
become heelots. A lotta heels. They begin creeping up on you�trying to
sell you something. They’ve got long claws and they get a strangle-hold
on you�and you squirm�and duck and holler�and you try to push ’em
away�but you haven’t got a chance�they’ve got you! First thing you know,
you own things. A car, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Now your whole life is messed up with more
stuff�license fees�and number plates�and gas and oil�and taxes and
insurance�</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s voice</strong>: . . . and identification cards�and
letters�and bills�and flat tires�and dents�and traffic tickets and
motorcycle cops and court rooms�and lawyers�and fines�</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: And a million and one other things. And
what happens? You’re not the free and happy guy you used to be. You
gotta have money to pay for all those things�so you go after what the
other feller’s got� And there you are�you’re a heelot yourself!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You win, Colonel. Here’s the fifty. Go on out
and get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get
some canned goods�a fishing rod, and the rest I’m gonna give away.</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: Give away?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey. Get me a pitcher’s glove! Got to get some
practice.</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: Say, he’s giving it away! I’m gonna get
me some of that!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, come back here, yuh heelot!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will you send up five hamburgers with all the
trimmings, five chocolate ice cream sodas, and five pieces of apple pie?
No, apple, with cheese. Yeah. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hello there. Well, well! If it isn’t the man
about town!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: All set, Ann?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Huh? Oh, yes. Let’s go. Now, let’s see. We want
some action in these pictures.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Action?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Um-hum.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, no, no. This man’s going to jump off a
roof.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit
down. There. That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You know, he’s got a nice face, hasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: Yeh�he’s pretty.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Here. Sit down! Quiet, egghead! All right, now,
a serious expression.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can’t. I’m feeling too good.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You’re a man
disgusted with all of civilization.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: With all of it?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes, you’re sore at the world. Come on,
now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, crabby guy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah. No, no! No! No, look. You don’t have to
smell the world!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, all those guys in the bleachers
think�</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now
let’s see what you look like when you protest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Against what?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Against anything. Just protest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You got me.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, look. I’m the umpire, and you just cut the
heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would
you do?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, yuh did, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why can’t you call right, you bone-headed,
pig-eared, lop-eared, pot-bellied�</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Grab it, Eddie, grab it!</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: I don’t care whose picture they’re
publishing. I still say that this John Doe person is a myth. And you can
quote me on that. And I’m going to insist on his being produced for
questioning. You know as well as I do that this whole thing is being
engineered by a vicious man with a vicious purpose�Mr. D. B. Norton.</p>
<p><strong>groom</strong>: Mr. Connell and Miss Mitchell are at the
house, sir.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Oh, they are? All right, come on.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Personally, I think it’s just plain stupidity
to drop it now.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You should see his fan mail! Thousands! Why,
it’s going over like a house afire!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: What are you afraid of, Connell? It’s doubled
our circulation.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yeah, but it’s got everybody sore. Ads are
being pulled�the Governor’s starting a libel suit�what’s more, they all
know John Doe’s a phoney�and they insist on seeing him.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, what about it? Let them see him! We’ll go
them one better. They can also hear him. You own a radio station,
Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?</p>
<p><strong>connell’s voice</strong>: Watch out for this dame, D. B.
She’ll drive you batty!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Look. We can’t let ’em get to this
bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night! No telling what
that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday�here he is, standing on a
table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of
town before this thing explodes in our faces!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: If you do, Mr. Norton, you’re just as much of a
dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: No, you’ve got yourself a meal ticket and
you hate to let go.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sure, it’s a meal ticket for me. I admit it,
but it’s also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who’s trying to
crash national politics. That’s what you bought the newspaper for, isn’t
it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don’t you? Well, put John Doe on the
air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of ’em. He can say
anything he wants and they’ll listen to him.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: All right, let’s not forget the Governor, the
Mayor and all small fry like that. This can arouse national interest! If
he made a hit around here�he can do it everywhere else in the country!
And you’ll be pulling the strings, Mr. Norton!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Go down to the office and arrange for some
radio time.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Why, D. B., you’re not going to fall
for�</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I want it as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself.
Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Er, don’t you go. I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: . . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: How much money do you get?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Thirty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after?
I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Money? Well, I’m glad to hear somebody admit
it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that
fellow over?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, I’m sure I can.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Do it, and I’ll give you a hundred dollars a
week.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: A hundred dollars!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: That’s only the beginning. You play your
cards right and you’ll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew
it.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Hello. Whenever there’s a pretty woman
around, er� This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: How do you do!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: All right, Casanova. I’ll give you a break.
See that Miss Mitchell gets a car to take her home.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Always reading my mind, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Thank you very much for everything.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: And, Miss Mitchell�I think from now on you’d
better work directly with me.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh! Hey! Oh, hey! I thought you were
asleep!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: We just wanted to say good night, Sis.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, oh! Oh, you little brats! You’re just
stalling. I said good night!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Come, come, come, children. It’s past your
bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Oh, all right.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Go on!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Come on, Pooch! Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Now, keep Pooch off the bed.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Stick a fork through me! I’m done. I’ll never
get this speech right.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you’re very
clever.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your purse. I need ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What for? I gave you fifty just the other
day.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her
baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn’t a thing in the house�and
then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and�</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: And the fifty’s all gone, huh? Who’s the ten
for?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: The Websters.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: The Websters!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You remember those lovely people your father
used to take care of? I thought I’d buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann,
dear, it’s a shame, those poor�</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You’re marvelous, Ma. You’re just like Father
used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn’t have enough
to eat ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people
are in such need and we have plenty now.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: If you’re thinking of that thousand dollars,
forget it. It’s practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you’ve
just gotta stop giving all your money away.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Oh, Ann, dear!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, Ma. Oh, don’t pay any attention
to me. I guess I’m just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a
great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our
lives, and I’m stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have
six babies!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Do you mean the speech you’re writing?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah, I don’t know. I simply can’t get it to
jell! I created somebody who’s gonna give up his life for a principle,
hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio
and, unless he says something that’s, well, that’s sensational, it’s
just no good!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, honey, of course I don’t know what
kind of a speech you’re trying to write, but judging from the samples
I’ve read, I don’t think anybody’ll listen.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Darling, there are so many complaining
political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and
despair on the radio. If you’re going to have him say anything, why
don’t you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in
it? If your father were alive, he’d know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, yes, Father certainly would.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Wait a minute . . .</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: That’s your father’s diary, Ann.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Father’s . . . I never knew he had a diary.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: There’s enough in it for a hundred speeches,
things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won’t you
dear? It’s always helped keep your father alive for me.</p>
<p><strong>lug</strong>: Wait a minute. John Doe don’t wanta sign no
autographs.</p>
<p><strong>inquirer</strong>: Well, what does he do all day?</p>
<p><strong>lug</strong>: What does he do all day? He’s writin’ out his
memories!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Sorry, lady. you can’t see Mr. Doe. He wants
to be alone. No, no, he just sits around all day and commutes with
himself.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Ba-ll!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I don’t know how you’re gonna stand it
around here till after Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: St-rike!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I know why you’re hangin’ around�you’re
stuck on a girl�that’s all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: What was that? A single?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The first baseman dropped the ball.</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: Butterfingers! That’s tough luck,
Pal.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: When a guy has a woman on his hands�the
first thing he knows his life is balled up with a lot more
things�furniture and�</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: Did you get him?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: You’re out!</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: That’s swell! What’s this�the end of the
eighth?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ninth!</p>
<p><strong>lug</strong>: Hey, Beany! There’s a coupla lugs from the
Chronicle snooping around out here!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Come on, Angelface! Gangway!</p>
<p><strong>lug</strong>: What’s the score, Angelface?</p>
<p><strong>angelface</strong>: Three to two�our favor.</p>
<p><strong>lug</strong>: Gee, that’s great!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You’ve got swell form. Must have been a pretty
good pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready for
the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin’ a
nineteen-inning game!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Nineteen!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yep. There was a major league scout there
watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do
you know what? I couldn’t life my arm to sign it. But I’ll be okay again
as soon as I get it fixed up.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you mean, too bad?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Huh? Oh, that you’ll never be able to play
again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, what are you talking about? I just told
you I was gonna get a�</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, you know how they are in baseball�if a
guy’s mixed up in a racket�</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Racket? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe
business. Why, as soon as it comes out it’s all a fake, you’ll be washed
up in baseball, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about
that. Gosh!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: And another thing, what about all the kids in
the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna
think about you? Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his
glove�flopped into a chair�and has taken out his ocarina.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Hey, did you hear that, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I gotta figure some way out of this thing!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: The elevators are still runnin’.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I know one way you can do it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, when you get up on the radio, all you
have to do is say the whole thing’s a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as
you’re born!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, that’s a cinch. I know somebody that’ll
give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Five thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah. Five thousand dollars. And he gets it
right away. You don’t have to wait till Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Look out, Long John! They’re closing in on
you!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, who’s putting up this dough?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Feller runs the Chronicle . Here’s the speech
you make�and it’s all written out for you.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Five thousand dollars! Holy mackerel! I can
see the heelots comin’. The whole army of them!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s on the level.</p>
<p><strong>1st girl</strong>: No, I’m sorry. Tickets for the broadcast
are all gone. Phone the Bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>2nd girl</strong>: Sorry. No more tickets left.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Here he is.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hello, John. All set for the big night?
Swell!</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>2nd photographer</strong>: One moment�hold it! Now stand
still, Mr. Doe.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Okay, Beany, take them outside.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Now, look, John. Here’s the speech. It’s in
caps and double-spaced. You won’t have any trouble reading it. Not

Oh, we’ll stop it!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Sorry, ladies. Mr. Doe can’t be bothered now.
He’s gotta make a speech out there, and�</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Have you got the speech I gave you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Now, look. I’ll give this money to the Colonel

entrance for you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: How’d you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Huh? Oh, I just came in to wish him luck.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Come on, out. Out! Mother says good luck, too.

it. He’s turned out to be a wonderful person, John.</p>

<p><strong>ann</strong>: John Doe, the one in the speech.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You know something? I’ve actually fallen in
love with him.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: All right, there he is, sister. Now, come
on�plenty of oomph!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: No, no, no. Now that’s too much!</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: One moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: This is no time for cheap publicity,
Mr. Connell!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to
get something out of it. I’m getting a Jane Doe ready!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s fine, honey. Now, get out!</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: All right. I need one more.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: How’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: All right, Beany�bring ’em in!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Holy smoke! A half a heelot!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: There you are, Boss, just like you ordered.
Symbols of the little people.</p>

<p><strong>ann</strong>: This is ridiculous, Mr. Connell! Come on, give

<p><strong>boy midget</strong>: Come on, Snooks�you better bail out.</p>
<p><strong>girl midget</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Doe!</p>

go!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Wow! One minute to go, and the score is nothing
to nothing! Now, please, John, you won’t let me down, will you? Will
you? ’Course you won’t. If you’ll just think of yourself as the real
John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Hey�what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Okay! We’re coming. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Now, listen, John. You’re a pitcher. Now, get

<p><strong>studio official</strong>: Give him room, let him through.
Come on.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Hey. Let’s get out o’ here. There’s the

<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Hey, what’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: That’s what I’d like to know!</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Come on, out. Out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, he’s a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Never mind. Let him alone. He’s all right. I’ll
be right over there pulling for you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, John�over here.</p>
<p><strong>2nd m.c.</strong>: Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Phone the Chronicle . Tell ’em to start
getting those extras out.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Kenneth Frye, speaking for the New Bulletin . Tonight we give
you something entirely new and different. Standing beside me is the
young man who has declared publicly that on Christmas Eve he intends to
commit suicide, giving as his reason�quote: “I protest against the state
of civilization.” End quote. Ladies and gentlemen, the New Bulletin
takes pleasure in presenting the man who is fast becoming the most
talked-of person in the whole country,</p>
<p><strong>john doe!</strong>: The man next to him waves his hand�there
is an outburst of music.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen: I am the man you all
know as John Doe. I took that name because it seems to describe�because
it seems to describe</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Well, it was me�before I said I was
gonna jump off the City Hall roof at midnight on Christmas Eve. Now, I
guess I’m not average any more. Now, I’m getting all sorts of attention,
from big shots, too.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’ve been double-crossed!</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: We have!?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The Mayor and the Governor, for instance. They
don’t like those articles I’ve been writing.</p>
<p><strong>spencer’s voice</strong>: You’re an imposter, young fella!
That’s a pack of lies you’re telling!</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Who wrote that speech for you?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Beany, get that guy!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: That’s Spencer!</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, the disturbance you just
heard was caused by someone in the audience who tried to heckle Mr. Doe.
The speech will continue.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, people like the Governor People like the
Governor and that fella there can�can stop worrying. I’m not gonna talk
about them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m gonna talk about us, the average guys, the
John Does. If anybody should ask you what the average John Doe is like,
you couldn’t tell him because he’s a million and one things. He’s
Mr. Big and Mr. Small. He’s simple and he’s wise. He’s inherently
honest, but he’s got a streak of larceny in his heart. He seldom walks
up to a public telephone without shoving his finger into the slot to see
if somebody left a nickel there.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: He’s the man the ads are written for.
He’s the fella everybody sells things to. He’s Joe Doakes, the world’s
greatest stooge and the world’s greatest strength. Yes, sir. Yessir,
we’re a great family, the John Does. We’re the meek who are, er,
supposed to inherit the earth. You’ll find us everywhere. We raise the
crops, we dig the mines, work the factories, keep the books, fly the
planes and drive the busses! And when a cop yells: “Stand back there,
you!” He means us, the John Does!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, what kind of a speech is that? Didn’t you
read it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ve existed since time began. We built the
pyramids, we saw Christ crucified, pulled the oars for Roman emperors,
sailed the boats for Columbus, retreated from Moscow with Napoleon and
froze with Washington at Valley Forge! Yes, sir. We’ve been in there
dodging left hooks since before history began to walk! In our struggle
for freedom we’ve hit the canvas many a time, but we always bounced
back!</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Because we’re the people �and we’re
tough!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They’ve started a lot of talk about free
people going soft�that we can’t take it. That’s a lot of hooey! . . . A
free people can beat the world at anything, from war to tiddle-de-winks,
if we all pull in the same direction!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know a lot of you are saying “What can I do?
I’m just a little punk. I don’t count.” Well, you’re dead wrong! The
little punks have always counted because in the long run the character
of a country is the sum total of the character of its little punks.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: But we’ve all got to get in there and
pitch! We can’t win the old ball game unless we have team work. And
that’s where every John Doe comes in! It’s up to him to get together
with his teammate!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And your teammates, my friends, is the guy
next door to you. Your neighbor! He’s a terribly important guy, that guy
next door! You’re gonna need him and he’s gonna need you . . . so look
him up! If he’s sick, call on him! If he’s hungry, feed him! If he’s out
of a job, find him one! To most of you, your neighbor is a stranger, a
guy with a barking dog, and a high fence around him.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Now, you can’t be a stranger to any
guy that’s on your own team. So tear down the fence that separates you,
tear down the fence and you’ll tear down a lot of hates and prejudices!
Tear down all the fences in the country and you’ll really have
teamwork!</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: I know a lot of you are saying to
yourselves: “He’s asking for a miracle to happen. He’s expecting people
to change all of a sudden.” Well, you’re wrong. It’s no miracle. It’s no
miracle because I see it happen once every year. And so do you. At
Christmas time! There’s something swell about the spirit of Christmas,
to see what it does to people, all kinds of people . . .</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now, why can’t that spirit, that same warm
Christmas spirit last the whole year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if
each and every John Doe would make that spirit last three hundred and
sixty-five days out of the year, we’d develop such a strength, we’d
create such a tidal wave of good will, that no human force could stand
against it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, sir, my friends, the meek can only
inherit the earth when the John Does start loving their neighbors. You’d
better start right now. Don’t wait till the game is called on account of
darkness! Wake up, John Doe! You’re the hope of the world!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John! You were wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Now you’re talking!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Gangway, you heelots!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I knew you’d wake up sooner or later! Boy,
am I glad we got out of that mess.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I had that five thousand bucks sewed up! Could
have been on my way to old Doc Brown! “You’re a pitcher, John,” she
said, “Now go in there and pitch! What a sucker!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Yeah, she’s a heelot just like the rest of
them. It’s lucky you got away from her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What was I doin’ up there makin’ a speech,
anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . .
.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore
one picket off of your neighbor’s fence he’d sue you!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Five thousand bucks! I had it right in my
hand!</p>
<p><strong>d.b.</strong>: What do you mean, he ran away? Well, go after
him! Find him! That man is terrific!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Jitterbugs.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Four bits.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Better make it doughnuts, huh?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What’ll it be, gents?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you got a coupla steaks about that big
and about that thick?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Er, yeh, with hash-brown potatoes and
tomatoes and�and apple pie and ice cream and coffee�</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: And doughnuts! I know. Hey, Ma! Sinkers, a
pair!</p>
<p><strong>ma’s voice</strong>: Sinkers, a pair, coming up.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Glad he took the “T” out of that.</p>
<p><strong>the john doe club”.</strong>: Int. DAN’s beanery: Close-up:
JOHN and the COLONEL.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Join the John Doe Club.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: John Doe Club?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Oh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Are you John Doe?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You need glasses, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Well, he’s the spittin’ image of�</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Yeah, but his name’s Willoughby.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Long John Willoughby. I’m a baseball
player.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh, no. I’d know that voice anywhere. You can’t
kid me! You’re John Doe! Hey, Ma! Ma! That’s John Doe!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Yeah. Sitting right there, big as life.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Who’d you say it was?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: John Doe! The big guy there! Picture’s in the
paper!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hey, Operator? Dan’s Beanery. Look. Call
everybody in town. John Doe was just in my place. Yeh. He ordered
doughnuts.</p>
<p><strong>townspeople</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>mayor hawkins</strong>: I know, you all voted for me and
you’re all anxious to see John Doe. We’re all neighbors, but my office
is packed like a sardine box.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What does John Doe look like, Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>mayor hawkins</strong>: Oh, he’s one of those great big
outdoor type of men. No, you can’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>mayor hawkins</strong>: You didn’t vote for me the last time.
Shame on you�get off my front porch!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Better let me talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: All right, but present it to him as a great
cause for the common man.</p>
<p><strong>mayor hawkins</strong>: Ah, here he comes! Give him room down
there! Give him room, folks! How do you do, Mr. Norton! I’m the
Mayor�</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>mayor hawkins</strong>: Let me go, you dern fool! I’m the
Mayor! Mr. Norton! I’m Mayor Hawkins. Your office telephoned me to hold
him.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Well, that’s fine. How is he?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Oh, he’s fine. He’s right in my office there.
You know, this is a great honor having John Doe here, and you too.
Haven’t had so much excitement since the old city hall burned down.
People were so excited, they nearly tore his clothes off. Oh, Matilda
darling, phone the newspapers. Tell them Mr. Norton is here. Step right
inside, Mr. Norton�my office is very comfortable here, Mr. Norton. Just
had it air-conditioned. Gangway, please. Make room for Mr. Norton.
Gangway, gangway. Here he is, Mr. Norton, well taken care of. The
neighbors are serving him a light lunch.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hello, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Mister Mayor, if you don’t mind, we’d like to
talk to him alone.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Why, certainly, certainly. All right,
everybody, clear out.</p>
<p><strong>mayor’s wife</strong>: Quit pushing.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Don’t argue with me here. Wait till we get
home.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Don’t you push me around like that! Even
though I’m your wife, you can’t push me around�</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Ohhhh!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, Mr. Norton, I think you’ve got a lot of
nerve having those people hold us here.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: There’s nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.
It’s only natural that people�</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, if there’s nobody holding us here, let’s
get going. Incidentally, my name isn’t Doe. It’s Willoughby.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Look, John. Something terribly important’s
happened. They’re forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and
they say that there’s going�</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: John Doe Clubs? What for?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked
about in your radio speech.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t care what they’re forming. I’m on my
way and I don’t like the idea of being stopped either.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, but you don’t know how big this thing is.
You should see the thousands of telegrams we’ve received and what
they’re saying about you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, it started as a circulation stunt,
didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Uh-huh . . .</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don’t
you let me alone?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it
isn’t any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe
Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Why, certainly. With your ability to
influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, let’s get something straight here. I
don’t want any part of this thing. If you’ve got an idea I’m going
around lecturing to people, why you’re crazy! Baseball’s my racket, and
I’m sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Please, please! I just got rid of one
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, but please. Mr. Mayor, tell him the John
Doe Club wants to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Let them in, Mr. Mayor. Let them come in.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Okay, folks, but remember your manners. No
stampeding. Walk slow, like you do when you come to pay your taxes.</p>
<p><strong>someone</strong>: Come on, Bert.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Okay. All right, give me a chance.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Come right in.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: My name’s Bert Hansen, Mr. Doe, I’m the head
soda jerker at Schwabacher’s Drug Store.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, sir, you see, me and my wife, we heard
your broadcast, and we got quite a bang out of it, especially my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Kept me up half the night saying “That man’s
right, honey. The trouble with the world is�nobody gives a hoot about
his neighbor. That’s why everybody in town’s sore and cranky at each
other.”</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, anyway, the next morning I’m out
watering the lawn and I look over and there’s Sourpuss on the other side
of the hedge straightening out a dent in his fender and, er, my wife
yells to me out of the window. She says, “Go on. Speak to him, Bert.”
And I figured, well, heck, I can’t lose anything�so I yelled over to him
“Good morning, Mr. Smithers.” He went right on pounding his fender, and
was I burned! So I turned around to give my wife a dirty look and she
said, “Louder, louder. He didn’t hear you.” So, in a voice you could of
heard in the next county, I yelled. “Good morning, Mr. Smithers!”</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, sir, you coulda knocked me over with a
feather. Old Sourpuss turned around surprised like, and he put on a big
smile, came over and took my hand like an old lodge brother, and he
said. “Good morning, Hansen. I’ve been wanting to talk to you for years,
only I thought you didn’t like me.” And then he started chatting away
like a happy little kid, and he got so excited his eyes begin waterin’
up.</p>
<p><strong>bert’s voice</strong>: Well, Mr. Doe, before we got through,
I found out Smithers is a swell egg, only he’s pretty deaf, and that
accounts for all the noises.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: And he says it’s a shame how little we know
about our neighbors, and then he got an idea, and he said, “How’s about
inviting everybody some place where we can all get together and know
each other a little better?” Well, I’m feeling so good by this time, I’m
ripe for anything.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: So Smithers goes around the neighborhood
inviting everybody to a meeting at the school house and I tell everybody
that comes in the store, including Mr. Schwabacher, my boss. Oh, I’m
talking too much.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, I’ll be doggoned if over forty people
don’t show up. ’Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a
kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one
another.</p>
<p><strong>bert’s wife</strong>: Tell him about making Sourpuss
chairman, honey.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and
decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally,
this is my wife. Come here, honey.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: This is my wife, Mr. Doe.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Doe . . . Er, Sourpuss is
here, too.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, is he?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er,
Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: Th�that’s all right. If you didn’t call me
Sourpuss, it wouldn’t feel natural.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, anyway, I�I guess nearly everybody in
the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big
house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds
drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back
counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the
milkman spoke up and he said, “Say, you’ve got the Delaneys all wrong.”
And then he tells</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: Old man Delaney has been bringing his
furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling
it.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah. And, well, sir, a half a dozen of us ran
over there to fetch them and we got them to the meeting. What a
reception they got. Why, everybody shook hands with them and made a fuss
over them, and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney just sat right down
and cried.</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: And then we started to find out about a
lot of other people.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for
instance.</p>
<p><strong>bert’s wife</strong>: Grubbel’s here. See?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah. That’s�that’s him. Of course, you don’t
know Grubbel, but he’s the man that everybody figured was the worst
no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and
nobody’d have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the
postman told us the truth. “Why, Grubbel,” he says, “he lives out of
garbage cans because he won’t take charity. Because it’d ruin his
self-respect,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>bert’s wife</strong>: Just like you said on the radio,
Mr. Doe.</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: Well, sir, about a dozen families got
together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn’t that
wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they’ve all
gone off relief!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a
job in his warehouse for old man Delaney�</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: And he gave you that five dollar raise.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah! Wasn’t that swell! Med. shot: Around
MAYOR HAWKINS. He steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Why, Bert, I feel slighted. I’d like to join
but nobody asked me.</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: Well, I’m sorry, Mayor, but we voted that
no politicians could join.</p>
<p><strong>bert’s wife</strong>: Just the John Does of the neighborhood.
Cause you know how politicians are.</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: Yeah . . .</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, er, the reason we wanted to tell you
this, Mr. Doe, was to give you an idea what you started. And from where
I’m sitting, I don’t see any sense in your jumping off any building.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye,
Mr. Doe. You’re a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty
useful walking around for a while.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Well, goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: Goodbye Mr. Doe.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I’m Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe . . . and God
bless you, my boy. The two OLD PEOPLE leave.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gee, whiz�I’m all mixed up�I don’t get it.
Look, all those swell people think I’m gonna jump off a building or
something.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I never had any such idea. Gosh! A fella’d
have to be a mighty fine example himself to go around telling other
people how to�Say, look, what happened the other night was on account of
Miss Mitchell, here. She wrote the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Don’t you see what a wonderful thing this can
be? But we need you , John.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You’re hooked! I can see that right
now.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: They got you. Well, I’m through. For three
years I’ve been trying to get you up to the Columbia River country.
First, it was your glass arm. Then it was the radio. And now it’s the
John Doe clubs. Well, I ain’t waiting another minute.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Gangway, you heelots!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Colonel! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Colonel!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Oh, please, Mr. Doe�</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Colonel!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I want you personally to go along with John
Doe and Miss Mitchell and handle the press and the radio.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Yes. I don’t want to take any chances. And
Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Yes. D. B.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Your crew will do the mop up job. They’ll
follow John Doe into every town, see that the clubs are properly
organized and the charters issued.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: There are only eight flags up there now. I
want to see that map covered before we get through!</p>
<p><strong>“goodbye john doe, call again”</strong>: 2. Close-ups of JOHN
speaking�superimposed over long shots of audiences of various types.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: This has been growing like wildfire! If
they only made demands, but the John Does ask for nothing!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: People are going off relief! If this keeps up,
I’ll be out of a job!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: As soon as he gets strong enough, we’ll find
out what John Doe wants! Thirty every Thursday�sixty at sixty�who knows
what!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m sorry, boss. they just won’t let anybody
talk politics to them. It’s, it’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We’ve got to get to them! They represent
millions of voters!</p>
<p><strong>doe headquarters.”</strong>: Int. JOHN DOE headquarters. Med.
shot: D.B. standing behind his desk, speaking to a group of people in
front of him. We recognize the MAYOR, and the President of the Chamber
of Commerce. Representatives of several other branches of the City
Administration are also present. CONNELL sits near D. B.�scrutinizing
him thoughtfully. On the other side of D. B. is TED SHELDON.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this thing
has been nothing short of a prairie fire. We’ve received so many
applications for charters to the John Doe Clubs we haven’t been able to
take care of them.</p>
<p><strong>mayor lovett</strong>: I’d hate to have that many pins stuck
in me!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: This John Doe convention is a natural. It’s
gonna put our city on the map. Why, over twentyfour hundred John Doe
clubs are sending delegates. Can you imagine that? You, Mr. Mayor, will
be the official host. You will make the arrangements for decorating the
city, parades and a reception for John Doe when he gets home! And�don’t
wear your high hat!</p>
<p><strong>mayor lovett</strong>: No high hat?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: No high hat. And from you, Connell, I want a
special John Doe edition every day until the convention is over.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Don’t worry, D. B. Everything’ll be taken
care of!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>committee woman</strong>: Isn’t it all too wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>photographer’s voice</strong>: Oh, Mr. Mayor, would you step
right in the front row, please? Will you ladies get close to him? That’s
it!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Well, I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Huh? Get what?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Look, D. B. I’m supposed to know my way
around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention’s
gonna cost plenty.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Well, I’m stuck with two and two�but I’m a
sucker if I can make four out of it. Where do you come in?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Why�uh� Why, I’ll have the satisfaction of
knowing that my money has been spent for a worthy cause.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I see. I’d better stick to running the
paper, huh?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I think maybe you’d better. And Connell�I’d
like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we
have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave
her a thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yes. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, we leave for the airport in half an
hour. Is that Johnny-boy’s room? I’d better hustle him up!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: He’ll be ready on time. He’s packing now.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ah, good! Did you see his picture on the
cover of Time ?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I gotta give you credit, Annie-girl. I’ve
handled a good many big promotions in my time . . . everything from the
world’s fair to a channel swimmer, but this one has certainly got me
spinning. And now a John Doe Convention! Wow! Say! If you could only get
him to jump off the City Hall roof on Christmas Eve, I’d guarantee you
half a million people there.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: What do you make of him?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who, Johnny-boy?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, I don’t know what angle you want, but
I’ll give it to you quick. Number one, he’s got great yokel appeal; but
he’s a nice guy. Number two, he’s beginning to believe he really wrote
that original suicide letter that you made up. Number three, he thinks
that you’re Joan of Arc or something!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Number four, well, you know what number
four is. He’s nuts about you. Yeah, it’s running out of his ears.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You left out number five. We’re all heels, me
especially.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Holy smoke!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m all packed.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Good. I’ll go and get Beany-boy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, Charlie-boy!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Huh? CHARLIE winks good-naturedly and
exits. JOHN turns to ANN, who concentrates on her packing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can I help you pack?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do you care if I sit down out here?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It
was about you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: About me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your
father.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There was, there was something I was trying to
stop you from doing. So, er, so I got up out of bed and I walked right
through the wall here, right straight into your room. You know how
dreams are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And there you were in bed. But you�you were a
little girl. You know�about ten.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And very pretty, too. So, I shook you, and the
moment you opened your eyes, you hopped out of bed and started running
like the devil, in your nightgown.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And the nightgown had changed into a beautiful
wedding gown. You sure looked pretty, too. And then I knew what it was I
was trying to stop you from doing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dreams are sure crazy, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, would you like to know who it was you
were marrying?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends
you flowers every day. Er, what’s his name? Mr. Norton’s nephew.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Ted Sheldon.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, that’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But here’s the funniest part of it all. I was
the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the
Peace or something . . .</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You were? I thought you were chasing me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then,
see? But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was
the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I guess so. Then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I took you across my knee and I started
spanking you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That is, I didn’t do it. I mean, I did do it,
but it wasn’t me. You see, I was your father then. Well, I laid you
across my knee and I said: “Annie, I won’t allow you to marry a man
that’s, that’s just rich, or that has his secretary send you flowers.
The man you marry has got to swim rivers for you! He’s got to climb high
mountains for you! He’s got to slay dragons for you! He’s got to perform
wonderful deeds for you! Yes, sir!”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And all the time, er, the guy up there, you
know, with the book, me, just stood there nodding his head and he said,
“Go to it, Pop, whack her one for me, because that’s just the way I feel
about it, too.”</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Well, if you’re through whacking her, come
on, let’s get going. Okay, fellows, right in here. You go out the side
entrance. There’s a bunch of autograph seekers out front. We’ll be down
with the bags in a minute. Come on! Don’t make a government project out
of this!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How’re you, Beany?</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: When does our plane take off again.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: In a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How many people do you think we’ve talked to
already, outside the radio, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I don’t know. About three hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it,
Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe
Clubs the way they do? I’ve been trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Look, John�what we’re handing them are
platitudes. Things they’ve heard a million times: “Love thy neighbor,”
“Clouds have silver linings,” “Turn the other cheek.” It’s just a�</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I’ve heard them a million times, too,
but�there you are. Maybe they’re like me. Just beginning to get an idea
what those things mean.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know, I never thought much about people
before. They were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers. The
only time I worried about them was if they�is when they didn’t come in
to see me pitch. You know, lately I’ve been watching them while I talked
to them. I could see something in their faces. I could feel that they
were hungry for something. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe that’s why they came. Maybe they were
just lonely and wanted somebody to say hello to. I know how they feel.
I’ve been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: All aboard, folks!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, somebody else sitting there?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: No, no, no�that’s your seat.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And this is your coat.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mine?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: A little token of appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh! Oh, it’s beautiful, D. B. Well�I don’t
quite know what to say . . .</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Well, don’t say anything at all. Just sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Go ahead, open it, open it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh! Oh, it’s lovely!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And a new contract goes with it.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Well, come on, spring it! You’ve got something
on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Must be stupendous.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: You know, that’s what I like about her. Right
to the point, like that! All right, practical Annie, here it is.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen
thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe
will announce the formation of a third party.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: A third party?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Yes. The John Doe Party.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Devoted entirely to the interests of all the
John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent
of the voters. He will also announce the third party’s candidate for the
presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian;
the best friend the John Does have.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mr. D. B. Norton!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>n.b.c. announcer</strong>: And although the opening of the
convention is hours off, the delegates are already pouring into the ball
park by the droves, with lunch baskets, banners and petitions, asking
John Doe not to jump off any roof . . .</p>
<p><strong>knox manning</strong>: It is still a phenomenal movement. The
John Does, or the hoi polloi as you’ve heard people call them, have been
laughed at and ridiculed but here they are, gay and happy, having
traveled thousands of miles, their expenses paid by their neighbors, to
come here to pay homage to their hero, John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>john b. hughes</strong>: And in these days of wars and
bombings, it’s a hopeful sign that a simple idea like this can sweep the
country, an idea based on friendliness, on giving and not taking, on
helping your neighbor and asking nothing in return. And if a thing like
this can happen, don’t let any of our grumbling friends tell you that
humanity is falling apart. This is John B. Hughes, signing off now and
returning you to our main studio until nine o’clock when the convention
will officially open.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Oh, John. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, I’m kinda�it’s raining out a little�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: It’s good to see you. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s for Ann . . .</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Oh, how nice! Thank you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Flowers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: I’m terribly sorry she isn’t
here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: No, she just left. I’m surprised you
didn’t run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton’s house.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Did you want to see her about
something important?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, my coat’s pretty wet. I’m afraid I might
have wet the couch a little.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I guess I’ll see her at the convention
later.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Yes, of course. I’ll see that she
gets the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, Mrs. Mitchell, I, er, I’m kinda glad Ann
isn’t here. You see, I was, I came over here hoping to see her alone and
kinda hoping I wouldn’t, too. You know what I mean? There was something
I wanted to talk to her about. But, well, I�It’ll wait, I guess. Good
night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell’s voice</strong>: Good night, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, look, Mrs. Mitchell, have you ever been
married?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I guess I’d better be going at that!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell’s voice</strong>: John. My husband said: “I
love you. Will you marry me?”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He did? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: I married him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, yeah. That’s what I mean. See? It was easy
as all that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know
I love Ann and it’s gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because,
well, you know, she’s so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a
bush-league pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And you know, I think she’s in love with
another man, the one she made up. You know, the real John Doe. Well,
that’s pretty tough competition.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I bet you he’d know how to say it all right.
And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never
get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I’ve got
is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta
prepare her for the shock!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: You mean you’d like me to do it,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I was thinking that�Yeah, you know, sort
of break the ice.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Of course I will, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gee whiz! Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: This John Doe meeting is gonna be one of the
biggest things that ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Why, they’re coming from all over; trains,
box cars, wagons� look out!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello, bodyguards! Hey, had your dinner
yet?</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, look. No. Go ahead and have your dinner.
I’ll�</p>
<p><strong>connell’s voice</strong>: Wait a minute, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello, Mr. Connell.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Hiyah, John. John, I want to have a little
talk with you. What’s the matter�are you falling? Come here.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. Say, tell me
something did you read that speech you’re gonna make tonight?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I never read the speeches before I make
them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Uh-huh. That’s exactly what I thought.
Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech.
There’s a copy on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me
not to leave him, not even for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Go on, go on, go on. And we’ll be at Jim’s
Bar up the street.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: You’re a nice guy, John. I like you. You’re
gentle. I like gentle people. Me? I’m hard�hard and tough. I got no use
for hard people. Gotta be gentle to suit me. Like you, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yep, I’m hard. But you want to know
something? I’ve got a weakness. You’d never guess that, would you? Well,
I have. Want to know what it is?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: The Star Spangled Banner. Screwy, huh?
Well, maybe it is. But play the “Star Spangled Banner”�and I’m a sucker
for it. It always gets me right here�</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. It gets me right back here.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Oh, back there, huh? Well, every man to his
own taste.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: You weren’t old enough for the first world
war, were you?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Course not. Must have been a kid.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I was. I was just ripe. And rarin’ to go.
Know what my old man did when I joined up? He joined up too.</p>
<p><strong>connell’s voice</strong>: Got to be a sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: That’s a kick for you. We were in the same
outfit. Funny, huh?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: He was killed, John.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I saw him get it. I was right there and saw
it with my own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Me? I came out of it without a scratch.
Except for my ulcers. Should be drinking milk. This stuff’s poison.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Hey, Tubby!</p>
<p><strong>bartender’s voice</strong>: Yes, Mr. Connell?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Whadda you say?</p>
<p><strong>tubby</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yessir. I’m a sucker for this country.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Now, that’s all right, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You betcha.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: All right. And we don’t want anybody coming
around changing it, do we?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: No, sir. And when they do I get mad! I get
b-boiling mad. And right now, John, I’m sizzling!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I get mad for a lot of other guys besides
myself�I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named
Jefferson�and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world!
You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, you bet!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Listen, pal�this fifth column stuff’s
pretty rotten, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. It certainly is.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: And you’d feel like an awful sucker if you
found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: And you, of course you wouldn’t know it
because you’re gentle. But that’s what you’re doing. You’re mixed up
with a skunk, my boy, a no-good, dangerous skunk!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, you’re not talking about Mr. Norton, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I’m not talking about his grandfather’s pet
poodle!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, ’cause he’s
been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Yeah? Say, you’re sold on the John Doe
idea, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Sure. I don’t blame you. So am I.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: It’s a beautiful miracle. A miracle that
could only happen right here in the good old U.S.A. And I think it’s
terrific! What do you think of that! Me! Hard-boiled Connell! I think
it’s plenty terrific!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: All right! Now, supposing a certain
unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to
shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he
could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about
that? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nobody’s gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They
can’t use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That’s the main idea.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Is that so? Then what’s a big political
boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a
lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.’s house right now? Wolves,
John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those
speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: They can’t, huh? Who do you think writes
’em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.</p>
<p><strong>connell’s voice</strong>: And get a big bonus for doing them,
too. A mink coat and a diamond bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Don’t write ‘em? Why, that gold-grabbin’
dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shut up! If you weren’t drunk I’d�</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, Boss! Here’s the speech, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Go on and read it, John, and then start
socking!</p>
<p><strong>beany</strong>: Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: . . . Tubby?</p>
<p><strong>beany’s voice</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Better bring me a glass of milk.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: I’m smoking too much.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: . . . Yes, Charlie? You’ve got everything all
set? Fine! Has John Doe been taken care of? Good! How many people do you
think will be there?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Fifteen thousand? Oh my, that’s fine. Now,
listen, Charlie, as soon as John Doe stops talking about me, I want you
to start that demonstration. And make it a big one, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t worry about that, D. B. My boys are
there. They’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: What? yes, I’ll be there fifteen minutes
after I get your call.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Why, Mr. Doe . . .</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: In the dining room, sir.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Well, gentlemen, I think we’re about ready to
throw that great big bombshell�</p>
<p><strong>someone’s voice</strong>: Yeah, well it’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Even a conservative estimate shows that we
can count on anywhere between ten and twenty million John Doe votes.
Now, add to that the labor vote that Mr. Bennett will throw in . . .</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: . . . and the votes controlled by Mr. Hammett
and the rest of you gentlemen in your territories� and nothing can stop
us!</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: As I said before, I’m with you�providing you
can guarantee the John Doe vote.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Don’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>bennett</strong>: You can count on me under one condition.
Little Bennett’s gotta be taken care of!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Didn’t I tell you that everybody in this room
would be taken care? My agreement with you gentlemen stands!</p>
<p><strong>barrington</strong>: I’m with you, D. B., but I still think
it’s a very daring thing we’re attempting!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: These are daring times, Mr. Barrington. We’re
coming to a new order of things. There’s been too much talk going on in
this country.</p>
<p><strong>someone’s voice</strong>: Exactly�</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Too many concessions have been made! What the
American people need is an iron hand!</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: You’re right!</p>
<p><strong>bennett</strong>: That’s true. You’re quite right, D.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Discipline!</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Quite right! Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: And now� may I offer a little toast to Miss
Ann Mitchell�the brilliant and beautiful lady who is responsible for all
this!</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Miss Mitchell! Miss Mitchell!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Mr. Norton, I’d like to talk to you alone for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Oh, oh. Miss Mitchell has something to say to
us.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Well, that’s fine. Speech! Speech!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John! I’m so glad to see you. I�I was terribly
worried.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Yes, I did, John. But I�I had no idea what was
going on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s a swell bracelet you’re wearing.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: John� Why aren’t you at the convention?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Is there anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, no. Nothing’s wrong. Everything’s fine! So
there’s gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody’s gonna cut
himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh? You forgot one detail,
Mr. Big Shot�you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you
or anybody else thinks he’s gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own
rotten purpose, he’s gonna have to do it over my dead body!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on!
That’s rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and
I’ll decide whether or not they’re being properly used!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No you won’t! You’re through deciding
anything!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And what’s more, I’m going down to that
convention and I’m gonna tell those people exactly what you and all your
fine-feathered friends here are trying to cook up for them!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And I’ll say it in my own words this time.</p>
<p><strong>hammett and others</strong>: Stop him, somebody! He’ll ruin
us, D.</p>
<p><strong>b.!</strong>: Med. shot: At Door. As JOHN reaches it, TED
steps up in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wait a minute, young feller�my uncle wants to
talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Listen to me, my son! Before you lose your
head completely, may I remind you that I picked you up out of the gutter
and I can throw you right back there again! You’ve got a nerve accusing
people of things! These gentlemen and I know what’s the best for the
John Does of America, regardless of what tramps like you think!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do you mean to tell me you’d try to kill the
John Doe movement if you can’t use it to get what you want?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.’s voice</strong>: You bet your bottom dollar we
would!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, that certainly is a new low. I guess
I’ve seen everything now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You sit there back of your big cigars and
think of deliberately killing an idea that’s made millions of people a
little bit happier! An idea that’s brought thousands of them here from
all over the country, by bus and by freight, in jallopies and on foot�so
they could pass on to each other their own simple little
experiences.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Why, look, I’m just a mug and I know
it. But I’m beginning to understand a lot of things. Why, your type’s
old as history. If you can’t lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea and
twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket, you slap it
down! Like dogs, if you can’t eat something, you bury it!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why, this is the one worthwhile thing that’s
come along. People are finally finding out that the guy next door isn’t
a bad egg. That’s simple, isn’t it? And yet a thing like that’s got a
chance of spreading till it touches every last doggone human being in
the world�and you talk about killing it!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why, when this fire dies down, what’s going to
be left? More misery, more hunger and more hate. And what’s to prevent
that from starting all over again? Nobody knows the answer to that one,
and certainly not you, with those slimy, bolloxed-up theories you’ve
got! The John Doe idea may be the answer, though! It may be the one
thing capable of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you sit back there on
your fat hulks and tell me you’ll kill it if you can’t use it!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You bet it is, John!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And that’s exactly what I’m going down there
to tell those people!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wait a minute, you ungrateful rat! My Uncle’s
been too good to�</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He’s getting away!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Get the Bulletin !</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>barrington</strong>: I’ve always told you, D. B. you’re
playing with dynamite!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Don’t let that girl get away!</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: Before he gets through tonight he’ll ruin us
all!</p>
<p><strong>bennett</strong>: You’ve got to stop him, D. B.!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I’ll stop him! I’ll stop him cold! Don’t
worry, I’ve been ready for this!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John! Oh, John, please listen to me! Please�I
can explain everything, John. I didn’t know what they were going to do!
Let me go with you, John! John, please!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go ahead, driver! Ball park!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John, please let me go with you! Please,
John!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Mr. Norton wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Listen to me, Mayor Lovett, you do as I say.
I want them both arrested. You tell the police department to pick up
Connell. I’ve got the girl here.</p>
<p><strong>hammett</strong>: I’ve got the Bulletin !</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I don’t care what you charge them with! If
you’re worried, let them go in the morning, but keep them in jail over
night!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Hello, Bulletin ? Put Pop Dwyer on.</p>
<p><strong>john doe convention</strong>: People come from all directions
and pour through the gates. Some carry umbrellas over their heads,
others have their coat collars turned up. Women hold newspapers over
their heads to protect their hats. It is a misty, drizzling rain.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Three cheers for John Doe!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen, ladies and gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>clergyman</strong>: Just a moment, John. We begin with a
short prayer.</p>
<p><strong>newsboys</strong>: Extry, extry! Read all about it!</p>
<p><strong>newsboys</strong>: Extry! John Doe a fake!</p>
<p><strong>newsboys</strong>: Here you are! John Doe a fake! Read all
about it! John Doe movement a racket!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Newsboys! Hundreds of yelling newsboys
are swarming into the park like locusts! They’re yelling, “John Doe’s a
fake! Fake!”</p>
<p><strong>newsboys</strong>: Here you are! No charge! John Doe a
fake!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: “Federal investigation urged by Chamber of
Commerce.”</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: How could he be a fake?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: It must be some kind of a gag.</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: A gag. A gag!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on, come on, step on it! Step on it! Step
on it! You all know your places now, so let’s get going! Wait for the
signal!</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Hey, mister, will you autograph my
balloon?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Gangway!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen! This is exactly what I
came down here to tell you about tonight. Please, if you’ll all just be
quiet for a few minutes I can explain this whole thing to you. As you
all know, this paper is published by a man by the name of D. B. Norton .
. .</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Don’t listen to that man! He’s a fake!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Stand back!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Wait a minute! Everybody wait a minute! Wait
a minute, ladies and gentlemen! My name is D. B. Norton . . . you all
know me! I accuse this man of being a faker! We’ve been taken for a lot
of suckers! And I’m the biggest of the lot!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: It’s not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff
into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers
there!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s a lie! Listen�don’t believe what he
says . . .</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Let go of me! This man had no intention of
jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so! Do you deny
that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s got nothing to do with it!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Were you paid for it�or weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes! I was paid! But the�</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: And what about the suicide note? You didn’t
write that, either!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What difference does that make?</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Did you write it�or didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I didn’t write it, but�</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Ah, you bet your life you didn’t! You look in
your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you’ll find Miss Mitchell’s
signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen, folks, it’s a fact that I didn’t write
the letter, but this whole thing started�</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: There! You see? He admits it! You’re a fake,
John Doe! And for what you’ve done to all these good people�they ought
to run you out of the country�and I hope they do it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Speak up, John! We believe you!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please listen, folks! Now that he’s through
shooting off his face, I’ve got a couple of things to tell you
about�</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on! The rest of you get in here and riot!
Break this crowd up! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: John Doe’s a fake! Boo! Boooooo!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: I’m sorry, folks, but we can’t hear him
any more. Something’s gone wrong with the loudspeaker.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Say, they can’t hear me! The thing’s not
working!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Sure, I believe you. Walking my legs off
digging up five thousand signatures for a phoney!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, there you are, Mr. Doe!</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: It makes no difference, Bert�the ideas’s
still good. We don’t have to give up our club.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah? Well, you can have it!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: They’re starting to throw things!</p>
<p><strong>2nd announcer</strong>: Somebody’s going to get hurt!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: I’m afraid it’ll be John Doe. Listen to
that mob!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I’ve got to go to him!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sorry, lady�I can’t let you out.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, let me go! Let me go to him! Oh, please,
please let me go! They’re crucifying him! I can help him!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sorry, sister. We got orders to hold
you.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Orders from who? Can’t they see it’s a
frameup?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Ann, darling!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, Mother! They won’t let me go! They won’t
let me go!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen, folks! You gotta listen to me,
everybody!</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Back to the jungle, you hobo!</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Just another racket!</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Stick to your clubs!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We’ve been fed baloney so long we’re getting
used to it!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The idea is still good! Believe me, folks! . .
.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You faker!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen . . . John Does . . . You’re the hope
of the world . . .</p>
<p><strong>john b. hughes</strong>: The police finally manage to get him
out of the park! If that boy isn’t hurt, it’ll be a miracle!</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, this
certainly looks like the end of the John Doe movement.</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Well, boys, you can chalk up another one to
the Pontius Pilates.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I should have been there. I could have helped
him. He was so all alone!</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: A lot of us are going to be mighty ashamed
of ourselves after tonight. We certainly didn’t give that man much of a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s voice</strong>: Have some more coffee, Long
John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, thanks, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Faker!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Racketeer!</p>
<p><strong>2nd voice</strong>: Liar!</p>
<p><strong>3rd voice</strong>: Cheat!</p>
<p><strong>4th voice</strong>: Imposter!</p>
<p><strong>5th voice</strong>: Why don’t you jump!</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Christmas Eve at midnight! Dissolve
to: Another shot: Of JOHN walking, his expression immobile. Over the
shot appear several scenes through which JOHN has lived:</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You’re a wonderful man, Mr. Doe.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. delaney</strong>: May God bless you, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Now, get in there and pitch!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: You’re a fake, John Doe, and I can prove it!
You’re the big hero that’s supposed to jump off tall buildings and
things. You remember? What do you suppose your precious John Does will
say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it�that
you were being paid to say so?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Christmas Eve at midnight?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Merry Christmas, sir.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Oh. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Who? John Doe? Is that screwball still
around?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Aw, that dame’s been callin’ all day.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: Sure, sure, I know. Yeah. At
midnight, huh? Okay, lady. We’ll have the place surrounded with
nets.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh�they’re laughing at me!</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s voice</strong>: You’re a sick girl, Ann. You’d
better take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Whom are you calling now? You called
that number not ten minutes ago!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Hello. Mr. Connell? Have you seen him yet? Have
you�</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: Now listen, Ann�he can’t possibly get in
without our seeing him. I’m watching the side door and the Colonel’s out
front, so stop worrying.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mitchell</strong>: Why, Ann! . . .</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Ann, don’t be foolish!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: If this isn’t the craziest, the battiest, the
looniest wild goose chase I ever heard of?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hansen</strong>: Oh, shut up. Bert. Sourpuss is
right.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Yeah? Well, if he is, I’m a banana split!</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: That man is gonna be on that roof. Don’t
ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Sure, sure. I’d like to believe in fairy
tales, but a guy that’s fake isn’t gonna jump off any roof.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hansen</strong>: I don’t think he was any fake�not with
that face. And, anyway, what he stood for wasn’t a fake.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Okay, honey, okay.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Elevators ain’t running.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Colonel!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You shouldn’t have gotten out of bed,
Miss.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Has he been here?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Have you seen him?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I ain’t seen him for a week.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Where’s Connell?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: He’s watching the other door.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh. Gee, you’re swell! Oh.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: No sense in going up there! I been here for
hours. He ain’t here!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, let me go, will you!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Now, that’s crazy. It’s fourteen
floors!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: This is as far as the elevator goes. We’ve
got to walk up to the tower.</p>
<p><strong>bennett</strong>: That tramp is probably full of Christmas
cheer and asleep in some flop house.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Let’s go. I’ve got to decorate my tree.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Well, I give up. I don’t know what gave us
the idea that he�he’d attempt anything like this.</p>
<p><strong>weston</strong>: I guess you’re right. I’m afraid the joke’s
on us. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I hope nobody finds out we’ve been here.</p>
<p><strong>“to john does everywhere”.</strong>: Close-up: Of JOHN. He
replaces the envelope in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: I wouldn’t do that if I were you, John.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: It’ll do you no good.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: The Mayor has policemen downstairs with
instructions to remove all marks of identification you may have on your
person. You’ll be buried in Potter’s Field and you will have
accomplished nothing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve taken care of that. I’ve already mailed a
copy of this letter to Mr. Connell.</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: John, why don’t you forget this
foolishness?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stop right where you are, Mr. Norton, if you
don’t want to go overboard with me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m glad you gentlemen are here. You’ve killed
the John Doe movement, all right, but you’re going to see it born all
over again. Now, take a good look, Mr. Norton.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, John, darling. No! No!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I won’t let you. I love you, darling.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John. Please, John, listen to me. We’ll start
all over again, just you and I. It isn’t too late. The John Doe movement
isn’t dead yet.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: See, John! It isn’t dead, or they wouldn’t be
here! It’s alive in them . They kept it alive. By being afraid of it.
That’s why they came up here.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, darling. Sure, it should have been killed
before. It was dishonest.</p>
<p><strong>ann’s voice</strong>: But we can start clean now. Just you
and I. It’ll grow again, John. It’ll grow big. And it’ll be strong,
because it’ll be honest!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, darling, if it’s worth dying for, it’s
worth living for. Oh, please, John . . .</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: Oh, please, God�help me!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: John, look at me. You want to be honest, don’t
you? Well, you don’t have to die to keep the John Doe idea alive!
Someone already died for that once! The first John Doe. And He’s kept
that idea alive for nearly two thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>ann’s voice</strong>: It was He who kept it alive in them
�and He’ll go on keeping it alive for ever and always! For every John
Doe movement these men kill, a new one will be born!</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: That’s why those bells are ringing, John!
They’re calling to us�not to give up�but to keep on fighting! To keep on
pitching! Oh, don’t you see, darling? This is no time to give up!</p>
<p><strong>d. b.</strong>: Med. shot: Toward ANN and JOHN. ANN’s
strength is slowly waning.</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: You and I, John, we can� No, John, if you die,
I want to die, too! Oh, I love you so�</p>
<p><strong>bert’s voice</strong>: Mr. Doe . . .</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You don’t have to�Why, we’re with you,
Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .</p>
<p><strong>bert’s wife</strong>: What Bert’s trying to say is�well�we
need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn’t believe what that man
said.</p>
<p><strong>wife’s voice</strong>: We were going to start up our John Doe
Club again whether we saw you or not.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Weren’t we, Bert?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: And there were a lot of others that were going
to do the same thing. Why, Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter from his
cousin in Toledo, and . . .</p>
<p><strong>sourpuss</strong>: Yeah, I got it right here, Mr. Doe!</p>
<p><strong>wife’s voice</strong>: Only�only it’ll be a lot easier with
you. Please�please come with us, Mr. Doe!</p>
<p><strong>bert’s group</strong>: Mr. Doe!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Long John!</p>
<p><strong>connell</strong>: There you are, Norton! The people! Try and
lick that! Come on, Colonel.</p>
