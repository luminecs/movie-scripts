<p><strong>ted</strong>: Good morning. Annie pretends to wake up.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wow, you look beautiful.</p>
<p>****: What? No. I don’t. Oh my God its the morning. I look terrible.
I just woke up.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Last night was fun.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, I had the best time. I have’t had that
much fun on a first date in years, ever… She brushes the hair off his
forehead as if he were her long time lover.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want to be
up front with you. I’m not really looking for a relationship right now.
Annie’s eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him, nodding.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I just want to be honest right off the bat.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that.
Annie struggles to maintain her composure.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m just so busy and I don’t have time for
another person…I…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, me too, I’m soo busy–</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And summer’s coming–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, summer, exactly. It’s a crazy season.
So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or–?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, I’m not gonna be in town much even in the
fall–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You shouldn’t be! Yeah, Halloween–</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m gonna be travelling a lot for work.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Me too, I’m just- so many business trips to
places that are just far away‘cause I’m doing really well at work.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And honestly, I don’t even know how I feel
about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone?
I mean, I like to be with a lot of different people.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that,
because isn’t that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? I mean,
i’s science. I’m-I don’t want a relationship either. Let’s just say
that. And I wouldn’t even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna
have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I’m just different
from other girls.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah. Well anyway, I really should get going. I
was gonna get a haircut today.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, they say that every couple months it’s
good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool.
’ve cut hair before. He waits, but Annie doesn’t budge.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, like I said I got stuff to do. Annie
notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, me too. Gonna try to get some sailing
in before the weather gets crazy…</p>
<p><strong>ted holly</strong>: Cool, well I don’t wanna be Get up the
jib.. late. Ted gets up. Awkward moment leading into…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, no problem. Made from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sometimes it sticks!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I love it! The gate starts to open. Annie
exits.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Byyyyee!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, shit. The brakes squeak as she very
slowly drives away.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s summer?! What the hell does that mean?
He can’t date anyone in the summer?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I guess? I don’t know. I feel so stupid
now.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: No he’s stupid Ann, not you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think I might be a little bit stupid.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ew. Did you have sex with him?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No! But I gave him a blow job.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, he kept putting it in my face.
Lillian’s boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his
sweats. He’s stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Well, at least he was honest with you so
you don’t waste your time with him.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at
all this sweat.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Can you see that I’m on the phone? I’m
talking to Annie.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Hey Annie.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for
women you know?</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Shit. Really?!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s not gonna do anything to you.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger. He
tries to rub up against Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ew, go take a shower. Dougie leaves.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: I’m gonna play with my new boobs in
there.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I swear I cannot handle him right now. He
has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it feels like I’m kissing my
brother. I don’t know what do. Annie pulls into an alleyway behind
HARRINGTO’S JEWELRY STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in
the car. A white blouse and navy skirt.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: At least you have someone. God, wha’s wrong
with me?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with you. But I think
maybe, and don’t get mad at me, I’ve said this to you before, you need
to stop trying so hard.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I still don’t think I do that.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: OK, so you had a first date last night. Did
you bring him a present? Annie is silent.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ann, what did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I brought him lemon-bars because I was making
them anyway, as a friend. Yo’re right, that’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: I just chipped a nail!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ok, I don’t know if it’s because I’m tired
or what, but I wanna kill him.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the
mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the
orthodontist. Lillian laughs.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh my God. We need to hang out. ’m coming
to Milwaukee this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: We’ll go to Joni’s and pig out and I’ll
bring some shitty magazines, and I’m gonna spend the night.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: God, I haven’t seen you in months!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye. They hang up.
Dougie is in the doorway wearing her nightie stretched over his
body.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Baby, I’m going through some changes…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You’re an idiot. We see she gets a kick out
of him.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi. Sorry, sorry! I’m here. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Annie! Thank God. OK people! Gather around me
please, in a tight semicircle. Annie and six other employees gather
around DONNA.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Something terrible has happened. Donald will
not be coming in to work today. He stepped on a wasp and there is some
uncomfortable swelling. Employees mumble.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Annie? Where’s your tie? Everyone looks at
Annie. She holds it up and starts to put it on.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Now, I have an eye doctor’s appointment that
I can’t change or they’ll will charge me. So someone will have to cover
for Donald in engagement rings. Now I– Annie and SANDY, a male
co-worker, shoot their hands the air eagerly.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Sandy? Today’s your day.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented
with an opportunity at work today. That is eerie. That is eerie.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Annie, that means you’ll be alone in
keepsakes. You think you can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Yeah, look out. There might be a bum- rush
for letter openers… The employees snicker.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sometimes there is, so….there have been. At
times, there has been.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Alright everybody, let’s get to work!
Saneel?!…OPEN SESAME! SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and
unlocks the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her things and
starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel
like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could
really-</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat
diamond in a standard English setting?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Five?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I just made all of that up. None of that was
real. I just put words together. You’re not ready for the big leagues.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s so hard to make commission over
there.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Sweetheart…did I ever tell you the story of
the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Many times.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in
her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she
stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. On his birthday!
My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here. He connects with the
customer. And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay. I do want it.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Good. Showing up on time is a wonderful place
to start. Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their own
backyard without at least a thin sandal. It’s reckless! Donna exits. A
customer passes Anni’s section.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello, can I interest you in a sterling
silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No?
We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. host</strong>: When Dave and Rhonda bought this house,
it was a medical clinic. I’ve never seen so many cupboards!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Noooo. That’s, that’s sooo smart. Annie
enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys down and sifts through
her mail. Steve presses mute.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter.
Did you make out? Sleep over? As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks
towards her room.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Don’t go in the bathroom. Are you going to
bed?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes. I’m beat.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what
you said and just threw it away.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door
behind her.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That credit lady called! She wants to talk to
you, Annie! She’s gonna find you. Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes
the T.V..</p>
<p><strong>allen</strong>: This is where they bagged the animals that
didn’t make it through the testing. We turned it into a cozy Moroccan
reading room.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Gross/Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re right. God, she’s getting really
skinny.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ann.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Your boyfriend just walked in.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: An orange-skinned BODY BUILDER with HUGE
arms and legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my God! Look, he showed up with your mom.
It’s a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking boots. They laugh to
themselves. Annie keeps reading.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Cool! They’re making a WKRP movie.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Here Annie, let me turn the page for
you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What? Lillian splays her hand over the
magazine showing off a sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I just want to help you turn the page of
your magazine for you…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lillian! What is that?!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m engaged.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?!!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: He proposed at dinner last night. I wanted
to tell you in person and show you this rock!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this
is…this is crazy!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I know Dougie and I have been fighting a
lot, but I’ve been so stressed out with</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s not I mean. I mean, I remember when we
met him at Lake Mills. You lost your virginity to him right in front of
me on the dock, remember?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh you want to get into who’s done what
down at the lake?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I don’t. It’s just making me realize how
long we’ve known each other.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Well then, who better to be my Maid of
Honor?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my God! I don’t know what to say!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie, you’re my best friend. Honestly I
didn’t even have to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God. I’ve
never been in a wedding.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s no big deal, and I don’t want to make
it one. It’s not gonna be a big crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple.
What dessert are you gonna get?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know what you’re doing. Don’t downplay
this. I’m happy for you. And someday when hell freezes over and I get
married, you can be my Maid of Honor. But for right now, this is about
you. OK? This is you’re day, and it is a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ok, but I still don’t want this to be a
huge production. I just want to have all my friends meet each other,
have fun, dance, drink, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Then that’s what it’ll be. Did you guys set a
date?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh God, not yet. I don’t want a super long
engagement, but there’s a lot to do.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well you are very fortunate because you
happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and–
Lillian’s cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Can you hold that thought. I’s my fiancee
calling. Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ooo, haha… Annie continues laughing alone.
She looks around the room as her smile disappears. She remembers…</p>
<p><strong>day.</strong>: Annie and Lillian at 7 years old standing
outside eating popsicles, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>young annie</strong>: Lillian Marie Donovan. Do you take your
husband, forever, to be your husband? Lillian stands by a poster of Eric
Estrada in his C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.</p>
<p><strong>young lillian</strong>: I do. Do you Annie Lucille Walker,
take your husband, forever? Reveal Annie standing next to a poster of
John Baker from Chips.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: And now we will leave on our honeymoon
to…</p>
<p><strong>sea world!!</strong>: The girls rip the posters off of the
trees. An old station wagon sits in the dirt driveway. They get in the
back seat, look straight ahead and just sit there.</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: thought.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: The madness has begun. Dougie’s parents are
having an engagement party for us next Friday.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Awesome!…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ooh, what’s this… She finds the article.
“Hurry, before he gets away! Top five ways to reel him in.”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me. A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden
retriever is reaching for a magazine. She can’t thing of what to say.
She remembers the magazine! It reads “#1. A simple, flirty</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: working! Her cell phone rings, she tries to
ignore it, but it keeps ringing…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie!?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes? It’s HELEN Lillian’s bridesmaid and
friend from the tennis Club. She’s a tall leggy blond, all smiles. East
coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere turtleneck sweaters in her
closet. She is sitting in a cream colored living room on a huge cream
couch with lots of candles glowing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hiiii! This is Helen. I’m one of Lillian’s
bridesmaids.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Of course, Helen. Hi!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Congratulations on being selected.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, thank you. Annie, reads “#2. Expose your
best asset. ASAP” She panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points
her toe, flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but politely
smiles and goes back to his magazine.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sorry, yes. Hi!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Maid of Honor!!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. It is quite an honor.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s the number one spot. So how many times
have you been in the B.P?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry, the what?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Bridal Party?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ve never even been in a wedding before.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What!? I’ve never even heard of that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Um, well, it should be fun. Annie sees that
the hot guy is leaving to pay for his magazine! She reads“#5. Make a
funny observational joke that pertains to HIM.</p>
<p><strong>� she</strong>: and the golden retriever meet eyes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Um Helen, can you hold on for a second?</p>
<p><strong>oh–</strong>: Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot
guy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey, you’re dog’s really cute.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh thanks.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s kinda funny right? That when girls are
ugly, they’re called dogs, but dogs are cute. Annie laughs. He half
smiles but does not respond.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, some dogs are ugly. Some girls are
ugly. I know a lot of ugly girls. But I’m not friends with them. I’ve
seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But some people I know who are considered
dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to
people cuz of that. And people who are not nice…that’s ugly to me. And
female dogs are called bitches, that’s weird. I’m just kidding. It’s a
joke. I have better ones. The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from
her phone.</p>
<p><strong>helen’s voice</strong>: Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I’m really excited for
all the wedding stuff and–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: YAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from Lilly
with all of the other girls’ information, and when you respond to any
wedding related e-mails from now on, just remember to hit “REPLY ALL”.
Did you know there are six of us?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, Lillian told me last night. Awkward
silence.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, can’t wait to meet you and hear what
your planning for the bachelorette. Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Not yet. But they are coming, and I will fill
you in–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oop! There goes my other line. See you
Friday! She realizes there might some research to do for this ‘bridal
party’ thing. She instead grabs two wedding magazines.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Just these. Noticing a magazine by the
register that reads ”</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And this.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Whoa. Email DING. She checks her inbox. 48
NEW MESSAGES. “Bridesmaids!”, “So excited to meet you!”, “Wedding
Bells!”,“Super fun!”,”Engagement party!” “Hotel Rates”,“Shoes”,“Shower

<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He probably didn’t see you, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, he saw me alright. He was married to me
for fourteen years, he knows what I look like. I’m sure it was because
BARB was there. You know how jealous she gets.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, I’m sure that’s it mom.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Am I on speaker phone?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know how to talk this way.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Mom I’m running a little late so–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, the engagement party. Lillia’s getting
married, I can’t believe how time flies. You’re day will come dear. Give
Lillian a kiss for me please, and tell Laurie and Ed I just could’t
afford the plane ticket, but I will be at the shower.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I already told them, they understand.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: BARB could afford to come. Did you know what
kind of car she drives now? A 2007 P.T. Cruiser. She looks ridiculous
parading all around Fort Myers in that thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok, Mom–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know how she gets in and out of that
little car with those big legs.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I should get going. I have long drive.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh and honey, I picked you up a couple of
things when I was at the Steinmart with Janice so look for a package in
the mail.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Mom I told you you don’t have to send me–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh stop. I love doing it. Ok? I love you
sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I love you too Mom. Bye. They hang up. Annie
walks to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok, how do I look?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ooooh. You tryin to hook up tonight? A lot of
people do at these wedding things you know so you have a good
chance.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nevermind…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I like the black tights with the black shoes,
it’s very elongating.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. Well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But I think you need more dark up top to
balance it out, do have any black beads?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: good idea. She starts to leave but sees a
guilty look and some frosting on Steve’s face. She looks over at her
saran- ’s.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How many moonpies have you eaten? Tell me the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Um……two.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok, now really tell me the truth. How many
did you eat?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Four. Nine. They stare at each other.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Shit! She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES
approaches, chewing gum.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Good afternoon ma’am, You in a hurry to get
out of the city?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. Was I speeding?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Is that even possible in this rig? He finds
this funny, Annie does’t.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You know funny thing about brake lights,
you’re supposed to have ’em.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah, and you’re headin’ up Witches Curve.
That’s a risky move.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry. I usually only drive in the city
and they’ve never pulled me over. To tell you the truth, those lights
have been out for like a year.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger. That is
not something you wanna go broadcasting to a police officer. I might
feel obligated to give you a yea’s worth of tickets now.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What? No.. I-</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You just admitted it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You admitted it. Yeah, I can’t do that
though.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Look, I’m really sorry. I promise I will get
the lights fixed tomorrow morning. I’m kind of in a hurry. I’m going to
my best friend’s engagement party, I’m the Maid of honor and so I really
-</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh, yeah. My little sister was just in a
wedding. She lost some of her hair from the stress. Again, not
funny.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Am I getting a ticket? He searches for words.
She’s cute and he wants to keep her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward
silence.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Uh, yeah. That’s what happens when you break
the law. Um…license and registration.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here. He writes a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Ooo, I like that air freshener. Did you get
that at the gas station?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Smells like Christmas. Yeah, it smells like
Christmas. He rips the ticket off.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Well, here you go. And just so you know it’s
a just a fix-it ticket. So if you get those lights repaired, you wo’t
have to pay anything.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Okay.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Whoa, are those moon-pies?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh, those are my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Nothing. Those are my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Do you want one?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: No. It’s too much trouble, they look all
wrapped up. She doesn’t get the hint. He really wants one.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Well, have fun at your party. Annie drives
off. He watches.</p>

embarrassed, hands her keys to the valet and grabs the moon-pies. She

<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie, sweetheart!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi Mrs. Donovan! They hug.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Oh! And you brought your famous moonpies!
Laurie takes the tray.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Can you believe our Lillian?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know, I’m so happy for her.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Well, clue me in. Is there anyone special in
your life?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: That’s my girl. Sleep around. I’m serious.
Travel the world and try all the cuisine you can. You know what I mean
by that, right? MARY, Laurie’s friend, approaches.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Laurie, where did you get that sweater? It is
one-hundred percent out-of-sight!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Shhh, I got it at Glory Gay’s.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Ooooh. I can’t even walk in there. The blouses
alone make my wallet open.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It’s worth it, though huh? Mary, I want you
to meet Lillian’s Maid of Honor.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, very special job.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: This is Annie Walker. She lived next door to
us in Milwaukee until the girls graduated from high school.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ann!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lil! It was nice meeting you Mary. Annie
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Her father ran off to Florida with a younger
woman who was working at a Chrysler dealership.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh my.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Poor Judy, never quite got over it. She also
ended up moving to Florida to take care of her parents.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, that is tough. Well it’s nice Annie and
Lillian have stayed friends.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: They’re like sisters.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey! What’s up? Where’s Dougie?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Smoking a cigar with my dad. Le’s go get a
drink. They weave towards the bar.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Annie!!!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Hold on Dougie, we’re getting drinks! They
get to the bar and grab glasses of wine.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: This place is so fancy. Dougie’s parents
belong here?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Yeah. So does Dougie. This is the tennis
club I’ve been playing at.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. Wow. I guess it’s not what I pictured.
Lucky you.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Tennis courts are tennis courts if you ask
me. But I have met a lot of really cool people here. I can’t wait for
you to meet the girls.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh! So where’s this guy you were telling me
about?</p>
<p><strong>lillian.</strong>: Oh shoot, Matt’s not coming. I guess he
got back together with his ex or something. Anyway, Dougie just told me.
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: There she is! Dougie picks Annie up and
swings her around.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Dougie, be careful. God, you reek! He puts
her down.</p>
<p><strong>dougie</strong>: Annie, make sure when my fiance gets cold
feet you tell her what a great guy I am. He grabs Lillian and kisses her
on the cheek.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ugh. Wash your face. She gives in and
kisses him. Then says to Annie..</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Come on. Let’s go say hi to the rest of the
bridal party. They approach LESLIE, Lillian’s cousin, late 30’s,
standing with her husband PAUL.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Leslie, hi! How are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Well, I just squeezed my third kid out last
month and I feel like I’m walking around in a fat suit. She swigs beer
out of a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I keep telling her she looks great. Oh, I’m
sorry. Is this your boyfriend? A 30 YEAR OLD AVERAGE GUY with a
neckbrace stands behind Annie. Paul goes to shake his hand. She stops
him.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, no. Hi. No. Annie meets DANA who is with
her husband Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie this is Dana, we met here in my
tennis class. Dana, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Hi! Dana Shig. Its so nice to finally meet you
Annie. I’ve heard so much about you. This is my husband Ernie. ERNIE has
just put food in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Don’t you just love weddings? I mean, I just
love like the feeling and…everyone comes together you know? And it’s
forever! It’s a journey, and WE get to go on it too!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow, that’s beautiful. I never thought of it
that way.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: This is all so amazing. I’m going to make a
scrap book for Lillian. Dana takes her camera out then reaches out her
hand.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Hi. I’m Dana and this is my husband Ernie.
So…how did you two meet? She refers to a bald man who looks like a
chemistry teacher, who is slowly walking by looking for someone.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I don’t know him. He’s not with me. He’s
just passing by. I’m not here with anyone. BECCA stands very close to
her husband KEVIN, a good looking stockbroker type.</p>

<p><strong>becca</strong>: Hi Annie! I’m Becca. I’ve heard so much about
you. This is my husband Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Dougie’s partner.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: So, are you so excited?! All of this reminds
me so much of my wedding.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Two months now! It was the best day of my
life. I’m married now! It’s like…I’m just better now! It might sound
weird but… I feel legit. Just like, feminine. Look at my nails! Two

standing next to Annie. He is wearing an ascot and smoking a pipe.</p>

Dougie’s sister. An ODDBALL. She looks like she might be at the wrong
party. She is single and lovin’ it!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie! Hey! What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Megan! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I just got pins in my leg! I fell off a
cruise ship.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Yeah. I was on a singles cruise. It was
nighttime.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I was port-side, having a drink with a
gentlemen and old Megan here decided to show off and I tried to climb
into one of the lifeboats with my clogs on. I saw a dolphin.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow. Well, I’m glad you’re OK.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Listen Annie. You’re single right? You and I
are gonna scam on guys this whole time. You and I are gonna party and
get naked with guys. This whole time Annie, no bailing. Lillian
re-appears, grabs Annie.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ann, there you are!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Think about what I said Annie!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m saving you. Now I really want to
introduce you to Helen. looking There she is. In slow motion, a tall and
gorgeous HELEN turns to us. She wears a tight, cream-colored,
floor-length evening gown. Annie straightens her plastic beads.</p>

<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hiii.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hiii. This is my husband Perry.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Perry owns Atmospheria candles.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, the Starbuck’s of the candle world? Those

<p><strong>helen</strong>: All of them. It’s the family business, his
father started it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, wow, that’s pretty cule.</p>

<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>living room - moments later.</strong>: Groomsman DEAN
finishes a speech. They are now in the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: So cheers to you two, our last single friends
finally crossing over into the world of marital bliss, welcome to the
other side! Dana snaps a photo, crying. Helen approaches the podium.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris the
Third, an honored member of the bridal party. In honor of Lillian and
Dougie, I’d like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned
last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in
Santorini. Annie whispers to the person next to her.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen
reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe. Dana starts
to cry. She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a
lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every…scent of a woman, every breath
you take, every move you make. Love conquers all. Annie sees that
Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They say when you choose a mate, yo’re
choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo’re a lucky man. Lillian, I know
you’re going to make a wonderful wife, because you have been the best
friend that I could ever ask for. Annie’s face goes blank.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I have never had a friendship like this. I’m
so happy you two are finally taking this big step together and I ca’t
wait for all of the adventures that await us. People are moved,
sniffling. Including Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now “Dougly”, sorry, inside joke. You better
not keep my Lil on a leash. I still need my drunken nights at Rockin
Sushi! TO DOUGIE AND LILLIAN!!! The crowd erupts with laughter and
applause. People are crying, hugging, and standing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Thank you. Thank you! Now wher’s Annie?
Annie? Stand up Annie. The room looks around. Annie slowly rises.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There she is. Annie is our Maid of Honor
everyone. And I’m sure she’d like to take this time to say a few words.
Annie? Annie stands up to the applause. The room falls silent as she
walks to the podium.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. ’m Annie.
Wow, it really smells like vanilla in here.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It’s the candles Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be
awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what’s that saying?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ayay, um, God, um, what is it? It’s a good
one, a good saying, it’s Irish. It’s like a-like a toast. Is it Irish?
Something about a road…Oh God, ’m blanking. So I’ll just say I’m so
happy to be a part of this whole celebration and happiness. You two are
so happy together and hope you have a happy lifetime of happiness and
celebrating. And I love you and….Lillian, w’ve been best friends since
we were like 5…’ve never been to Greece… ’t know if she’s done. Annie
sees Helen has moved over to sit next to Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: “Did you ever know that you’re my hero…You’re
everything I wish I could be..” C’mon you guys know the words. Some
people reluctantly sing along.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: “I could fly higher then an eagle. For you
are the wind beneath my wings. Flyyy, flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so
fly until we touch up high–”</p>
<p><strong>ext-country club. later.</strong>: Lillian and Annie are at
the valet.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my God, tell me I didn’t sing.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: No, you sang. They both laugh.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: God, I don’t know, I was just maybe a little
out of my element, and after Helen’s speech–</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ann, stop.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m so embarrassed. What did you think of
your engagement party?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Besides the impromptu concert from Bette
Midler, it was perfect. They laugh and hug.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I gotta go say bye to some people I do’t
know. Drive safe. Lillian goes back inside. Helen appears out of thin
air.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie! Great job tonight..</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m feeling slightly mortified.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a
little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen,
’ve been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian’s shower. I was
thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets…are you
ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Aren’t I supposed to be planning some of
these things?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, well, I hadn’t heard from you and–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: She just got engaged two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, I figured since you don’t have any
experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Helen, I’m pretty capable. I think I can
handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen.</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You
have beautiful cursive.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie
and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie, I didn’t mean I didn’t think you
couldn’t do it. I’m sure you are aware of all your duties. We’ll
see–we’ll see you soon. Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie! Megan is running towards her with a
piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie wait! I wanna give you my numbers. A
place just opened up near my house. From 4-7 every weekday, Karaoke, two
dollar wings and all you can eat MAN sandwiches if you know what I mean.
Annie is nervous, starts biting her nails.</p>
<p><strong>nail technician</strong>: Your nail too short for french
manicure.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh well…</p>
<p><strong>nail technician</strong>: That’s Ok. I fix for you. Make you
sexy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, great!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: And then they put a solution in my eyes to
dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my
sight, my hearing became bionic. Do you need some help dear? Annie
struggles to open a bag of chips but her new ULTRA LONG,
french-manicured nail-tips are making it very hard.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>donna’s office. continuous</strong>: Annie and Donna are
doing inventory. Annie gets text.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sorry… Well, it’s official. Lillian set a
date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Don’t be nervous. It’s not all on your
shoulders. Doesnt she have other bridesmaids?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah and they’ve all done this before so I’m
feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for
Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I wish I could help. Weddings are a lot
different now then they were in my day. They look at Donna’s wedding
picture on her desk.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That dress is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I still have it. I was hoping my daughter
Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their “ceremony” they
both wanted to wear suits. Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets.
Annie struggles to write with her nails.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: They’re very long.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi. I need to make these shorter.</p>
<p><strong>nail technician</strong>: No, not sexy!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know, it’s… I can’t work with them so
long.</p>
<p><strong>nail technician</strong>: Okay. 7 dollar for file. No more
sexy though.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>nail technician</strong>: Short nail is ugly.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here it is!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ooh, Occasionz. I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it’s
you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that’s cool. Oh and
also, there’s a restaurant inside, so um, I figured, we could maybe have
lunch after. So, let’s go! She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees
a buzzer.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I didn’t see that. She presses the
buzzer.</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi, we’re hear to see some bridesmaids
dresses.</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: What’s the reservation name?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, she must be talking about the restaurant.
No, we’re here to look at dresses.</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: I heard you the first time. So I
take it you don’t have a reservation for the dress shop?</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: You didn’t make a reservation?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Um, no, I’m sorry, I didn’t know I had to
make a reservation for that. Sorry! Anyway, we’re all out here now
and–</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: The next available appointment
for bridesmaid fittings is in seven weeks and we don’t take reservations
over the intercom so you’ll have to call.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Seven weeks?!</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: I’m sorry maybe you can’t hear
me. I just said a few seconds ago that we do’t have a reservation for
the next seven weeks.</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: And when you make your
reservation do’t forget you’ll also need to make an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: You didn’t make an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for
you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here
and I didn’t know about the reservation/ appointment thing so…</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie, we can go somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, no. I’ll work it out. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: This really is the best place though, that’s
the thing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Listen, I know the–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes, hello!</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: We can fit you in seven weeks, that is all
we have available. We only take parties that have a reservation and that
have made an appointment over the phone. I’m going to ask you to not
buzz in again. Thank you. Byyyyyyye. Helen approaches the intercom.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Whitney?</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Yes? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Whit, it’s Helen.</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Helen?! Hiiii!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hiiii!</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi! Listen, I’m out here with a whole bunch
of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation-
appointment wasn’t made. Is there any way to fit us in?</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Say no more. Buzzzzzzzz. The girls happily
enter.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ann, don’t worry about it. We got in. Annie
sees racks of wedding dresses.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the
wedding dresses?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh my God. Annie, I didn’t tell you? Guess
who Helen is friends with? Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: That famous wedding dress designer tha’s in
all those wedding magazines? As a favor to Helen she’s going to design
my dress for almost nothing. Normally they’re like twenty grand. She’s
French.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow. That’s amazing.</p>
<p>****: I have to send my measurements to France. Annie is a little
disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Surprise, surprise. It’s my Mom. Mom? Can
you hold on a second? She covers the phone and talks to the girls.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Start looking at dresses. I’ll be right
back. I think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something
you like since you’re the ones wearing it. Cool? Have fun! What’s up
Mom? Ugh! They’re booked? Lillian leaves talking to her Mom.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ok ladies, start your engines! Shots of
dresses being pulled off of the racks. Fighting for the same dress,
shirts coming off, dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting,
etc.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi I’m Annie. Can I get a martini? What you
mean you need to see I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>fantasy. upscale party. like an overdramatic perfume
ad.</strong>: Annie, in the dress, is talking to the bartender.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Well, with that dress on you look about…
.eleven.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thank you. Annie laughs. And turns away right
into, a GORGEOUS male model in a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>hot man in tux</strong>: Excuse me, you dropped an earring.
An UNDERWEAR MODEL appears, in his underwear.</p>
<p><strong>underwear model</strong>: I’ll get it for her.</p>
<p><strong>man in surgeons scrubs</strong>: No I will!</p>
<p><strong>man in red bathing suit</strong>: I’ll get it! I’m a
lifeguard. Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her. The chaos
forces Annie to make a DRAMATIC EXIT from the CASTLE. She runs down the
stairs like Cinderella into the forest. They men begin to chase her. She
runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to face with a sexy,
sweaty, lumberjack, wh’s chopping wood. It’s CHRISTIAN BALE.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>christian bale</strong>: Hi. I’m Christian Bale. I’m just
chopping some wood, I like to do that between movies.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the
men from the party screaming for her.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Christian! I need a place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>christian bale</strong>: Quick, get inside my muscles. They
embrace.</p>
<p><strong>christian bale</strong>: I love this sash. They look into
each others’ eyes, just about to kiss and–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi Annie!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh, is
that the dress you like?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody,
it has a sash–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: A sash? Annie, this isn’t the Sound of Music
tryouts.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I told you Becca I can’t wear strapless!</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Why not?! Annie and Helen come out to see all
the bridesmaids arguing.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Because, I–</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Why don’t you two shut your traps? No one’s
going to be looking at us. Le’s just get the one with the shawl, ’m
always freezing at these things anyway.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I gotta say I’m still leaning towards the one
that I found. It is a very ugly.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, what about this one? Everybody stops
and looks at Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think it would be flattering on everyone
and we could totally wear it again. The sash comes in different colors
not just this one.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Everyone! We can’t all have the dress that we
want. I’ve been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid
dress, you must ask yourself, “If invited, would I wear this a dress
to…The ACADEMY AWARDS!”</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Ooo, I never thought of it that way. All the
girls agree.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: With that in mind, I say we wear this one.
Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Or this one! People wear sashes to the
Academy Awards all the time.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Only if they’re nominated for the Sound of
Music.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think Lillian would like this one.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, I think Lillian would like THIS one.
Lillian walks in.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Hey! I’m hearing lots of excitement in
here. She touches Helen’s dress.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oooo, I like this one. What about you
guys?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I love it. Right guys? The girls all agree.
Except Annie.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Cool. Let’s eat! Helen dumps the dress in
Annie’s arms and follows Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think it might look best in cream.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ooh, good idea. They exit.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Well, that was easy. The girls head back to
change.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: This dress is almost $500!</p>
<p><strong>dana/becca</strong>: That’s not too bad/that sounds about
right.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, that’s what I’m saying. That’s a great
price.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: This place is kind of amazing. I did’t even
know it existed.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: The southwestern cobb is really good. I come
here and eat sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Great, there’s a fly that really likes
me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: They only have salads.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: So Annie, what’s your deal? Are you dating
anyone?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend for
three years but we broke up like six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It just didn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money
from you and gave you an STD? Everyone freezes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Lillian told me. Annie shoots Lillian a
look.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m sorry, I was just talking about you
cause I was worried about you and–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No it’s fine. But he didn’t steal the money,
I loaned it to him. And HPV is really common right now. Everyone looks
around.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Around fifty percent of sexually active men
and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives and by age fifty,
eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital HPV
infection.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect
Americans each year.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Ew, it’s on the butter you guys. The fly’s on
the butter.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Very few HPV infections show any signs or
symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected people don’t even know they have
it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner. Silent.
Everyone is a little grossed out..</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Anyway, it’s fine, the past is the past. We
weren’t meant to be. My last pap-smear came back normal so that’s cule.
But you know, I’m dating, here and there…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the
wedding?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I didn’t even think about that.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Who needs a date? Just go stag and make out
with someone there.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you
should come to karaoke night at my church. We sing hymns to rock
beats!</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Wait. I have the perfect guy for you Annie.
Mike Donahue. He went to school with Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Mike from the fourth of July last year?
Ooh, I’ve seen him Ann. He’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: And Kevin said he just sold his company for
an embarrassing amount of money. But he’s totally down to earth. You
guys have to meet. I’m texting Kevin right now.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly
out of the butter.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: The fly just committed suicide. Death by
butter.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could
live out here and see us all the time!</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit
around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a
wet paper towel.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oooh, I didn’t know we were going to hear
that word at lunch today.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I was set up with Ernie. As soon as I met him,
I knew.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Yeah Annie, you never know.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer
Rhodes approaches.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Well, look who it is.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh hi.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I see your still driving around with busted
tail lights.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry, money’s been tight and…I forgot.
You’re not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Nah… The reason I pulled you over today, is
that– you were driving too slow. Backing up traffic.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I was?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yep. You were going ten miles under the
speed limit. That’s a moving violation. It’s…underdriving. It’s in the
books. But, I’m just going to give you a warning this time, but I do
have to um…write some stuff down on a piece of paper. He begins to
write. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Man I’m hungry. I’m doing the Master
Cleanse. You ever heard of it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Cayenne pepper water for three days now.
It’s supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It’s working. The
only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You
ever crave that kind of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t talk about cravings right now. I am
PMS’ing like crazy. It’s taking everything in me not to stop and the
store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I’m so irritable
right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: No, it’s OK, I’ve got three sisters. We had
tampons in the pencil drawer. Sometimes my friends and I would say they
were cigars and smoke’em. Okay. I have finished writing down the things
I need to write, on this paper. OH! He hands her a business card.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: This is a buddy of mine. Owns a body shop in
Milwaukee. Might be able to help you out for a good price with those
taillights. I’ll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred
you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: That’s my name right there. In case you
forgot it from last time. It’s Nathan Rhodes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks. Annie. I’ll get those fixed. I get
paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more
suave.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Trust me, I’ve been in the jewelry business
for a long time. Nothing says “I’m sorry for your loss’ like a sterling
silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We also have yo-yos you can engrave. In
memory of…um, what’s your friend’s name? The old woman walks away as
Sandy approaches.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Paychecks. Here you go Annie. She and Sandy
open their checks.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Oh my God, I scored this week. ’m gonna buy
Sharita a new Panasonic telephone. It’s cordless and has intercom. What
about you Annie?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that
I’ll never wear again.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Help me! I can’t find anything to wear for my
date with Mike tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I don’t know. Shoot, I can’t talk now. I’m
with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean
St. Petsois JuJu about my dress. Ugh. I’m so sorry. She’s calling! I
gotta go. Have fun! Lillian hangs up. Steve walks in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That credit lady called you again. I told her
you were at the tailors.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Listen, I’m going on a date. This? or
this?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t like those pants.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s wrong with’em?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They give you four corners. Annie’s not
following.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s when a girls butt looks like it has four
corners. It’s not a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Shit. These are my only clean pants.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do you have a tube skirt?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Wait. If you stand like you are right now
facing that angle, it looks good. She looks in the mirror again, grabs
her bag and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m not an expert in corporate real- estate
but I’ve always been interested in it. So, yeah I totally agree. Mike
smiles, he is cute!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I have to admit, I told Becca ’m not really
keen on set-ups. I know i’s early, but so far so good.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: And thanks again for coming from Milwaukee, I
know it’s quite a drive.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I can do that drive in my sleep these
days.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Next time maybe I’ll come to you. Annie
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You have got great teeth.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thank you. I brush’em every day. She flashes
her teeth. The hostess comes up.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Your tables ready.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Finally! Mike guzzles down his cocktail as
they read their menus.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, I don’t know about you but since we’re
at a Thai restaurant, I’m gonna try the dog. Mike laughs at his own joke
and continues drinking.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: So, Becca tells me you play a lot of
tennis.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I try to squeeze in a game now and then. We
should play sometime.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah I haven’t rea–</p>
<p>****: Yeah, my game’s pretty solid. I did win a couple tournaments at
the club. I tend to- Jesus Christ! It smells like B.O. in here huh? I
think it’s the people. A very effeminate waiter brings them their
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Here ya go. I’ll be back to take your order
in two secs. I’m swamped!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Whoa, get a load of our waiter. ’m surprised
he didn’t put pink umbrellas in our drinks… Annie laughs, but is a
little uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Or AIDS. Mike laughs. Annie is HORRIFIED. Mike
swigs from his drink.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Seriously, AIDS is crazy. You do’t have it do
you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Neither do I… He raises his eyebrows up and
down at her.</p>
<p><strong>later.</strong>: Annie hasn’t touched her food. He’s eating
with his hands and drunk. Other patrons are beginning to stare.</p>
<p>****: So I started to get a little chub, you know what that is. How
could I not with those huge canteloupes waving in my face. Anyway, I
looovee massages, am I right? As he’s laughing he lets out a huge
burp.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Whoa-ho! Excyuuuuse me! I got that from Steve
Martin. Still laughing, he pats his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh shit. I forgot my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey, it’s me, I just had to tell you about my
night. Oh my God. Call me.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car out
there.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Very funny, Officer…Jones?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he was
a little more memorable than he was.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. Sorry. I’m a little out of it. I’m not
drunk.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: That’s ok. Call me Rhodes. Trying to get
“calm”?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. Recovering from a date.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Finish your cleanse?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the
really bad foods I like eating.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks for the drink. So are you one of those
cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: A lot of people get up to high speeds on
this road. I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your
family pay for a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s a very good point.</p>
<p><strong>officer rhodes</strong>: Want a carrot?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes. I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>continuous:</strong>: They are leaning on the back of his car
eating carrots.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry,
warped discolored carrot.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh, you got the ugly carrot.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: There’s one in every bag. You should eat
it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. I think you should eat it. The’re your
carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, no! Don’t eat it! EW!!! She throws it on
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Don’t litter. He picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to get of out
a restaurant faster in my life.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah, I don’t go on blind dates. It seems
unnatural.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I have no idea what am I going to tell my
friends who set us up.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Just tell her the truth.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. You’re probably right. Now Rhodes and
Annie are driving in his police car.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s an ok job. It’s commission, so it’s
unpredictable. I don’t know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor’s but
that’s kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I’d feel like
ninety around all those college students.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You know my dad used to say that life is
like a hallway of doors. You can stand at the same door forever if you
want. Or you can open a different door. And that one may not be the
right door, but i’ll open up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway, it
worked for me. I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I
knew I was a cop. And I love my job.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hmm. I think I get it?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side
of the road.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Moonpies. What?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: It’s a joke. You had moon-pies in your car
the first time I pulled you over.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>officer rhodes</strong>: When I get married I don’t want the
kind of wedding people have these days. I want it to be like a carnival.
You know dunk tanks? People win prizes…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze
artists and a big scale to guess the bride’s weight.</p>
<p><strong>officer rhodes</strong>: Ok, first of all that’s a circus
wedding and I’m talking about a carnival wedding.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sorry. Yeah I’ll have the number four, and
can you make that Super Biggie?</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: They are sitting in the restaurant,
mouths full of</p>
<p><strong>officer rhodes</strong>: And then she moved to Hawaii and now
lives with a guy who sells shaved ice. And supposedly she has really
long armpit hair now. That’s pretty much the last girlfriend I had.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I
lived with broke up with me over the phone. Then come to find out, he
had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in
horrible debt that I’m still paying off. Because I can’t find him.</p>
<p><strong>officer rhodes</strong>: Wow. You win.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s car. continuous.</strong>: Annie in her car, engine
running.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my gosh. It’s twelve thirty! I should
probably…</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh, before you go. There is something I want
to give you. I was gonna wait but, I think you’ll want this now. He
jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: For me?!</p>
<p><strong>officer rhodes</strong>: Well I know you’ve had a terrible
night. He gives it to her. Her phone rings.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my gosh!
No,no. Can you hold on a sec? She waves at Rhodes and mouths…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I guess I’ll see you around?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah. Don’t forget about those taillights.
They’re really starting to bug me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: K. Bye. So, you’re in town?</p>
<p><strong>ext - ted’s house. next morning.</strong>: He opens the front
door, leading Annie out again.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Next time I won’t call so late.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I was
just driving.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Awesome. It’s cool that we can just hookup and
whatever. No strings.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Cool. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit card
at the restaurant! Shit! She picks up her phone and dials.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi, Donna, it’s Annie. Um, sorry but I just
ran out of gas and I’m gonna be a little bit late. Yes, I know, ’m
really sorry. I will get there as soon as I can. I promise, I’m so
sor—hello?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said that
you were coming and that you were late. Helen is standing there looking
gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I had to come into Milwaukee for a charity
luncheon right down the street and I thought I’d come in and say hi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I
thought it’d be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn’t that
technically be me? Honor?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, no, sweetie, you’re the Maid of Honor,
and we’re all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, I’m the leader. Anyway,
it doesn’t matter. Um, I wanted to get something that we could wear to
the rehearsal dinner or something. That would be fun. Where are the
diamonds?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a
tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? No? Ok, let me get
Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh! And Annie we really need to start
planning the bachelorette.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes. Yes. I’m on it. Got some ideas. So I’ll
let you know.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: Wow, well I have never seen a
transformation like this. This old tour bus is stunning.</p>
<p><strong>girl on show</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Unbelievable. You got another package from
your mom.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I
said I’ll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And
pulls out a red blazer.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No problem. But you should always put gas in
when it gets to a quarter tank. Especially cause you have such a shitty
car.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you
think of Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a black
hole but I must have it in my life. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m just asking because some of the girls are
talking about going for Lillia’s bachelorette party and I’ve never
been.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh no. Now I don’t know about weddings. When
you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay
for the bride.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ok, I’m gonna say no. You cannot afford that.
Vegas is not cheap. Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show
tickets. Remember this morning? You cannot afford Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I could save up for it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, you need to win a contest to go to
Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday. Ooh, “Night Moves.” Can I have
this? A lightbulb goes off in Annie’s head. Steve holds the blazer out
and reads the tag.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Told you I’d pay you back! Annie runs into
her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We
see these words: “Dear bridal party”, “great idea”, “bachelorette
party”, “Florida”, “Sea World!”, “Free place to stay!”. She presses
send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately rings.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hiiiii.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a
cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing
candles. There are too many flames.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I just got your e-mail. Um…Sea World?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well it’s not just Sea World. It’s a weekend
in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she
loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it
would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad’s house, he
won’t even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach
and then Sea World on one of the days.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But a bachelorette at Sea World?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Like I said, Sea World would just be a part
of it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, I have been talking to the other girls,
and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie’s other line
rings.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, can you hold on? That’s my other line.
She clicks over.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Hi, Annie. It’s Becca. Becca, in her
shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says “The
Whitman’s”</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: I was just looking at your e-mail, yo’re so
cute. Sea World. What about Turkey? That’s where we went for for MY
bachelorette.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh well, Turkey’s really far away.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: It’s super old though! They have awesome
restaurants. It’s very exotic. Have you ever seen Aladdin? It totally
looks like that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hang on… Annie clicks back over to Helen.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Helen, I’m sorry can I call you back?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Just a few minutes. I’ll call you back. Annie
clicks over.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Becca?</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place
closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Everybody always goes to
Vegas. It seems just cliche to me.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: I never get sick of it. I love blackjack. I
have a system. Annie’s other line.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, my other line’s ringing. Can I call you
back?</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Soon. Annie clicks over.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Annie, it’s Dana!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Of course it is.. Dana is on her porch swing
drinking lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I love your idea about Sea World.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Yeah, but then Helen just called me and said
we should go to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: But Vegas is so hot, don’t you think? It’s
like, hot and dry. People get sick there all the time.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I haven’t had that experience. My skin always
clears up there.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, I just think it’s probably not– Hold
on. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie, it’s Megan. Megan is at work, in front
of a wall of computer and television screens. It is a technical haven,
looks like</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I can’t talk right now, but I was thinking
for the bachelorette, something more along the lines of a personal
challenge weekend. Have you ever heard of the Nevada Project?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. Leslie in her Sopranos style living room
on a treadmill. Her kids run around.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: I gotta be honest. I’ve been married for
nine years, this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and I
want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the face at some
point during this trip. I’ll pay whatever I have to pay. Tyler stop it,
put that back! Paul!</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Vegas has these party busses that have flat
screens in them and dance floors–</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Or we could take hummer limos around
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That sounds really expensive.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh but it’s gonna be so much fun! Besides
money shouldn’t be a problem if Lillian’s our friend.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh no, no, I was just thinking about everyone
else. That’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: What I’m saying is, they drop you off in the
middle of the desert. You have to kill your own food and find your way
back. Not everyone makes it. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Seriously. I want balls in my face.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: So I think Vegas is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I agree with Helen. Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Oh, you know what else is in Nevada?
Vegas!</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Balls. Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Vegas it is.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Holy Shit Annie! We’re goin’ to Vegas!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: No can do, I need all my shifts. ’m trying to
save up and take my lady to Maui.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Please, one day a week, just for a little
while. I’ve already asked everybody else. I really need the money.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Sorry. My hands are tied. Sharita’s got my
dick in a chip-clip.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s alright. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Mmm. Mm. These are the best peanut butter
titties you ever made.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: They’re called peanut butter kisses.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: That’s not what they look like.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Here we are. The city of lust. Annie, do you
know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now? We are
gonna nail it down. We should tell everybody we’re twins cause guys
looking up with twins!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, I’ve heard that. Ok everybody! You
guys, hey we’re here, we’re in Vegas! Woo! Lillian walks up.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie, come here. Why didn’t you tell me
you weren’t sitting with us?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, it’s no big deal. I didn’t want to blow
all my money on a first class ticket. I’m here though, right?!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m so excited!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to
Lillian’s bachelorette party! We should probably get a bunch of cabs and
head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites… As Annie’s
talking, a limo pulls up behind her. “The New Marquis Royal Suites.”</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Lillian, look what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh my God. You guys, is this for us?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I got a limo from the hotel. We’re in Vegas!
Yaaaay!! They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a ride
to the hotel. It’s taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Sit by me, Annie!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: This hotel is amazing! You guys!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come on Lillian, you’re staying with me in
the master suite. It’s all set.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh! Okay! Then party in room 812 in one
hour!</p>
<p><strong>upstairs. hotel hallway. continuous.</strong>: Girls get off
the elevator, giddy with excitement. Annie gets back into the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses downstairs.
Ugh! Where’s my head?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi, I have a reservation for Walker. RICK, an
East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of
himself, posed exactly as he is now, with the same outfit. He holds the
pose, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Okay, two nights?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes. Rick waits for her to notice the
painting, but she never does.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Do you want towels?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Do you need sheets?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No pillow though, ok? Annie just stares at
him.</p>
<p><strong>helen and lillian</strong>: OH MY GOD!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Oh my gosh, I can’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: He-llo Vegas!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello cat.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Oooh, Annie’s here!</p>
<p><strong>bridesmaids</strong>: Wooooooh!</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Isn’t this amazing? Lillian runs over and
hugs Annie, wearing a condom veil and drinking out of a penis straw.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie! I wanna see a drink in your hand in
one minute! Lillian pulls Annie into the room. Helen is getting off of
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ok you guys, change of plans. The Velour
Cobra had an opening at 9 so I got us a dinner reservation. Isn’t that
radical?</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Woohooo/Ooooh/Alright!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. Yeah. Cool. Alright Everyone raises their
glasses. The night has begun.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay, mine was…great, got it. Becca scoots in
next to her.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Annie, I didn’t get a chance to ask you, how
was your date with Mike? Give me all the details.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, um, we had dinner.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Do you think you’ll go out with him again? He
told Kevin he thought you were really great and hot.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Hey wha’s the damage down there?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I got it right here, I figured out what I
owe so, should I just pass it around?</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Why don’t we just all split it? It’s so much
easier.</p>
<p><strong>becca,dana,helen,megan</strong>: Yeah/Just split it/Who
cares?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, it’s probably just easier…just split
it.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Here, let me see it. Ok.. .It’s a hundred
each plus tip.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I had soup and ice water.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Plus we’re paying for Lillian…everyone just
put $125.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No alcohol…or any real food.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: It’ll all even out by the end of the
night.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How does it even out? How does that happen?
Everyone, including Annie, puts in their money. Helen moves over to
Annie.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Thank you everybody!!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie, don’t tell Lillian, it’s a
surprise.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: My friend Sean Michael works for a
promotional company and they’re having this big event tonight at Tara
Rei’s stepbrother’s Club, Sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think it should be our first stop. H’s
reserving seats for us in the VIP section. It’s a $150 cover and there’s
a one bottle champagne minimum of $750 per table, he said people from
the Real World go in there all the time.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I thought we were going to the Jungle Lounge
after this.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We are. After that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh…um…wow. Awesome. Here’s the thing I was
going to stop by the hotel, the Marquis Suites. I think I ate something
weird on the plane probably, my stomac’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, well we’re only gonna be there for an
hour or so, you can just meet up with us after.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ll just text you when we’re getting ready

tipsy.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ok, Leslie spilled the beans. Le’s get our
asses over to Sacrifice. What are we waiting for? Wooooooo! Lillian
looks at Helen’s legs.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Whoa whoa. Helen, turn around. Are those
those Ransom Jeans?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t tell Perry I bought them,I ordered them
from New York. They’re insanely expensive. But I gotta tell you guys the
compliments I get on my ass make them worth every penny. She sticks her
butt out. Lillian slaps it and all the girls laugh. She is the life of
the party.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh my God, Annie our song! Wher’s

<p><strong>guys</strong>: Yeah, she’s back/ the Roller!/ Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What happened to you?</p>

<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ll have two lemon drops.</p>
<p><strong>int bar. half hour later.</strong>: Annie and Dave are
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s what I’m saying. Some people have
everything and others have just little bits of things. It’s not fair. I
don’t get it…..I mean I think I hate Helen.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I hate Helen.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That is the sexiest think anyon’s ever
said.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: I hate Helen.</p>
<p><strong>next morning. annie’s hotel room</strong>: The cat jumps on
the bed and meows. Annie opens her eyes to see Dave sleeping. She
notices his college tattoo on his arm .</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were making
out. I guess I was pretty tired.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey.</p>

I tried calling you fifty fucking times. And YOU? You were what, hooking
up with this fossil?!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: First of all-</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Shut the fuck up or I will kick your ass
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok, that is not nice.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: And what are you forty?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I’m in my low thirties… and you could
never kick my ass.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What did you say?!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You heard me. Annie immediately gets punched
in the face. Annie is shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the
face. She’s proud of herself. Nicole’s two friends enter and jump on
Annie. HUGE GIRL FIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Baker Community College bitch!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Whoa. What are you, going to a rodeo?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie, you missed it. I scammed all night
last night. I met this guy named Darwin. He works for Cingular. He had a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: What happened to your face?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Yeah, why are you wearing all that
makeup?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s covering up bruises, cuts and a hickey.
I got into fight with a community college student and her friends
because I spent the night with her boyfriend after spending the entire
night trying to find you.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I was trying to find YOU. I tried to call
you all night!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I- minute? Annie takes Lillian
away.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What is going on? You told Helen you were
sick.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I wasn’t sick. Helen told you that because… I
couldn’t afford to go with you guys.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Why didn’t you say something?–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Lillian, we’re going to be late for our honey
facials.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Helen, can you just give us a minute?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m just saying, we’re gonna be late. I don’t
wanna be rude.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s funny. You know what? As the Maid of
honor, which is what I am and what you are not, I am asking you to just
give us a minute.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Excuse me Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I need to take it easy?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Annie, if it makes you feel any better
night.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: By this huge girl. She was a working in the
bathroom. I just… I didn’t cut in line. I didn’t! She chased me!</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Becca it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie, she looked like Popeye.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: She lives here! She lives in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re not going to run into her. Just
shut-up about it.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Guys stop! Please! Annie, I’m so sorry
about last night. I feel horrible. I want to hear everything that
happened. Tonight, you’re not leaving my side. We’re hittin’ the strip
club all of us and we’re going to put this shit behind us. Okay?! The
girls agree. Dana rubs her arm.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Oh your arm does not still hurt.</p>
<p><strong>cocktailer</strong>: What can I get you ladies?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: First of all , we’re gonna need some ones
over here. Here’s a hundred. Keep twenty for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oooh, Ann! A siren goes off.</p>
<p><strong>v.o.</strong>: Good evening ladies, and welcome to
Thunderbird. Our first male entertainer has been roaming the prairie for
many, many lonely nights… A horse winnies. Ladies scream.</p>
<p><strong>v.o.</strong>: Here he is…looking for a sweet lady to keep
him company under the stars…say hello to Cowboy Ron! A male stripper
comes out on a cardboard horse, humping</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: looking for someone. The room goes wild.</p>
<p><strong>v.o.</strong>: There he is ladies looking for that special
woman, looking for his briiide…And I believe the person he’s looking for
is Lillian Donovan! The girls scream. Lillian mouths to Annie “I’m gonna
kill you.” Cowboy Ron takes her up on stage. He puts her in a chair and
humps her face. Everyone is cracking up.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Leslie, your missing it.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Don’t talk to me. Nobody talk to me. Leslie
has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is dancing in her face.
Stripper #2 appears.</p>
<p><strong>v.o.</strong>: Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend on the
prairie and he’s lookin’ for a lady too.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Get her! Get her!!</p>
<p><strong>no! no!</strong>: Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage,
lays her on the ground and simulates sex with her. Standing above her,
pulls his chaps off. We see that his balls are not all the way tucked
into his g-string. The girls cringe. As he stands above her, in slow
motion, we see a bead of sweat leave his balls and fly into Anni’s open
laughing mouth. She dry heaves. The stripper is oblivious, goes to
another girl. Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I need some gum.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: That was disgusting! I’m so glad I’m
married.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It was awesome!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I got a picture of the balls. I got it!</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: . You lucky bitch.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Only you Annie. Hands down, best moment of
the weekend. Annie finally feels a part of the group.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh look, there’s your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ew, he’s like 65. Ok, look Lillian that’s
you.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh my God. You know who that actually looks
like? Remember when we went to Miami and we had to rent towels–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ew, at that beach, that weird beach!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: And that lady came up to us wearing that
mesh top!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She was crazy. Annie sinks. A flight
attendant appears.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Excuse me. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: I’m sorry, you can’t be up here.
You have to go back to coach.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I was just stretching my legs.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: That’s not true. Annie stares at
her. The flight attendant holds out her hand for Annie to grab.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Come on…it’s ok, c’mon. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Ok, that’s going to be seventy -five
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Twenty-five dollars a day. Three days.
Seventy -five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I thought it was seven.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Oh, hmm mm. That’s for this lot, you
parked in this lot. The lots are exactly the same, separated by a white
line. Annie empties her wallet, her poker winnings are gone.</p>
<p><strong>ext - highway</strong>: Annie is driving. She sees Rhodes,
and stops.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh, I know what’s going on. You’re jealous
of that Helen girl.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Excuse me? No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m telling you I am not jealous of Helen,
okay? She’s tall and thin and rich and pretty. They both laugh.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh come on, you know you got it goin’
on…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh yeah, I got it goin’ on…</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You’re right, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks a lot. They nudge each other. He
accidentally nudges her off the car.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Sorry! Now Annie is back in her running
car.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Have a good rest of your shift.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Actually, I’m heading home. Got my sister
staying with me for a few days. Sh’s been thinking of divorcing of her
husband.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: He had an affair and they’ve got kids so
it’s complicated.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hmm. Sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: My sister is a hell of a woman, you know?
And her husband is- you know what I think cheating is? It’s weak. It’s a
weak person that cheats. Something clicks with Annie, she sees him in a
new light.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, no. Um, I feel the same way. Um, anyway
um, maybe I’ll drive by you next week. I have to make this drive
again…so… She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back. He sees her
hickey!!!! She starts itching her arm, still flirting and laughing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ugh, great, I think I was allergic to the
soap at the hotel. Ahhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah. I should go..now. Don’t forget to call
my friend about those tail lights. They’re really starting to bug
me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I promise. Ok, well, have a good weekend.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You too. He abruptly walks back to his car.
She drives away confused.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, I’ve got good news for you. You’re
going to live. Hahahah. It’s not an allergic reaction though.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’ve got body lice.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Have you recently come in contact with or
slept anywhere that you think you might</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know where I got it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’re gonna have to wash every fabric in
your apartment and I’ll give you a topical cream that should knock it
out pretty quick. I’ve got some samples.</p>
<p><strong>ext - lillian’s apt. day</strong>: Annie sits on the
doorstep. Lillian runs up with a bunch of stuff in her arms and opens
the door. They enter the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m so sorry. I was at our travel agen’s
trying to figure out how to get my da’s family out here, they all have
to fly at different times, uggh. What’s that on your arms? She sees some
of Annie’s lice medicine motion.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Huh? Oh…I did a face mask. I must have gotten
some on me and didn’t rinse it.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh shit, I’m sorry, I have to check one
thing really quick. When is my hair consultation? Lillian frantically
looks through her calender.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Listen, I want to talk to you about–</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I knew it. I’m going to have my period on
my wedding day…and my honeymoon!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s ok. I mean it’s not like it’s your first
time doing it.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s our wedding night though!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You can still have sex, just put a towel down
in the bed.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I can’t believe this. This sucks. Oh, Annie
I wanted to ask you. Do you think for the cocktail party before the
reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio?</p>
<p><strong>annie’</strong>: Can you just realize what you just asked me
right now?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You just said a string trio or horn trio. I
thought you didn’t want anything fancy, you know, just “keep it simple.”
“Not a big deal.”</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I know but now that I’m planning everything
it’s just…I wanna do it right. It’s once in a life time. It’s my
wedding. Lillian’s phone rings.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ugh! It’s Dougie’s Mom. She’s mad at me
because I won’t let her invite everyone from her work. Oh! That reminds
me. If you’re not going to bring anybody, will you let me know? I gotta
free up some spots. Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is
speechless.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie? Where are you? Inside a truck?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I’m doing laundry, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie, the shower needs to happen soon. We
haven’t heard from you and everyone is-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know. I know. I’m trying to–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie can I dialog openly with you? I know
you’re having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I
did the shower. Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can
be very expensive and I think what’s important here is what’s best for
Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You don’t have to give me an answer now</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You should have it. You should have it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Great. Well, I’ll definitely need some
help.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ok?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Could you bring the cookies? Annie hangs up,
looks at her laundry piles. Pissed.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Excuse me!! A snotty thirteen year old,
valley-type, rich girl stands at Annie’s counter with an iced coffee
chewing gum.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m looking for a birthday gift for my best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Your best friend?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: For now.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, what’s gonna happen when you get older?
Did you ever think of that? What about when she makes new friends and
they’re more successful than you are? Girl stares annoyingly, chewing
and sipping.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Huh? And they buy her facials and designer
dresses for cheap and yo’re stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh’s
outfit cost more than your rent?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ummm….you’re weird.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re stupid.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You have no chin.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re gonna be a slut in high school.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You are an old, single loser who has no
friends, works in a jewelry store, colors her own hair, and will never
know the feeling of owning a luxury car.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show
that the girl’s dad and Donna have been there the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You know, I knew a girl once. Karen
Stippleton. She was really something. The life of the party, a concert
pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night. But one
evening at a dinner party I walked in on her in the bathroom putting a
vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last I heard, she was playing the
saxophone outside of a drug store. And I’m gonna say something to you I
should have told her. Don’t waste your life. Find out what your gifts
are and use them. Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break
room.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ooh, another package from your mom?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yep. It is a beautiful pink and white striped
box with her name and address in calligraphy. When Annie opens the lid,
“Canon in D” plays and a real butterfly flies out.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Are you kidding me? The invitation reads:</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Please join us for a Parisian Brunch at the
home of Helen Harris III to celebrate the marriage of Lillian Donovan
and Douglas Price. Let us “shower” Lillian with gifts and love. Date:
Sunday the 20th. Time: 2:00 post meridian. Address and phone number
below. Responde S’il Vous Plait. Yay! Annie picks up the phone, calls
the R.S.V.P. number. Canon in D. plays. and a recorded message
begins.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello. This is Helen. You have reached the
Responde S’il Vous Plait line for Lillian’s shower.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You have got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Please listen to all of the following menu
options before making your selection. If you would like to reply “oui”,
press one. To reply “no”, press two. For where the bride and groom are
registered, press three. If you require a vegetarian meal. Press 4. If
you are vegan, press 5. A dairy free meal, press 6. Kosher meals will

put your phone on speaker, light the Atmospheria candle you’ve just
received and think about the eternal union that is marriage. I’m Helen
Harris IV, and this is me saying au revoir! But before I do, here’s a
message from SUSAN SARANDON!</p>
<p><strong>susan sarandon</strong>: Hello, I’m Susan Sarandon, the movie
star. I just wanted to say congratulations to Lillian and Dougie. Even
though I don’t believe in marriage, I do “believe in the church of
basebal”. Just kidding. That’s a line from my movie Bull Durham. I-
Annie hangs up quickly.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is there an animal over there?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, it’s a C.D. She rolls over and turns it
off.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So, I’m flying straight to O’Hare the day of
the shower cause I wanna get my hair done. Did you see that invitation?
I didn’t get the significance of the dead butterfly, but it looks like
w’re gonna have fun.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I already know what it’s gonna be like. It’s
gonna be uncomfortable and weird…I don’t wanna go.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sweetie, listen to yourself. You ca’t let her
new friends get in the way of your being a part of one of the best days
of Lil’s life. NO way. You have a history with her that no one else has.
So you walk into that party knowing that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my God. She turns into the gates of
“Whitewater Estates.” There is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and
groom. As she gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They
smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by. At the next stop sign, a
butler appears with a tray.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Are you a guest of Helen Harris?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: The shower is one mile away. He hands her a
pink lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t have a cup-holder. As she’s driving,
little pink things start to fly beside her car.</p>
<p><strong>what the-</strong>: One flies in her car. They’re Rose
petals! Annie’s shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose petals.
At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow-tie and beret.
As she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat, another valet opens
that door and take it.</p>
<p><strong>valet</strong>: This will be placed in the gift room for you
madame. He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ll take those.</p>
<p><strong>horseman</strong>: Would you like an assisted ride to the
main house?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the
house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the
cookies. She dismounts. The front door is swung open by two attendants.
As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her…</p>
<p><strong>shower girls</strong>: This is the most amazing shower ’ve
ever been to/Can you believe this?/What a lucky bride/What a good
friend… Helen’s house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches are
puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear French standards.
Beautiful tables are set. Swans and bunnies milling about. Attendants
ready to serve. In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall
round “sign” that says “Lillian and Dougie” in puffy pink cursive. A
waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it.</p>
<p><strong>becca and leslie</strong>: Annie! They walk to her.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Do you believe this shit? Annie is still
staring at the sign.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: That’s a big cookie huh.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Where? They point to the “sign”. Annie walks
closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: See. Sugar cookie.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: It’s even better if you dip it in the
chocolate. REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls are
around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big cookie, laughing.
Helen is there taking their praise. Annie is pissed and plops her
tupperware of cookies on a nearby table.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annieee!!! Lillian runs to her.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Can you believe this?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Lillian!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Coming Mom! I gotta go say hi to my aunts.
She leaves and Helen appears out of nowhere again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi Annie!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Beautiful party.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, it’s nothing….so…Just make yourself at
home. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks. Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I said I love this shower, and i’s amazing. I
said all that. Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets
approach Helen and jam out in her face.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop dance
with the GUESTS!</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: looking.</p>
<p><strong>int-helens powder room</strong>: Annie puts lotion her hands.
She sees a magazine photo of</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: face super imposed over them. On the counter is
a framed photo of Helen, soft lit, posed with her hand gently</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: face. She also sees a photo of Helen and Lillian
from Vegas on the plane. Happy. As Annie leaves, she runs into her Mom,
wh’s new hairstyle is a bit overdone.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Mom. Hi! They hug.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow! You look great.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Thank you sweetheart. I wish Barb could see me
now.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Not today Mom.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re right. Well I’m happy to see you! I’ll
see you out there. I need to wash the horse off my hands. Mom goes into
the bathroom. Megan approaches.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie, did you see the party favors?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sure they’re perfect and amazing.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: They’re dogs!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Yeah. And they’re wrapped up like presents.
They said we have to wait until we leave but I cant stop thinking about
them. I gotta go tell Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>ext- helen’s back yard- moments later</strong>: Annie now
stands next to the chocolate fountain. She looks around, drops her glass
in it and unplugs it with her foot. It stops flowing. She looks around
and throws some leaves in it and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: attention by microphone.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello ladies. Bonjour. Yay! Welcome. I am
your host Helen, a bridesmaid in Lillian’s wedding. I want you all to
have a wonderful time. Eat, drink, please have some cookie! She laughs
and then becomes very serious.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Lillian. Today’s your day. I’d like to make a
beautiful toast, “You are pretty, fun, sweet, look at all of your
friends. Girlpower!” Everyone enjoy your lunch, served along with the
musical stylings of…The LILLIANETTE’S!!! A quartet, all in pink and
white and harmonize. ’Lillian, Lillian, Lillian, Lillian! When Lillian
was a little girl…” Judy claps and enjoys the music. She leans over to
Annie.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on honey. The shower
is a hit.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Everyone it’s game time! Please take your
piece of paper, put it on top of your head, and with your other hand try
to draw what Lillian and Dougie’s first baby is going to look like!!!
Ready? GO! Everyone draws, giggles, looks at their stupid drawings,
laughing. Annie cheats and draws it on her lap.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: And the winner is…Annie? Dana holds up a
perfectly realistic drawing of a baby.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, that’s mine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>continuous:</strong>: Girls spin a blind-folded 86 year old
ELLIE around 3 times, Then they swing her holding her hands and
feet.</p>
<p><strong>shower girls</strong>: One… two…three! Annie looks confused.
They throw Ellie onto a huge pile of pillows. This is a terrible
game.</p>
<p><strong>shower girls</strong>: Find the veil! C’mon Ellie! Come on
Look! You can do it! It’s right there! Ellie feels around in the huge
pile of pillows. She finds the veil, holds it up in victory and then
falls down from dizziness.</p>
<p><strong>shower girls</strong>: YAAAAY! YOU DID IT! WoooHoo!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: #9. What is Lillian’s favorite ice cream
flavor? Write it down…quickly.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ew. Kinda smells funny in here. Doesn’t it?
Smells bad. This house has a weird smell.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: OK, last one. For the big prize. #10. What is
the craziest place Lillian and Dougie….? Helen strongly hints with a
weird smile instead of saying, “…had sex?” Shower Girls Ooooh and
Ahhhh.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow, looks like someone’s a pervert. It’s
none of my business. She’s gross.</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: I’m putting a blue bead on this “advice
necklace” to represent the ocean. It may not always be smooth sailing
but you can ride the waves together. Dana cries and takes a picture.
Everyone applauds,</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The ocean’s are really polluted right now.
Its not something to joke about.</p>
<p><strong>int-helen’s great room - half hour later</strong>: Lillian
opens presents in front of huge photograph of herself.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh! My towels! Thank you Dana.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I just wanted to get you something you could
use everyday and something pretty. Dana takes a picture, Lillian grabs
another box, giddy.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie. Oh, our mugs! Thank you Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, you registered for ’em so thank
yourself, you picked them out. I did’t do anything…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This one’s from me. Helen hands Lillian her
gift. Lil opens it and holds up beautiful lingerie.</p>
<p><strong>shower girls</strong>: Oooo/Ahhhhh etc.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Ooh, brothel gear…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Wait, what’s this? Lillian pulls out an
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow, cash. Kinda tacky. Lillian opens the
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh my God. Helen. Lillian holds up the
tickets.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Honey what are they?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Two first class tickets to Sea World. How
did you–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Annie!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie! What is going on with you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nothing have fun at Sea World.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why don’t we go in the other room and–</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky
little cream and white cashmere–.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really don’t
know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think you do. Horses? Sculptures? Posters?
Look at this stupid house! This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture! And
look at that cookie! Would you please everyone! Speaking of that cookie.
I never got a piece! Annie marches into the back yard.</p>
<p>****: Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?! You
know what!? ’ll help you out! She tries to take down the cookie and
struggles with it. We watch her from the house. Fall over with the
cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it
over, it’s obviously too heavy. She tries to empty it with her hands
onto the ground.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a
thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate! Hello swan, are you having
fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I actually thought I wanted to be like
you…and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That’s not who I am. I
make bad choices. I’m broke, I lost my stupid job, I’m thirty two years
old and I still answer booty calls. I don’t like Mike Donahue cause he
on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I
can’t wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits
yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at
your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So
Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all
wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought
me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian
runs after her.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Annie stop! I don’t know what’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got
engaged, my life has turned to shit.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m sorry the the happiest time in my life
has brought you so much misery. Do you know how selfish that sounds?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m selfish? You’re the one that’s been so
wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this
shower, this is not you!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: This is my wedding and you’ve made it all
about you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well at least my friendship’s not for sale.
This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms back inside.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you think she still has body lice?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Anyone else?! Anyone else have something
they wanna say to me?! Dana can’t contain herself.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I got my chin done! Becca stands up.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Kevin smokes pot! Leslie stands up.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: I’m pregnant! Megan stands up.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I took two dogs already. There in the back of
my van!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thank you! Her car won’t start. Trying to
keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and
storms down the highway, trying not to cry. A cop car pulls next to her.
I’s Rhodes.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Well, I can’t say I’m surprised.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes. Taillights. I know!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You should’ve taken it to my friend-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I KNOW! Yes, you’re friend! But I didn’t ok?!
I didn’t get them fixed! I don’t–</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Whoa. Don’t take it out on me. This is your
fault.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: HE hit ME!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You had no taillights! You did’t get them
fixed! You don’t get to blame anyoe else. It’s your fault. Annie starts
to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Where you going?! Annie keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Oh, you’re going to walk fifteen miles?!
Another WISE decision!</p>
<p>****: What do you know?!!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I know that you not taking responsibility is
why we’re standing out here! YOU did not make an effort to fix that
problem. This hits Annie. Rhodes is physically worked up.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Why are you yelling at me?!</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: It’s dangerous! You’re putting your life,
and others in danger!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m! Sorry! He calms down.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Look, all I know, is that you’re kinda
crazy. You’re always stressed out or late, complaining about something,
and now you’re yelling at me! And for some reason, all I’ve ever wanted
to do is ask you on a date.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well save yourself the trouble, and
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah, I’m not much of a hickey guy anyway.
Annie remembers her hickey. He saw it?!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I have said “no” anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Well, then you have yourself a good night
ma’am. Annie regrets that. He drives away leaving her there. She is
alone.</p>
<p><strong>int - bill cozbi’s auto electric</strong>: BILL enters with a
clip board. He is a stocky Milwaukee good guy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Rhodes told me a while back you might be
stopping in. I’m Bill Cozbi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I was beginning to think we’d never see
ya.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, I know. I’m irresponsible.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nah, no one likes taking care of that stuff.
But you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: A week?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So you kind of had a bad time at the wedding
shower?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes I did. Everything’s just… She starts
crying. Steve hands her a tissue from the middle console.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry, I just–this has been a really
shitty day.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah. Ok, don’t get mad at me, but it seems
like you have a lot of those.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes I do! Right? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Have you considered the idea that maybe,
possibly, perhaps, it’s you that makes them shitty? Annie stares at
him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m just saying, maybe it’s your
attitude.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: This is not about attitude. It’s just the
facts! My life hasn’t turned it out the way I expected. I don’t have any
of those things that gives a person points in the world.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think that might be your problem. I think
you read too many of those magazines. You don’t need things to be
someone. Tyra said that. Tyra Banks.</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: Lillian. She doesn’t even know what to say, so
she doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Is anyone sitting here?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at
her.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, hey Ted. You’re in town.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Listen I’m going out tonight but I
should be home around 11, you wanna come over?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie
stops herself.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wait no. No. No. I don’t think I do. Because
answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of
no-strings-attached sex doesn’t feel good. NO girls feel good after that
and if they say they do they’re LYING. But it’s not your fault. Its me.
It’s me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her
stuff and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>’s</strong>: names cut out and being placed at different
tables. Her mom, Laurie, Helen, and two women argue about the seating
chart. Lillian looks distraught.</p>
<p><strong>back to annie’s bedroom</strong>: Annie sadly hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, I can’t think of anything else to tell
you. Did you have any questions?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I think we’ve covered everything. I’m
really excited and thank you. Annie gathers her things.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ll see you next Monday. What time do I
start?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Four a.m. Annie is a little surprised. Ti’s
smiling.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You’ll get used to it. Annie smiles back.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I won’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh and I wanna try one of those moonpies.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi, I’m here to inquire about financial aid.
Her cell phone rings.</p>
<p><strong>administration lady</strong>: Take these to the second
window.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry? Annie’s trying to find her
phone.</p>
<p><strong>administration lady</strong>: The second window.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks. It’s too late, she looks at her
phone. It was Lillian. No message. She doesn’t call her back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Parts and labor, we’re lookin’ at eight
hundred dollars. But with your discount…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Discount?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah. Rhodes and I worked out a deal way
back when, so, this one’s on the house.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yep. I owe him big time. He runs background
checks on all the guys my daughter dates. There’s been a lot of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re kidding! If you see him, would you
thank him for me and tell him that I’m crazy and I’m sorry. He’ll know
what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>’t</strong>: pull her over. She drives by him again and
swerves all over the road. He really wants to pull her over, but he
doesn’t. She goes back one more time, throws a bunch of trash and diet
coke cans out of the window. He still ignores her. She gives up and goes
home. ’t get to this point until this morning. wanted to see if we’re
going in the right direction with annie uniting bridesmaids and saving
the day.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ok, you can take Women’s Studies or
Spanish…oooh The History of Wine. The phone rings.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie. It’s Megan, Becca Leslie, Dana and
Helen.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. Hi–</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Lillian’s missing!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What do you mean she’s missing?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We were all supposed to get spray-tans today
and she never showed up. No on’s heard from her. She could be anywhere,
doing anything! She could be ANYWHERE–</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Jesus Christ, give me the God damn phone.
Leslie grabs the phone from Megan.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Annie, it’s Leslie. Look, I’m sure it’s
nothing to worry about. The weddin’s the day after tomorrow, she’s been
really stressed, so she just probably freaked out and went somewhere. We
just want to find her and probably talk her off a ledge. Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Um, gosh I..I don’t know. Um, I’ll come to
you guys. I’ll be there in an hour and 45 minutes. I wanna help. Annie
hangs up, grabs her keys. She stops, comes back and grabs a small paper
bag, and runs out the door.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What about the Science of Jazz?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Maybe she’s at the park.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The park? Don’t be stupid Dana.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Jeez, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, it’s closed is all I’m just saying.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always
hides in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: I don’t think she’d leave the country. Maybe
she went to the reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why would she go to the reservoir? Its just a
big tank of water.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning walk
there. It’s the next best thing to a lake.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh my God! I think I know where she is.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: How much further?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: I’m think I’m getting carsick.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is that supposed to be a dig on my
driving?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Well you do speed up and slow down a lot.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t take a stunt driving
course in Renegade missions.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Why do you always have to be so
condescending?</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Yeah, its getting really old.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I was being funny!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Well it came out a little mean Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dana who’s side are you on? All the girls
start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and
drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She
pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Did we hit something!?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Was it a person?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Guys it’s just a flat. I’ve gotten tons of
them. Annie goes to get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>becca/dana</strong>: No!/ Annie don’t get out!/ It’s pitch
dark out.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Everybody calm down. I’m calling 911.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: You don’t call 911 for a flat tire! A huge
truck drives by moving their car a little bit. The girls SCREAM!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Guys! We’re fine. Helen, put the hazards on.
Helen puts them on.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: I’m calling AAA.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: I’m calling Kevin!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Helen, do you have a jack?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Probably?!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: What if we get hit just sitting here? Or
kidnapped or chased by an animal?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Dana calm down.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Shit! I don’t have any service.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Me neither!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Oh my God! We’re gonna die… Annie has had
enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele’s
trunk, lifts the bottom She goes up to the window.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Everyone’s gotta get out, if you want me to
fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i’s cold, but they do. Annie
puts the jack under car.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: So, how can I help?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch
as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she’s doing! The car
is raising.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to
her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with
Leslie by her side. Dana and Becca stand with Helen.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: That’s pretty cool she knows how to do change
a tire.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: I know. I can’t believe she’s doing it. Dana
and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just don’t scratch anything. The girls are
all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: So what are you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m removing the lug nuts so we can take the
tire off.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: How does that little thing lift the whole
car?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human
being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: How do you know this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I like cars. There’s a real artistry to
them.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Are you guys working or talking? We do’t have
all night.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Annie is doing the best she can Helen. So why
don’t you just stand over there and be quiet and wait.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with
Helen.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck
up!!!?? Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Lillian probably left because of you
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: You’re so- bossy! You’ve been acting like
you’re in charge this whole time! Do’t you realize how much pressure
sh’s under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a
unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said “That’s not me.” And you ordered it
anyway! You’ve been pushing her this whole time! Annie was right.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Yeah! Helen glares at Megan.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What are you talking about? The only reason
you’re even in this wedding is because you’re the groom’s sister.
Weirdo.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I’d rather be the groom’s sister than have
cameltoe from my $600 pants. We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has
surprised them.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn’t the
one who caused a huge scene at Lillian’s bridal shower and made her
cry.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion
but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over. The guy gets out
of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at- shirt with a cat on it and
camouflage shorts.</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: Hey it’s pretty late. What are you
ladies doing? Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets behind
the car.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Just changing the tire.</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: You guys need some man hands for
that?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nope I think we got it. But thank you. He
doesn’t leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: Look, if you guys get tired, I live
right up that hill. You ladies can just leave your car here, come on up
and let us all lay down together. He starts to walk toward them. The
girls are scared. Annie gives Megan a look. Megan tries to distract
him.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Hey! Are those snowflake rims? The guy looks
at Megan.</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: Yeah, found ’em in a junk yard.
Restored ’em myself.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: Well, well. Someone knows her
cars.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: I’m in the Firebird club.</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: You don’t say. I never met a lady in
the FBC before. He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie
rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals
in Dayton? Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They talk
in a loud whisper.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: What’s happening? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I can hear animals.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: Be quiet! The guy is moving closer to
Megan.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Remember Smokey and the Bandit?</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: It’s my favorite movie. “Give me a
Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it quick . I’m in a goddamn
hurry.” He leans into her.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Why don’t you show me what’s under the hood?
Back at Helen’s car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: How’s it comin’?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Almost there. The guy has lifted up his hood
and Mega’s looking. He puts his hands on her ass.</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: You wanna get in the backseat?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Uh… He is really getting aggressive, pushing
against her.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Hey take it easy!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hey what about me? He turns around to be hit
with a huge piece of wood by Helen. He falls.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Oh my God!! Annie is frantically releasing the
jack.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan,
Helen let’s go! All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it.
Annie is finishing.</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: Hey you!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie get in!</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: I’m gonna get you bitches!! He is
coming towards Annie! She turns towards him with the jack.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so far
down your throat you will shit out…your fucking..face!</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: Whoa, whoa. Alright. Alright. I’m
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>trans am man</strong>: I am! I live up the hill though if you
change your mind. Annie backs up and jumps in the car. Helen peels away.
The girls drive away fast.</p>
<p><strong>continuous</strong>: The girls still driving. Megan’s eating
chips.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up
against you. That was a pretty gutsy move.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Annie’s the one who tried to make him eat a
car jack.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Helen hit him over the head with a tree. They
all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: There it is, turn left up here. Go down the
little hill. Ok, that’s the driveway. It’s dark and very rustic. It’s
LILLIAN’S LAKE HOUSE FROM THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie
met.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: God I haven’t been here in forever.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The house is right up here. They pull up to a
small cottage and get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Her car’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Doesn’t look like any lights are on.</p>
<p><strong>becca</strong>: She’s not here. Annie is sitting on the front
step, defeated.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I thought she’d be here. I really thought
she’d be here. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Annie, it’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, it’s not. I don’t know what happened. I
messed everything up. Lillia’s not even talking to me. I think I’m so
afraid to see what’s really happening. Lillian’s moving on to this great
life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don’t fit
in to her life now. Everyone is silent.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Annie, Lillian loves you. haven’t made things
easy for you.. I don’t have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away
and I’m constantly alone and she’s been there. And I’ve been a
bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I….I’ve never
been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian
because… I don’t have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better
and to impress her, and everyone else. And I’m just good at throwing
parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask
me to be in their wedding’s because of that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lillian wouldn’t do that. If she asked you to
be in her wedding it’s because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is
crying and takes a picture. The’re both startled by the flash.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m sorry about the Sea World tickets.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry that when I left the shower I told
your neighbors you were shooting a porn.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, I didn’t know that you did that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, well, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I deserved it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I must say you do put on some pretty
spectacular events.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, I’m really rich. They smile.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It is getting pretty late.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: What should we do about Lillian?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: She’ll come home when she’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Yeah. Didn’t mean to make anyone worry.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s okay. I really am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m sorry too. I didnt want things to turn
out like this. I got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting
this one day to be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well its easy to get caught up.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: And it doesnt help that all my friends hate
eachother.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m sorry. But it’s all good now. We all
talked and everythings cool.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Really?!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yup, Helen and I are best friends now. We’re
going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: She’s really not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I just wish the wedding hadnt become about
everything and everyone else but me and Dougie. And now, it’s become
this thing I never wanted. I did want simple. I wanted colored lanterns,
twinkly lights and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to play all those
stupid wedding songs.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s not too late to have those things.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t know all the stuff you
were going through too. Annie is clearly sad.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s fine. I just feel really lost right</p>
<p><strong>now and–</strong>: Lillian hugs her.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Nothing’s going to change.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh God dont say that.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I mean between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You want to come in? Steve’s home. This could
be your last chance as a single woman.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Ooooo…</p>
<p><strong>ext highway. very early next morning</strong>: The small
paper bag sits on the side of the road. Cop car pulls up. This is
Rhodes’ spot, we’ve seen before. He gets out and walks over to it,
confused. He picks it up and it says, “Officer Rhodes”. He’s a little
weary but opens it and pulls out a note. “I hear you like moonpies.” He
looks in the bag and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thanks a lot for bringing me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thanks for coming with me. Megan appears on
her other side.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Yeah, thanks for bringing him.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: So when does school start?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: A week. I’m scared. I’m gonna be the oldest
one there.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: So what? Now you can have an affair with
your teacher and it won’t be gross. They walk down the steps.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Thanks for everything today. Yo’ve been the
best Maid of Honor ever.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: MMM. No. That’s not true at all. You were
pretty terrible. Today you were good. Annie sees the hotel shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You’re always gonna be my best friend. They
hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I will see YOU in a couple weeks
Mrs. Price!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course. The
shuttle is gone, but there’s something that was on the other side of
it.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Need a ride ma’am? It’s Rhodes, leaning
against his car like Jake in sixteen candles. Annie is all smiles and
walks up to him.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How did you know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: It was really complicated. I remembered the
name of this place, I called them up, told them I was a cop calling on
official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made
them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months
with a bride named Lillian. Annie smiles.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Wow. They’re looking at each other, not
knowing what to do.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: So, did you get the moonpies?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yes I did.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Did you like’ em?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah. No. I couldn’t eat them. They were
completely covered in ants.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ooo, I didn’t think about that.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: You probably should have put it in a plastic
wrap or maybe a foil or something. Tupperware would’ve worked but then
I’d have to get it back to you-I’m gonna kiss you right now so… He walks
to her and takes her in his arms. They are about to kiss. Rhodes
stops.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I didn’t want to miss my chance again.</p>
<p>****: Me neither. They MAKE OUT. The end.</p>
<p><strong>alt ending</strong>: Annie is walking back to her hotel. A
cop car pulls up next to her.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Need a ride ma’am? She turns to see Rhodes
driving slowly next to her.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How did you know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I’m a cop. They’re looking at each other,
not knowing what to do.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: So, did you get the moonpies?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yes I did.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Did you like’ em?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Yeah. No. I couldn’t eat them. They were
completely covered in ants.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ooo, I didn’t think about that.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: The real reason I came here today is that I
have something that belongs to you. He opens his hand to reveal the ugly
carrot. She smiles. He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She
gets in. They drive off into the sunset.</p>
