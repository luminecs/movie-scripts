<p><strong>fade in on</strong>: TITLE: PROLOGUE LONDON, 1920.</p>
<p><strong>1 int. museum of ivan igor</strong>: where he exhibits groups
and individuals done in wax. The figures are of historic characters and
events. The place is almost in darkness as the steel blinds are drawn on
the windows facing the street. Through the back and side windows we see
and hear a pouring rain. At the fade in we hear the distant rumbling of
thunder, and shortly thereafter there is a blinding flash of lightning
through the unshuttered windows showing in clear relief a brutal,
sinister face, the black hood and cowl suggesting a medieval monk. We
see, lying at the foot of the monkish figure, a seminude figure of a
woman whose back is sadly lacerated. She is lying face down. In the
monk’s hand is a knout or cat-o’-nine-tails, as though he had been
punishing her.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. street long shot museum in background</strong>: It is
raining and we see an occasional flash of lightning. The figure of Worth
on the opposite side of street from museum, walking rapidly AWAY FROM
CAMERA, comes to a point diagonally opposite museum and glances
furtively about, starts toward the entrance. When a policeman appears,
he darts quickly to a doorway, concealing himself. The officer crosses
the street and disappears along an intersecting street. Worth makes a
second endeavor to approach the museum, when a hansom cab draws up to
the curb and Dr. Rasmussen and Golatily alight and cross the sidewalk
toward door. Worth slinks back to his hiding place. The cab draws
away.</p>
<p><strong>golatily</strong>: A beastly hour to disturb the fellow.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Not at all. He works late and he’ll be
delighted.</p>
<p><strong>5 int. museum close shot of igor</strong>: washing hands. He
straightens up and glances toward door, showing annoyance, then starts
toward door. The knock is repeated.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. museum</strong>: Rasmussen is pressing his face to
glass, looks through, and we see, through the glass panel of the door,
Igor approaching. When he glimpses his visitors, his expression changes
from annoyance to one of extreme pleasure, and hastening his stride he
opens the door quickly.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Well, well, my friend, this is an unexpected
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: I shouldn’t have thought of disturbing
you but it happens the friend I told you of is leaving tomorrow to
supervise some new excavations in Egypt, and he was anxious to look at
your collection before going away. May I present Mr. Golatily?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It is a great pleasure. I have heard so much
about you.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. museum</strong>: The three men enter museum, Igor
closing the door and locking it. Igor laughs.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: My children will become conceited that so
distinguished a critic has thought them interesting enough to
review.</p>
<p><strong>8 ext. museum from opposite side of street</strong>: Worth,
standing in doorway opposite museum, waiting impatiently.</p>
<p><strong>8a int. museum</strong>: Igor throws light switches, one at a
time, each circuit illuminating a different group. He names them as he
throws each switch.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Sidney Carton on the Guillotine.</p>
<p><strong>9 close shot</strong>: of the figure. We hear Golatily’s
voice.</p>
<p><strong>golatily’s voice</strong>: Very interestingly done.</p>
<p><strong>igor’s voice</strong>: Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen’s voice</strong>: I was particularly interested in
this one. See the fineness with which he has mounted that beard.</p>
<p><strong>igor’s voice</strong>: Joan d’Arc.</p>
<p><strong>golatily’s voice</strong>: It’s a pity to race through such
an exhibition. One should have time to really study them.</p>
<p><strong>igor’s voice</strong>: Voltaire.</p>
<p><strong>golatily</strong>: You could almost expect him to speak. I
wonder what he’d say after all these years.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You would be astonished. He is more difficult
now, to those in authority, than even the records show. He was a very
stubborn person, I assure you.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Stubborn?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Unbelievably. For days I argued with this
fellow before I could get him as I wanted him. But always I triumphed …
… and few people triumphed over Voltaire. And here … … we have something
that pleases me, though of no historic importance. It was done because I
love to model children.</p>
<p><strong>9a ext. street in front of museum</strong>: Worth, as he
throws away cigarette impatiently and takes new place of
concealment.</p>
<p><strong>10 int. museum</strong>: The three men are strolling toward
the figure of Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p><strong>golatily</strong>: But you have no right to hide such genius
in a side street museum.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You are too gracious. These things have some
merit, I suspect … but this– … I am convinced, is fine.</p>
<p><strong>golatily</strong>: Even those delicate veins, the texture of
this flesh – I have never seen anything more exquisite.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: My partner believes that I should build a
horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of
London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has
promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.</p>
<p><strong>golatily</strong>: She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If
you’ll grant me the privilege, I’d like to submit this work to the Royal
Academy when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You will have won the undying gratitude of us
all. Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?</p>
<p><strong>golatily</strong>: I regret I can’t spend the time I’d like
with your exhibition, but I’m going to worry the life out of you when I
come back.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It will always afford me great pleasure to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>golatily</strong>: Good night, sir.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Good night. And I am very grateful to you.</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. museum main entrance</strong>: Door opens. Golatily
and Rasmussen come through door. Igor is speaking.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Thank you so much for your visit and
encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. museum</strong>: The two men pass the spot where
Worth has concealed himself. He peers after them from the shadows, then
crosses street toward museum and walks toward door of entrance.</p>
<p><strong>13 int. museum</strong>: Igor, with the exuberance of a
delighted child, runs to the figure of Marie Antoinette and caresses
her.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You heard what he said. You heard this man who
is very celebrated, what he said of you? Ho-ho-ho, of course, you would
say that. You always told me so, of course. And you, my friends –
Robespierre, Danton, Marat, Maximilian, Savonarola, all of you, how will
you feel to be famous again?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And even you, who scoffed at immortality, who
wrote so eloquently against the thought of immortality, you are
experiencing it in spite of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Hello! What are you doing here so late?</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: I came back for some of the books. I am
trying to straighten out the accounts. I don’t hope to impress you, but
I may as well tell you: We haven’t a farthing!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: That is unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>14 close-up worth</strong>: He is furious.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: You’re right it’s unfortunate! Fifteen
thousand pounds it’s cost me! And you say it’s unfortunate, as though
I’d spilled a spot of grog on my waistcoat.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Your money may have been well invested, my
friend. Something important may come of all this.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Something important has got to come of it! Do
you know that the rent on this place isn’t paid?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: No – I’m lying to amuse myself! Now look
here, I’ve an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven’t twopence
between us, but we’ve got these.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Fire insurance!</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Yes, there’s our way out. A fire in this
place would give us ten thousand pounds.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my
friend?</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: I want the money back I’ve thrown into this
rubbish heap.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You are asking to burn these people … you are
asking? …</p>
<p><strong>16 int. museum med.shot</strong>: Igor makes a sweeping
gesture that takes in the entire room.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: … to destroy all this?</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: I’m not asking you anything. I’m telling you
what I’m going to do!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And you think I will permit this, my
friend?</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: You’ve got to permit it! Whose fault is it
that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and
why? They’ve got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the
Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate
such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Well, what do you think I’m in this for?
Think of it, man, a match – a cigar stub – and ten thousand pounds to
divide between us!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Not at all – let me show you how easily it
can be done.</p>
<p><strong>17 ext. areaway back of museum</strong>: We see Worth come
through door, panting and disheveled. He starts away and then returns
and locks door, after which he runs from scene.</p>
<p><strong>18 int. museum</strong>: Igor, dazed and weak, is struggling
to his feet. He looks toward the figure of Marie Antoinette, its
draperies now a mass of flame. He dashes toward it, catching it up in
his arms, attempting to beat out the fire. The whole room now resembles
the inside of a furnace, and as Igor, carrying the flaming figure,
struggles toward the door, a portion of the ceiling collapses, barring
his progress. He turns and staggers toward the rear. His clothes are
blazing. He runs to a small iron trap in floor, near which is a group
tableau of Sidney Carton on the Guillotine. Lifting the cover, he
discloses an empty drain barely large enough to permit the passage of
his body. As he disappears through trap, the rope suspending the blade
of the guillotine burns through and the knife falls, decapitating the
figure, and the head rolls across the floor."</p>
<p><strong>20 street corner a crowd of people</strong>: An ambulance
driving around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>21 ext. of apartment building</strong>: with all the windows
lighted. Some windows still have Christmas ornaments in them. The CAMERA
ON CRANE MOVES UP TO various windows. As the screaming of the siren and
arrival of ambulance evidently attract the attention of the dwellers,
several people open their windows and look out curiously. Some of them
are holding cocktail glasses, and as the windows are opened we hear the
strains of radio music and other sounds of joyous celebrating. In the
last window we see Igor in his legitimate make-up – not as a horror
person – looking at something across the street.</p>
<p><strong>22 ext. of other apartment house at corner</strong>: The
ambulance parked in front of it and a number of curious people standing
about. The door of the apartment house is opened by a man in uniform,
and we see a doctor carrying a medical case coming out of the house. A
newspaper reporter runs up the steps to meet him and says:</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Anything new, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Nothing we didn’t tell you this afternoon.
The coroner confirmed our opinion – it was suicide.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Of newspaper heading:</p>
<p><strong>the new york express</strong>: WISHES ITS READERS A HAPPY NEW
YEAR.</p>
<p><strong>beautiful joan gale</strong>: A SUICIDE</p>
<p><strong>24 int. worth house</strong>: CAMERA FOLLOWS him through a
corridor into a room as dilapidated and forbidding as the exterior of
the house. The room, evidently used as an office, is furnished with an
ancient, battered desk and chairs. The walls are bare, and in places the
paper, and even bits of plaster, have been torn away.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hello, is that you, Tim? … Tim, I’m sorry but
I’ve got to have that tonight … I’ve got to have it.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No, I need it right away.</p>
<p><strong>25 close-up of worth’s face</strong>: and we see that it is
the man who burned the museum. All through the phone conversation we
hear the muffled shouts, the horns, etc. of the New Year
celebration.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who’s on at the gate? … you say Joe? … Well,
then you can get it out all right. I’ll have the truck right down there.
The harness bull down there is oke. I fixed that this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>26 street outside the morgue</strong>: A policeman walking
leisurely along his beat reaches the iron gate and glances up at the
sign above the arch, which reads Morgue. We hear the distant shouting,
singing, trumpeting. After the officer has disappeared, an upper window
of the building opens and the hideous face of the Monster appears as he
leans out of the window following the progress of the policeman along
the street.</p>
<p><strong>28 close shot of monster</strong>: bending over slab as he
examines figure illuminated by flashlight. We do not see the features of
the corpse. As the Monster straightens up, he utters a horrible
gurgling, retching murmur of joy, and we see him clearly for the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>29 close-up monster</strong>: A black-cloaked figure,
disproportionate and grotesque, the face a horrible formless mass of
scarred tissue. He has practically no forehead. His face is a shriveled
bald pate of seared skin and bone, which recedes to a pointed cranium of
unnatural contour. His eyes are alight with fanaticism and insanity. The
face is a blot of drawn, unwholesomely colored, hairless skin. He is
lipless, noseless, and what traces of human features remain are
frightfully distorted. CAMERA RECEDES TO</p>
<p><strong>30 med. shot</strong>: and TRAVELS WITH him as he pushes the
carriage quickly to the back window and places it against the sill, feet
first.</p>
<p><strong>31 close shot at window</strong>: He opens the window, which
has a single bar from top to bottom dividing its center. He leans out
and whistles. During all of this we have been hearing the joyous shouts
of the merrymakers. In answer to his signal there is a single whistle
from someplace below. He throws the sheet aside and fastens a rope
around and under the arms of the corpse, which he pushes slowly across
the sill into space. After lowering the body, there is a whistle from
below. He throws the remainder of the coil of rope out the window, but
on the opposite side of the upright bar, so that the rope forms a double
strand outside, permitting him to slide to ground level. CAMERA ANGLE
WIDENS and we PAN WITH the Monster as he returns the slab to its
original position. He hears someone approaching and stretches out at
length on the slab, covering himself with the sheet. The voices grow
louder and the CAMERA SWINGS, PICKING UP TWO attendants and FOLLOWING
them as they enter. One of them throws on the lights, and they wheel
another body into place beside the slab on which the Monster is
concealed.</p>
<p><strong>first attendant</strong>: New Year’s Eve ain’t what it used
to be. This is only the second one tonight.</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: Yeah, times are sure tough.</p>
<p><strong>first attendant</strong>: What happened to this one?</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: Husband slapped her full of lumps
… said she talked too much.</p>
<p><strong>first attendant</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: Embalming fluid makes ’em
jump.</p>
<p><strong>second attendant</strong>: Ain’t that just like a woman …
always has to have the last word.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Showing base of upright bar of window with
rope looped over. Evidently safe on the ground, the Monster pulls one
end of rope, and we see it running around bar until the end
disappears.</p>
<p><strong>32 close-up of typewriter and hands operating
machine</strong>: CAMERA PULLS BACK:</p>
<p><strong>33 composing room of the new york express night</strong>:
CAMERA PICKS UP a door at the end of a line of tables, with typewriters,
where rewrite men are busy on copy, copy boys bringing them assignments,
carrying away completed stories, etc. Sign on door reads Managing
Editor. CAMERA SWINGS the length of the lane, PICKS UP door at opposite
end of room, and with a sudden, terrific blast of steam whistles, etc.,
the door opens and the girl, Florence , appears through door, obviously
squiffy, leading a nondescript mongrel dog. She carries a long, cheap
tin horn. The man nearest the door glances up from his work.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Gentlemen of the Daily Grind: 1932 salutes
you with a fanfare of golden brass!</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Save your breath. Hard-Tack wants to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I don’t want to see him – he hurts my
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: No kiddin’, he’s sore as a dog.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Move over Kelly. I’m in the dog house!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Where’d you get the stag hound?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: He’s not a stag hound. His name is Kelly
and he’s a police dog.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What do you mean police dog?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Plain-clothes man. Come on, slaves, drink
and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to
Washington … a fate worse than death.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty
sore.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Ain’t that something. The mad monk of
Manhattan. Here goes nothing. Listen to the animal cracker roar like a
lion.</p>
<p><strong>34 int. editor’s office</strong>: The managing editor , a man
of about thirty-five, not physically unattractive, but rather grim, is
seated at his desk – an intense worker, plainly impatient with anyone
who loafs on the job.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: As I live and breathe and wear spats … the
prince.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda
again?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Where did you get the news item? From a
little bird?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Yeah. Have a pleasant vacation?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Charming. More delightful people
crippled.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Great. Consider yourself crippled –
financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough
to eat on.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: That you’re a sure bet to place in the bread
line. There’s no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You’re easy
on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.</p>
<p><strong>35 close shot of florence</strong>: as she walks down and
puts her arm over editor’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Is mama’s dumpling getting tough?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I’m through clowning. You’re all washed up.
Get out!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: What do you mean, you poor ham! This is
New Year’s!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: All right, what about it? We get out a paper
just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, is it my fault if nothing
happens?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Look down there! Nothing happening! Out of
that insane mob you say there’s nothing happening? There’s a story in
every person down there.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: And how does one go about getting these
human documents, may I inquire?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: That is none of our business. But you bring
me something for the next edition if it’s only a recipe for
spaghetti!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Quick, Watson, the cookbook!</p>
<p><strong>36. int. composing room full shot</strong>: as Florence
reenters. Sits on desk of last man she spoke to.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: What a sense of humor that guy has. Thinks
a hangover is a Jewish holiday. I’m fired!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I told you he was a sore.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Stories scarcer than caviar at a street
cleaner’s banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get
a story.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Here’s a wow.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hey, come here, Kelly. I don’t want you
hanging around with that guy. He’s been reading naughty stories.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE-UP OF COVER OF MAGAZINE:entitled
"Naughty Stories." Shows scantily attired figure of a girl dancer.</p>
<p><strong>37 close-up of desk sergeant absorbed in magazine</strong>:
at 47th Street Police Station.</p>
<p><strong>38 full shot police station reception room</strong>: Several
uniformed men seated, reading late editions, etc. Florence enters with
gay, almost rowdy camaraderie and thumps one of the officers on the
back.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Happy New Year, Ambrose!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Dempsey. I don’t see how
they’re ever going to settle that heavyweight argument while you’re
around.</p>
<p><strong>39 close shot desk</strong>: Florence crosses to desk and,
reaching over, pulls the magazine out of the sergeant’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Happy New Year, sweetheart. How’s your sex
life? Oh-oh!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Call the Homicide Squad!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: How’s every little thing?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Fine. You’re the first reporter in here
for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’m people which the old year saw out. I’m
canned, fired!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No kiddin’.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’ve got to make news, if I have to bite a
dog. Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I’ve got a story for you. You know the
Joan Gale girl?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Yes, she committed suicide yesterday.
That’s not news. I heard about it last year.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn’t commit suicide.
She may have been murdered!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No foolin’ – any suspect?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Do you know George Winton?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Old Howard Winton’s cub?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: They don’t suspect <I>him</I>?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Don’t they? He’s down at The Tombs right
now.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Say, if you’re stringin’ me, Old-Timer
…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Why would I string y’? They were sweeties
until a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: What does that prove?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Nothing. Only she may have tried to
blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her
apartment a few hours before she was found dead.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hotcha! Saved, one job!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Press room for yours.</p>
<p><strong>40 full shot police station reception room</strong>: as
Florence starts to door.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: But hold everything. Let me give you the
rest of the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Make it snappy, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: There’s an autopsy ordered at Bellevue
immediately. You better skip over there.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Don’t give this to anybody else, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. worth house</strong>: A small covered truck drives up
and stops. A man riding beside the driver jumps down and, glancing
quickly up and down the street, runs down the basement steps and rings
bell.</p>
<p><strong>42 close shot basement door</strong>: Lattice is drawn aside
and a man peers out.</p>
<p><strong>door tender</strong>: Get it all right?</p>
<p><strong>driver’s companion</strong>: Yes … let’s get it off the
truck. Lend us a hand.</p>
<p><strong>door tender</strong>: Hey, Sparrow – come on!</p>
<p><strong>43 int. a large, sparsely furnished basement room</strong>:
There are a number of crates and boxes piled in one corner, and on a
plain kitchen table, center, there are a number of bottles, glasses,
etc. The four men enter and deposit the case, which is marked Fragile –
Handle with Care, on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>door tender</strong>: How about a little shot?</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Happy New Year!</p>
<p><strong>driver’s companion</strong>: See you some more!</p>
<p><strong>44 full shot of basement room</strong>: as the two men exit.
Door tender turns toward Sparrow and CAMERA MOVES UP TO A</p>
<p><strong>door tender</strong>: No use of your hangin’ around here. He
told me not to give you anything tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Where is he? Call him down, willya? I’ve
got to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: I thought I told you to stay out of here!</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Hello, Joe. I wouldn’t bother you, but I’m
all in. My nerves are all shot.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Your nerves are not all that are going to be
shot, you sneaky rat – you’ve been talking again!</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Give him a deck.</p>
<p><strong>46 full shot of basement room</strong>: as door tender
extracts a small parcel from drawer in table and tosses it to Sparrow,
who grabs it eagerly and struggles to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: And understand this, you get nothing more
from me until you show me something! And the next time you speak out of
turn, you’re going to have bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Thanks … thanks.</p>
<p><strong>47 top of table pitcher of ice water, glasses night</strong>:
Florence approaches table, pours a glass of ice water and, before
drinking it, presses it to her forehead and temple. CAMERA SWINGS
showing rest of room, which is evidently a morgue surgery. There are
several officials, internes, a nurse, two doctors, two or three
plain-clothes men and a policeman in uniform who is standing guard at
the door. One of the plain- clothes men, who evidently knows Florence,
crosses and speaks to her.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Feelin’ tough?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’ve got a case of jitters that will cop
the Pulitzer prize. If they drag this out too long, they’ll have another
corpse on their hands.</p>
<p><strong>first doctor</strong>: When I was called, doctor, the girl
had been dead for possibly three or four hours. My examination showed
clearly that she died of laudanum poisoning. I thought at first it might
have been an accident, an overdose. Her eyes indicated that she used
narcotics frequently.</p>
<p><strong>second doctor</strong>: What was the police theory?</p>
<p><strong>first doctor</strong>: Suicide.</p>
<p><strong>second doctor</strong>: Leave any message?</p>
<p><strong>first doctor</strong>: No. That’s why I thought death might
have been accidental.</p>
<p><strong>first doctor</strong>: Who got the information about Winton,
Flannery?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Everyone knows they was livin’ together.
But the way they fought you’d of thought they was married.</p>
<p><strong>first doctor</strong>: Been separated quite some time, hadn’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Yeah. He was playin’ up to some other
twist. Winton’s in bad because he left there just before she folded
up.</p>
<p><strong>second doctor</strong>: Well, if she committed suicide, with
laudanum, she probably took it in its crude form, and we’ll find it in
that or very close to that state. If someone gave it to her, it would be
diluted.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: How could he give it to her?</p>
<p><strong>first doctor</strong>: In a cup of coffee or a glass of
whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: The Gale body is gone!</p>
<p><strong>first doctor</strong>: Gone? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>second doctor</strong>: The body gone! Absurd!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Wait a minute. What happened? What do you
mean the body’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Just that. It’s gone – vanished –
disappeared!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You mean somebody stole the body!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No. It got up and walked down to the
cemetery to dig up a date.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: We went for the body and found the slab
empty and the window to the alley open.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hot dog, death on a holiday!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Come on, Flannery!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Boy, oh boy! And he asked for a story. Is
his face red! She looks around, sees phone, grabs it up and calls for a
number.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Bryant two six two six.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Operator! My, my, how you have grown. Will
you get that number, Mrs. Van Winkle!</p>
<p><strong>49 editor’s office</strong>: The phone on his desk is
ringing. He picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hello, Slug … kill that Winton story for
this! Joan Gale’s body, not John Brown’s … Joan Gale’s body was snatched
from the morgue two minutes ago! I’m here now! Yeah, there were nine or
ten witnesses! Nope, they didn’t talk! They’re pretty stiff. No, dope,
not drunk, they’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Can the clowning! Great! Great! Tear down to
The Tombs and get to Winton! I’ll have Harry write the first flash! A
cow does that … and gives milk besides.</p>
<p><strong>52 close-up printing presses in large newspaper

examine it for type.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE-UP OF NEWSPAPER:showing scare headline
describing arrest of George Winton who is held in jail and an autopsy
ordered. On front page is a photograph of Winton. CAMERA HOLDS for a
moment on photograph, which DISSOLVES TO:</p>
<p><strong>54 int. cell in the tombs</strong>: Winton seated on the edge
of his cot. CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal the cell door being opened by
a guard. Florence enters and goes to boy. He is a rather handsome, but
weak, dissipated type, who arouses our sympathy without winning our
respect.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: How do you do. I’m from the Express.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me
for something I didn’t do. I didn’t! You understand that! … I didn’t do
it! She – tried before –</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Come on, old man, that won’t do. You know
you’re innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Yes, sure, that’s fine. While I’m proving my
innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever
did … you’re going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever
drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a
sinister meaning, if I did it. Go on! Get out! I don’t want to talk to
you!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Listen, kid. You’re in a tough spot, and
you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the
cry-baby stuff –</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Cry-baby?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: My lawyers will be on the job in a little
while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you’ve got to
prove. Dad won’t stand for–</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let’s
get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: For a few minutes the afternoon before –
before –</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hmmm. Why didn’t you tell that to the
police?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: They didn’t give me a chance. We had a
couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said?
What did you talk about?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: She laughed and told me that we were being
silly, that we didn’t care for each other any more but we needn’t hate
each other … … She said she wanted to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I see. Was that all she said?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: We planned a trip for her. I was going to
send her to Bermuda.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: You weren’t going with her?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: No. Why didn’t I take her out somewhere? But
she was laughing and seemed so happy.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, let’s get back to the case in hand.
They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the
morgue.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? …
You’re working with the police! … You’re trying to make me say something
that can be used against me! You’re trying …</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hold on, hold on. I’m trying to help you,
if you’re on the square, and I think you are.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Then why are you telling me a crazy lie?
…</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: That happens to be the truth.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Who’d steal her body?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: That’s what they’re going to ask you.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Time’s up.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Be right with you. Keep a stiff upper lip,
kid. I think you’ll come out okay.</p>
<p><strong>55 close shot of editor at his desk</strong>: He is leaning
back in swivel chair, listening attentively. We hear Florence’s voice,
but do not see her.</p>
<p><strong>florence’s voice</strong>: The whole thing sounded on the up
and up to me. The poor kid is too scared to lie. He’s getting a raw
deal.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Well, ain’t that a shame. Nice little
chappie that wouldn’t harm a fly … everybody picking on the little
fellow.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: If this kid was some unknown soda jerker,
they wouldn’t have pinched him. But he’s George Winton and they’re
playing him up. It’s a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New
York.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Why the goose pimples? If he wasn’t social
register – if it was somebody like me, you’d be trying to hang him.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I wouldn’t be trying, beloved. I would
hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing.
Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen
months. Doesn’t it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that
angle?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: And ruin a perfectly good story? Don’t be
silly.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No, I mean it. I think this kid’s entitled
to a break.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: He’s getting a break, ain’t he? He’s front
page.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: You give me a pain!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I’m glad to hear it. When did you go in for
crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in
the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He’s kept out o’ print
because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, anyway, he couldn’t have copped that
body – he was in jail.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: You don’t think he’d be sap enough to do the
job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn’t kill the
kid, he’s responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time
without making me sore.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, I won’t work on it from that
angle.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Oh, you won’t – you were pretty tough about
Judge Ramsey – a little while ago –</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: And they never proved anything against
him.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Except that he disappeared when things got
too hot.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Or was bumped off by someone who was
afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Whooey – he took a run-out powder.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, that’s got nothing to do with this
case. Can I handle this my way?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: You cannot. I’m still editor of this
sheet.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: All right, you said I was fired. Well, I
quit! Give the assignment to somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Hey, come here, Sob-sister!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Nope, I’m through!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Go ahead, screwy! Do it your own way.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: On the square, Jimmy, if you’d seen Winton
down there – I’m not holding a brief for him – maybe he’s a dirty pup,
but he’s scared and hysterical – and so kinda dumb and worthless …</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Great! … If he’s worthless we’ll give him
away as a bridge prize. Come on – beat it. It’s five o’clock. You need
some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No, there’s another point I want to iron
out.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Sleep on it … we’ll get it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Your portrait.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: OF PICTURE:which is a crude sketch of Mickey
Mouse on horseback, charging a windmill with a long lance.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Which one is me? The horse?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>56 close-up of three city street-sweepers’ push
brooms</strong>: held end to end, pushing ahead of them a large quantity
of confetti, bits of paper and refuse of the hilarious night before.
CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing three street- sweepers. In the background
we see the sign:</p>
<p><strong>london wax museum – grand opening</strong>: TONIGHT FIRST
TIME IN AMERICA</p>
<p><strong>igor’s voice</strong>: Otto! Otto! Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>57 int. museum med. shot of igor</strong>: In background we
see a veritable beehive of activity. A number of workmen, including
painters, carpenters, are busy building and designing screenlike
backgrounds for the various exhibits, placing figures on platforms, etc.
In the center of the room, watching them, is Ivan Igor. CAMERA MOVES TO
A</p>
<p><strong>58 close shot of igor</strong>: He is much changed, but still
recognizable as the man we knew before the fire. His beard and hair are
almost white and have been permitted to grow to far greater length, but
the features are essentially the same, except that when he speaks or
moves his face is strangely immobile. He is seated in a wheelchair,
which is propelled by sprocket wheels on the arms of the chair. In order
to manage this, there is a special cup or basket attached to the
handles, as his hands are hideously deformed and practically useless for
the purpose. He is impatient and angry with the workers, venting his
anger immediately the janitor appears. Igor propels the chair
forward.</p>
<p><strong>59 med. shot igor and janitor</strong>: Igor, stopping,
points angrily at floor immediately surrounding some of the groups,
where shavings, excelsior and other packing material and debris are
scattered.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Does it take you all morning to sweep that
patch of sidewalk? Come, clean up this mess, and don’t try to sweep this
trash behind those screens. I want it removed.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Come, look, you fellows. You spend two days on
something that should have taken two hours.</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Say, listen, Old-Timer, they abolished
slavery in this country a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Is it slavery to do what you’re being paid
for? I have announced the opening of this museum tonight.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: If my curiosity is not too great, would you
mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: One of the maids-in-waiting for that
Elizabethan group.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And he isn’t struck dead! This man, he lives!
It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied
anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: That doesn’t seem so bad to me. What is wrong
with it?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a
great sculptor – A great sculptor. Look – this forearm is at least two
inches too long.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: But the composition as a whole – I’ve tried
to keep a sketchy freedom.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: If it is freedom to represent people with
limbs that don’t match – cripples – you have achieved your purpose.
Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of
freaks!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And this fellow! Look, I ask you … look what
this cobbler is doing!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: What is this? Are you so beautiful that you
make everything in your own likeness?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It’s a great mercy of Providence that this
fellow cannot hear. Look! Look at those claws! If I had those hands of
yours, I would show you the meaning of what you are trying to do. All
those beautiful things that were destroyed I could restore. It is a
great irony that you people without souls should have hands.</p>
<p><strong>61 ext. alley entrance rear of museum</strong>: We see a
truck backing in, and Sparrow, whom we first saw at Worth’s house,
climbs down from the driver’s seat and enters museum.</p>
<p><strong>62 int. museum</strong>: Igor is still speaking.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: But go on, go back to work. It is hopeless to
talk to such people.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Have you got it? Is it completed?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Yes, sir, it’s here on the truck, but it’s
pretty heavy – I’ll need help.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come
help Professor Darcey.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And hurry, please. This figure has still to be
mounted and dressed.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And now, my friend, you are to see something
that one can in truth describe as art. Professor Darcey doesn’t try to
keep freedom and sketchiness in his figures. He is an artist. He works
at home, hours, when such people as you are loafing. He is an
artist.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Shall we unpack it?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Get back to work! You will have plenty of time
to look at this.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Some mama!</p>
<p><strong>63 close shot of igor and sparrow</strong>: close to wall on
which hangs a photo of Igor as a young man standing beside statue of
Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It is exquisite – almost as beautiful as the
original. I hope one day to have you restore Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: I’d be glad to, Mr. Igor. I think I’ll have
somethin’ to tell you soon.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You have done well, and now I, too, have
something for you. Come.</p>
<p><strong>64 telephone booth near entrance of museum</strong>: Ralph
approaches and enters it. We see him dial for a number.</p>
<p><strong>65 close shot of hall phone</strong>: which rings and
Charlotte Duncan enters scene and answers it. We see that in stature and
face she is almost identical with the lost figure of Marie
Antoinette.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hello. Oh, hello, dear. I was just
thinking of you. … I was, too … no, I haven’t forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: You better not forget or I’ll cut you out of
my will. But listen, we’ll have to go somewhere close. I’ll only have a
few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: We’ll go to that Little Bohemian place… .
Yes, I like the food there…. All right, then, at twelve.</p>
<p><strong>68 int. living room of small apartment</strong>: A modestly
furnished room. There is a studio couch, right, on which Florence has
been sleeping. She straightens up, rubs her eyes, yawning, as Charlotte
turns away from phone.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Who was it? Penny ante?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yes, why?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or
did you invite him?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t be so sarcastic about
Ralph. He’s the sweetest kid I know.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: What are you laughing at?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I just had a picture of you telling a
landlady some day that you didn’t have the rent, but Ralph is awful
sweet.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t see any big-moneyed boys running
after you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I met one last night … all the money this
side of Peoria.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Did you? Where?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: In the can. The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton’s
little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know … and plenty of do-re-mi.
He’s in the jail-house now …</p>
<p><strong>69 close shot at hall door at tombs opening</strong>: Young
Winton comes through and is led away by turnkey.</p>
<p><strong>turnnkey</strong>: Come on. Bring your stuff, you’re goin’
out.</p>
<p><strong>70 int. office of the tombs</strong>: Two prosperous
middle-aged lawyers are seated near a desk talking to the official in
charge. One of them is presenting a court order for Winton’s release to
the official.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Mister, when I say I’m happier to see you
than I ever was to see anybody in my life, you know that it comes from
the heart. How are you, Mr. Gates?</p>
<p><strong>second attorney</strong>: Splendid, my boy, splendid. What do
you think you’ve been up to?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>first attorney</strong>: I hope your father accepts that
statement.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Is Dad here?</p>
<p><strong>second attorney</strong>: No. I talked to him long distance
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Was he pretty sore?</p>
<p><strong>first attorney</strong>: Well, he wasn’t exactly
overjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>second attorney</strong>: He said to get you out of trouble
and then hire someone to punch your head off.</p>
<p><strong>first attorney</strong>: Have you had lunch?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>first attorney</strong>: Well, come on, we’ll get something
to eat.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Hope to see you again soon.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: I hope you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’d give a year’s pay to work on that
puppy!</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: But you don’t shellac a guy when he can
put up a hundred thousand dollar bail.</p>
<p><strong>71 int. of taxi cab</strong>: Florence and Charlotte occupy
the cab. Charlotte seems indignant but Florence is amused.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Well, I don’t want to offend you, but,
frankly, it’s none of your business. I don’t interfere in your
affairs.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I don’t have any affairs. What do you
mean?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t think you could have a real
affair. You couldn’t care for anyone.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’ve been in love so many times my heart
is calloused … but I’ve never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic
isn’t my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: All right, you raise the kids – I’ll raise
the roof. I’d rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails
and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You would.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: He can look like a chimpanzee and act like
an igorot but he must have dough – plenty of dough.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You think money is the only requisite. It
happens that the poor people are happier.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Then marry Ralph … you’ll be the happiest
couple in the world.</p>
<p><strong>72. int. museum a shot at window</strong>: as Ralph,
consulting his watch, approaches window and looks out. Through window we
see a cab arriving. The two girls emerge from cab. Florence stops to pay
driver. As Ralph turns from window and starts for his hat and coat,
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A FULL SHOT. Ralph gets hat and coat and starts
toward door. Igor, who has been near the front of museum, wheels out in
front of Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And where do you think you are going, my good
friend?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: To lunch.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and
sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready
for the opening.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: But I have some friends waiting.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: That is unfortunate. They will have to
wait.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I will only be gone about half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: If you leave before the work is done, you will
be gone for a much longer period … you will be gone for good.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: All right, I’ll tell them. They’re right here
in front.</p>
<p><strong>73 ext. museum entrance close three shot</strong>: as Ralph
enters to Charlotte and, taking both her hands, kisses her lightly on
cheek. He speaks to Florence, who is standing beside Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Hello, Florence. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Fine, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Gee, honey-bunch, I’m sorry – I’m going to
have to disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Don’t worry – she’ll get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean,
dear?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious
to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>74 close-up florence</strong>: Florence stares at it,
puzzled. Then recognition dawns. Ralph enters PAST CAMERA and goes to
door. He is about to hurry into museum, when Florence detains him by a
hand on his arm. As she turns, we get the two in profile. Her expression
is one of excitement.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Listen, Genius, what’re the chances for me
to slip in and give this place the once over?</p>
<p><strong>igor’s voice</strong>: Ralph! Burton! Are you going to stay
out there all day?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I don’t know … the old man’s pretty peppery
right now. Why don’t you look in tonight?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: He might get some publicity out of it.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: No use. He’s a crab, I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Who? Old Santa Claus there? That’s easy
for anyone with my sex appeal. He’s a pushover. Watch me stand that old
dodo on his ear.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Nix, Flo – he won’t let you in and you’ll
only get me in Dutch.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Horsefeathers!</p>
<p><strong>75 int. museum</strong>: Igor sees a stranger entering with
Ralph and wheels chair rapidly toward them, speaking as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: No visitors allowed! You people will have to
get out!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Aw, listen, Beaver, I’m from–</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I don’t care where you’re from, young woman. I
have said no visitors!</p>
<p><strong>76 close-up charlotte from igor’s angle</strong>: We see
Charlotte, smiling slightly. Then DOUBLE-EXPOSED over her figure comes
the costume worn by Igor’s Marie Antoinette in the London museum. This
FADES IMMEDIATELY and we see Charlotte as she is, smiling at Igor.</p>
<p><strong>77 close-up igor</strong>: staring, fascinated. CAMERA DRAWS
BACK to include the group again and Ralph notices something strange in
Igor’s manner.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: What’s the matter, Mr. Igor?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Nothing – nothing at all, my boy. I should
like to meet your friend.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Why, certainly, sir. My fianc�e. Charlotte,
may I present Mr. Igor.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Delighted, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump,
my dear, I am very happy to know you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Although you would be amused if I were to tell
you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing
happened to me … … I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met
with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer,
probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come
to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who
does very excellent work?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’d love to, at any time.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, I’m a woman who craves nourishment.
Let’s ankle out of here and find a beanery. Come on, Moon-struck. Let’s
get going.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: We’ll be coming to the opening.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: At any time. You will always be welcome.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: So long, Pop, see you in jail.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Until this evening.</p>
<p><strong>78 ext. in front of museum</strong>: The two girls come from
building and are starting toward corner when Florence, seeing a cab,
signals to it. It swings in to curb.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Listen, Kid, I’m going to leave you flat.
I just thought of something and I’ve got to get to the office.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: But what about lunch?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’ll have it for supper. So long.</p>
<p><strong>79 int. museum</strong>: Hugo and Ralph return to work.
Sparrow stands beside Igor, who is addressing Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And you, young man, it is a matter to astonish
one. You are engaged to that beautiful girl, who was just here. You have
lived close to that beautiful creature, and yet you produce such
caricatures as this.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Charlotte is lovely, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Exquisite! But I am going to rechristen her
for you, my friend. She is not to be Charlotte any more, she is Marie
Antoinette.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: She is exactly like that statue?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: She is the soul of that statue.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: I wonder if I could have her pose for
me.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: What are you laughing at?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: He can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>80 editor’s office</strong>: Florence enters.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hello, Light-o’-my-life!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Come in, Prussic Acid. What’s on your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I want to see the original pictures of
Joan Gale.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up
all the art you have on Joan Gale.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Right, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>81 a long metal filing cabinet</strong>: A girl opens
compartment marked Ga. Running through files, she extracts a number of
photographs and walks out of scene.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill
it.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: So you can give me an argument and tell me
I’m wrong. Don’t be sil, Kid.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Thanks, Mattie.</p>
<p><strong>mattie</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I am right! I know I’m right!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Well, no one would ever suspect it. You
don’t sound right.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Listen, Jim – and if you wisecrack while
I’m talking I’ll crown you with the inkwell.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Jim, there’s a little hokey-pokey wax
museum opening up down on 14th Street.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Now don’t that call for an extra!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I asked you to keep your trap shut!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Well, you can’t blame a guy for getting a
little breathless with a scoop like that.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: All right, you poor baboon, you can guess
the rest of it!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: No kiddin’. What’s your idea?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Just this – I got a look at that dump a
little while ago and if they haven’t got a wax figure of Joan Gale in
that line-up, then I’m crazy.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: We’ll grant that.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go
from there? What of it?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to
you? Joan Gale’s body swiped from the morgue – Did you ever hear of such
a thing as a death mask?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I used to be married to one.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: And it came to life and divorced you. I
know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl’s
body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure … Bingo! …
Peddles it to this old skate down there!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Work that up into a comic strip and
syndicate it.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Come down to earth. Do you think they would
dare do anything like that? Don’t you think they’d know that figure
would be recognized? Shake your head real hard – you’ll be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: All right, Master Mind. But there’s
something cockeyed about that joint and I’m going to find out what it
is.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours
just blew up.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you
were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in
South America.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No kiddin’?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Almost certain.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Almost! I’ll still bet I’m right, and let
you write your own ticket.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: 83 EXT. STREET IN GREENWICH VILLAGE
Charlotte turns a corner and walks briskly TOWARD CAMERA, finally
turning into an apartment about a quarter of the way down the block. As
she disappears into the building, Sparrow appears around the corner and,
walking past the building she entered, stops and lights a cigarette,
inspecting the building immediately adjoining the apartment house. There
is a large For Sale or Rent sign on the front of the building, giving
the name and address of the agent handling the property. Sparrow goes to
a basement door and tries it, finding it locked. He is investigating one
of the windows when he sees that he is observed by a passer-by, and,
taking a notebook from his pocket, apparently copies the name and
address of the realty firm from the sign, and walks back in the
direction from which he came, whistling.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: 84 INT. LIVING ROOM WINTON’S BACHELOR SUITE
Worth is standing near door. Winton, crossing to him, hands him a sum of
money.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Well, that squares everything.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Yep. Everything settled.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Good. Well, I’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: I’m glad they didn’t hold you downtown.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: They didn’t have a leg to stand on. There’s
no case against me. It’s a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to
worry about.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Well, any time I can do anything for you
–</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: See you later. Good-by.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: So long. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hello. Is this Convict 87 thousand 412 –
and a half? – Ho-ho, don’t swoon. – This is the voice of the New York
Express broadcasting.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Oh, hello there. Say, I’m awfully glad you
phoned. I wanted to thank you for trying to cheer me up last night.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: How do you feel by now? … Yeh … Well,
listen, if you’re grateful, you can prove it and maybe do yourself a
good turn at the same time … Righto. Now at about 8:30 tonight you be in
your car at–</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. vacant building (wind) night</strong>: we saw Sparrow
inspecting. Florence passes in front of building and enters the
apartment house adjoining. CAMERA TRAVELS UP the front of the vacant
building to the roof.</p>
<p><strong>89 ext. roof of vacant building</strong>: We see a skylight
forced open, the Monster clambers out onto the roof and creeps
stealthily to edge, peering into lighted window of apartment house.
CAMERA FOLLOWS him. SHOOTING PAST him into room beyond, we see Charlotte
just putting the final touches to her toilette, preparing to put on
dress. The Monster, gauging the distance carefully, springs across space
separating buildings and clings to fire escape ladder like a huge
monkey. He leans out from ladder and is about to raise window sash when
the door of the room opens and Florence enters.</p>
<p><strong>90 int. apartment house room</strong>: Charlotte is
dressing.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Come on, beautiful, leap into that loin
cloth.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: There’s no hurry. It’s early.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I can’t convince the inner woman that we
can wait. She’s howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on
Santa Claus and the other dummies. I’ve only had a cup of coffee since
last night.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Why didn’t you eat last night?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don’t
step on it. I’m going to bow out on you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: What’s the rush? There’s no first act.
They’ll all be there and we don’t have to appear at any particular
time.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’m hungry. I’ll eat the first child I
see. And I’ve an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You wouldn’t get mixed up with that
little rotter, would you?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music
in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there’ll be a million dollar
tune.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: If you’re going to be indiscreet, I wish
you’d be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love
you and leave you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Yeah, but they leave you plenty.</p>
<p><strong>91 ext. roof of vacant building</strong>: The Monster has
returned to the roof of vacant building. He shows a blind fury at the
chance lost, and finally descends through skylight.</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: 92 EXT. MUSEUM Standing beside the door is
what appears to be a wax doorman in uniform. There are a number of
curious people looking at the lobby display.</p>
<p><strong>one of the visitors</strong>: Look at him now. Isn’t that as
real as life?</p>
<p><strong>spieler</strong>: Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. You
can’t afford to miss this exhibition that has thrilled the monarchs of
the world. For the first time, America is privileged to see the
collection pronounced by art lovers to be the finest in the world!</p>
<p><strong>93 int. museum</strong>: We hear music coming from a modern
victrola that changes records by itself. Igor, in wheelchair, is in
front of statue of Sir Walter Raleigh, kneeling on a spreading velvet
cloak on ground before the figure of Queen Elizabeth, who is smiling at
him graciously.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: The history of these figures, my friends, is
more interesting, perhaps, when I tell you that the originals were
destroyed twelve years ago in a fire in London, and restored only after
years of arduous toil. To reproduce the figures destroyed I spent years
training men to do the work that I can no longer do. Some of my workmen
have trained for years before I would let them undertake a single figure
of these groups that you have been looking at tonight.</p>
<p><strong>94 main entrance of museum</strong>: where Ralph is standing
near door to receive visitors. CAMERA MOVES UP TO A</p>
<p><strong>95 close shot of ralph</strong>: as Charlotte and Florence
enter, he takes a step forward to meet them.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Hello, hello. You’re late. Gee, that’s a
pretty dress. Have I ever seen that before?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, thank goodness, that’s settled.</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. street in front of</strong>: about four or five
buildings removed from entrance. Winton, in roadster, pulls up to curb
and looks up and down street expectantly. The barker is continuing his
announcement through megaphone.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. museum</strong>: Igor has ended his lecture, and
Ralph is escorting a group of visitors to the door.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: We hope you have enjoyed seeing these things
tonight. I hope you will tell your friends for we believe we have
something here of genuine public interest. Good night. Thank you. Call
again.</p>
<p><strong>98 close shot of florence</strong>: as she inspects the Joan
Gale figure. We see that all doubt has been dispelled and that she is
absolutely sure of her ground. Glancing about quickly, to be sure she is
not observed, she stealthily sticks a pin into the arm of the figure as
if convincing herself it is made of wax.</p>
<p><strong>99 shot of igor</strong>: As the last of the visitors are
leaving, Sparrow comes down behind him and, leaning over back of his
chair, whispers something to him. Igor turns sharply.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Are you sure of that? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: I’d know him anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Don’t lose sight of him. This is the most
important thing in my life.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I wouldn’t feel too disappointed at the
slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against
you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and
preparing to go to work tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Quite so. Quite so. And you, my little friend,
my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: But I think these things are
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: They are. My boy, I think you are right.
Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a
new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself.
You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we’ll close for the
night.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: I think I should have felt a little
discouraged tonight but now everything seems quite as it should be. You
know, to find just one person who appreciates my beautiful children here
changes everything for me. You must come some time in the morning when
there are no crowds about and I can give you more of my time.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Igor. I’ve been admiring
your works. Properly illuminated, they are more impressive than they
were this morning.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Yes, for a time I despaired of ever achieving
the same effects I had abroad. And then lighting came to my rescue.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I was particularly interested in that
group over there.</p>
<p><strong>igor’s voice</strong>: Yes, that one is very fine. Its drama
seems to interest people.</p>
<p><strong>florence’s voice</strong>: And this one, this single figure
of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p><strong>igor’s voice</strong>: That? Yes, that was the most recently
completed. It only arrived this morning.</p>
<p><strong>103 other corner of set</strong>: Ralph crosses in front of
Sparrow.</p>
<p><strong>104 shot of igor, florence and charlotte</strong>: Showing
length of museum and front entrance.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: You did this yourself?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: No, no, my friend. Never since these hands
were burned have I created anything. I have only been able to direct the
work of others.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: But who did it?</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Professor Darcey. He has been my hands for
years.</p>
<p><strong>105 close-up sparrow</strong>: He shifts nervously and laughs
self-consciously.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. cloakroom rear of museum</strong>: The deaf and dumb
man on scene as Ralph enters. Ralph, slipping into overcoat, scarf,
etc., slaps him on the back.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Good night!</p>
<p><strong>110 int. museum</strong>: The janitor comes up the steps from
Igor’s private workroom. He looks to the entrance to the street and we
see</p>
<p><strong>108 igor</strong>: just bidding good night to Florence,
Charlotte and Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>109 the janitor</strong>: glancing about and feeling that he
is unobserved, crosses quickly to the statue of Joan Gale and raises his
hand as though to caress it, when Sparrow appears from behind another
figure, grinning evilly.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>110 ext. street in front of museum</strong>: Sparrow comes
from museum and turns to the right out of picture, but calls to the
others who are still standing in doorway.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>111 ext. street near museum</strong>: Winton, seated in
roadster. He catches sight of Florence and sounds the auto horn. She
sees him and waves.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: You people will have to struggle along
without me. There’s my heavy date. No fouling in the clinches!</p>
<p><strong>113 ext. street winton’s car</strong>: Florence getting into
roadster.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hurry up! Tail that little runt down the
street!</p>
<p><strong>114 ext. street near museum charlotte and ralph</strong>:
CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they walk down the street.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I wish you’d cut her out and get a place by
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: But why? She’s the best friend I’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: She isn’t anybody’s friend, and I don’t like
you living with her. She’s a bad influence.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Nonsense. She’s one of the nicest girls I
know.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: What’s nice about her? … a hard-boiled little
gold digger.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I won’t let you say that!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Well, I do say it.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: She thinks it’s funny to talk the way she
does, but–</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Don’t kid yourself – she means it.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Are we going to have the same quarrel
over again?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I’m not quarreling, only …</p>
<p><strong>115 ext. street that sparrow is traversing</strong>: The car,
with Winton and Florence, loafing a block in the rear.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Don’t ask any questions right now. I think
we’re on the trail of hot news.</p>
<p><strong>117 ext. street charlotte and ralph</strong>: Their argument
has grown rather heated.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yes, certainly I would. And I’d be
terribly disappointed if you were stupid enough to object to it.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: You wouldn’t have said that before you met
her.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’d call it stupid at any time.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Well, that’s just how stupid I am. When you
go riding, it will be with me. And if it’s with someone else, you can
make it a permanent arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: So that’s the way it is?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: That’s the way I feel about it.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’m glad you told me. Good night,
Mr. Burton.</p>
<p><strong>118 ext. worth’s home</strong>: where we saw the mysterious
box delivered. Sparrow walks into picture and rings bell beside door on
street level. After a short pause, the door is opened and he disappears
through it. The car carrying Winton and Florence passes the house and,
going to the next corner, stops.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Don’t you think this would be as good a time
as any to break the news to me? What’s it all about?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, as one of the interested parties, I
suppose I might as well tell you the glad tidings. I think the fellow
we’ve been following had something to do with the robbery at the
morgue.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Now look here. It’s not up to us to do our
own detective work. I’ve had enough trouble over this matter. I don’t
want anything more to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Not even if it gives you a clean bill of
health?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Not even then. The police are the proper
people to conduct this affair. Now if you’ve got any suspicions I’ll
drive you to the nearest police station.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: What! And let every rag in town grab a
red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to
drive me around the corner and wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: I told you I didn’t want to mix in it.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: All right, brother. Then you can go to
some nice warm place, and I don’t mean California.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Please. I’m sorry. I’ll see it through. What
do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I told you what to do. Drive around the
corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the
place.</p>
<p><strong>119 int. worth’s office in house</strong>: Worth is seated at
the desk and Sparrow is standing in front of him. Worth is speaking.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: You’re yellow to the core – just yellow.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: No, I’m not. But I’ve had the uncanniest
feelin’ that someone’s been watchin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Nobody’s watching you. You’re yellow and your
nerves are gone. And let me tell you, I’ll do nothing to help your
nerves until it’s delivered, and you might as well get that through your
head.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: All right, then, I’ll phone.</p>
<p><strong>worth</strong>: Not over this phone, you fool! Get outside to
make the call.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Okay, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>120 ext. front of worth’s house</strong>: Florence comes in
and pauses and, glancing quickly up and down the street, runs down steps
to basement door, which she tries cautiously. Finding it locked, she
tries to peer through window, and finally tries lower sash, which opens.
She climbs through window to basement.</p>
<p><strong>121 ext. corner of street</strong>: where Winton is waiting.
The street door of house opens and Sparrow appears, starting away in
opposite direction from corner where Winton waits.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. basement room in worth’s house</strong>: Florence is
feeling her way about. She passes in front of mirror, sees her own
reflection, jumps back, startled, trips and sits down heavily on a pine
box that might contain a coffin. She gasps and springs to her feet,
terrified.</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. corner of street</strong>: Two plain-clothes men
approach Winton and address him.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Well, buddy, what’s the stall?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: I’m waiting for someone.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Yeah, for who?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: I don’t think it concerns you.</p>
<p><strong>second detective</strong>: Come on, Winton. Cut out the
bluffing. We’ve been watching you ever since you left The Tombs and
you’ve done some pretty suspicious things. Now what are you doing
here!</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: What have I done that’s suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: For one thing, you had a visitor at
your apartment today, not exactly the kind of a person I’d expect you to
entertain … a person who lives in this block.</p>
<p><strong>124 int. basement in worth’s house</strong>: Florence is
raising up from inspection of box when she sees the reflection of the
Monster in mirror and drops down behind the box. The figure of the
Monster glides into the room, stands as though listening for a moment
and then disappears in shadows. We hear someone ascending a flight of
rickety stairs.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: I’ve got to follow that fellow, I tell you.
I’ve reason to believe he knows what became of Joan Gale’s body. You’ve
no right to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Hang onto him, Paul. I’ll get the
other bird.</p>
<p><strong>126 close shot of basement window</strong>: Florence
clambering through and hurrying up the stairs. She is chattering with
fright. She gets to the top of the stairs, stands and sways, almost
falls.</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. corner of street long shot</strong>: Florence
running toward Winton and detective. CAMERA FOLLOWS her to a</p>
<p><strong>128 close shot of the three</strong>: Florence grabs Winton
by the shoulders and speaks hysterically.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I found it! I found the body!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What! What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: The body of Joan Gale!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Hello, Express. What’s the idea, trying
to outsmart the police?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’m not kidding. Joan Gale’s body is
packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing
down there.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Are you giving me this straight?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Don’t take my word for it. Get down there
yourself and give a look.</p>
<p><strong>129 close shot of sparrow</strong>: just coming under street
lamp. We hear a police whistle back of him. He turns, looks back,
terrified, and darts away at a quick run.</p>
<p><strong>130 close shot of officer</strong>: back of him, also
breaking into a run. We hear the sound of night stick being struck
against the sidewalk and police whistles from different directions and
at various distances.</p>
<p><strong>131 ext. street in front of worth’s house</strong>: The
detective, Winton and Florence are approaching. Several uniformed
policemen are running toward them from both intersecting streets. There
is an ad lib confused babble of voices as a number of curious people
approach the house from several directions.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Get this skirt out of here! We
don’t need hysterics. This thing has to be handled smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Listen, copper, get a load of this. While
you’re chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story … my
story. Consider yourself my assistant.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Whatever you are, you’re the only one of
it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: It happens that I’m the law.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: How quaint. But I can go any place you
can.</p>
<p><strong>132 int. office in worth’s house</strong>: We see Worth cross
the room and go through a door into an adjoining room. Then we hear a
doorbell ring rapidly. The Monster appears through the door Worth just
made an exit through, comes to the center of the room and stands
listening. Evidently they become tired of ringing, with no response, for
we hear them start to batter in the door. The Monster turns and vanishes
quickly the way he came. We hear the door shattered and, after a
moment’s pause, an officer appears stealthily, with drawn revolver,
around the hall door of the room.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Nobody here, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Well, take it easy. Let’s get some
light on here.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: A couple of you fellows get
upstairs!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. room adjoining worth’s office</strong>: There is
only the one entrance door, and the window of the room, when the officer
examines it with flashlight, appears to be flat against the brick wall
of the adjoining house. The room is empty.</p>
<p><strong>134 int. worth’s office</strong>: The detective, evidently
finding switch, has thrown on lights. He is talking to Florence and
Winton.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Can you give me a description of the
person you saw?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn’t
like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face,
from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an
African war mask.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You mean he was colored?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I don’t know what he was, but he made
Frankenstein look like a lily!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Well, there’s nothing on this floor.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Did you find anything up there?</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: No – not even any furniture up there – a
lot of old papers and junk.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Is there any rear entrance to this
place?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: I couldn’t find any.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Well, let’s give the basement a look.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. hall in worth’s house</strong>: The officers and
detective, with Florence and Winton, approach basement door and
cautiously start to descend steps to basement.</p>
<p><strong>136 int. basement of worth’s house</strong>: Two uniformed
men enter and flash lights everywhere. One of them tries door to rear
room. It opens. They turn back and shout.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: No one here.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: There she is! You’ll find Joan Gale in
that box.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: No – No – I – I – I don’t want to see
it.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Wait a minute! You stay right where you
are. Get that hatchet and open this up.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Oh, what wouldn’t I give for a slug of
gin!</p>
<p><strong>137 close-up of the box</strong>: its contents revealed to be
row on row of bottles of Scotch whiskey. An officer’s hand comes in and
lifts out a bottle. CAMERA DRAWS BACK TO</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Oh, gimme, gimme!</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: I ain’t done nothin’ – you ain’t got no
right to arrest me! What’s the charge against me?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Now, who owns this layout? Come on, spill
it.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: I don’t know. I was never here before
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You don’t know, oh … You don’t know
anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: No. All I know is there was a fellow named
Worth–</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Worth!</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Yes, sir, that was his name.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: That’s my bootlegger’s name! Was he a
heavyset fellow, with a stubby moustache?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Yes, sir, that’s the bird.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: I hope he delivered the stuff I paid him for
this afternoon. I told you it was a bootlegger you saw at my place.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Here, take this fellow in.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: I ain’t done nothin’. I wouldn’t even
deliver some stuff for him.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Hey, what do you think you’re doing? Put
that stuff back!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You
birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.</p>
<p><strong>139 large white bulb at entrance of police station</strong>:
SHOWING PRECINCT NUMERALS CAMERA PULLS BACK showing Winton seated in car
near entrance. A policeman is taking Sparrow up the steps. CAMERA
FOLLOWS them in.</p>
<p><strong>140 int. police sergeant’s office</strong>: Sergeant looks up
as policeman and Sparrow enter.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Junky, eh.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yeh – peddling. Put up your hands!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: A classy turnip. Must have dipped it.</p>
<p><strong>141 int. police captain’s office</strong>: Captain is seated
at desk. He is laughing heartily at Florence.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Imagine my embarrassment. The razzing I’m
going to get is nobody’s business. I tail a corpse and stumble on a box
full of spirits and not a dead one in the layout.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: They tell me your managing editor is
poison.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Poison! It takes a sturdy person to look
at him!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You want to talk to this fellow,
Captain?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: No, that’s all right, Denny. He’s a junky.
He’ll talk in a little while. Just lock him up.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yes, sir. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>142 int. horror chamber</strong>: We have not seen, up to
this point, anything that would give us a clue as to the location of
this room, which we now see for the first time. It is a stone room, with
apparently but one opening through a trap in the ceiling, which is
approached by a spiral stairway. There are several huge vats of some
steaming liquid, a few pieces of dilapidated furniture and an embalming
table in the center of the room.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, the season’s best catch is out there
waiting in his Rolls-Royce. I guess I’ll breeze.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Well, you ought to get a good laugh story
out of it, anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: What do you think this is?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Looks like a watch.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yeh, but do you know whose watch?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Let’s break down and confess – we don’t
know anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Judge Ramsey’s! That’s all!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: You’re not kiddin?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Where did this come from?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Just took it off that junky.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Great! Get him down here.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Now you’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>144 ext. street in front of police station</strong>: Winton
seated in car. Florence runs down steps and climbs into car.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: The office! There’s not much traffic – you
can step on it!</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: You like taking chances, don’t you!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: You go in for dangerous things.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Darned if I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>146 reverse angle through windshield</strong>: Showing
narrowly averted collision.</p>
<p><strong>florence’s voice</strong>: Slow down to ninety. I said the
office, not the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: No, really. I mean what I’m saying. I never
believed there were women like you in the world. You’re game and
decent.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: –and so determined to live that I’m going
to get out and take a taxi if you don’t watch where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: I suppose this is going to sound absurd.
I’ve only known you twenty-four hours, but I’m in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: It doesn’t usually take that long, but
I’ll forgive you – you were in a tough spot when I met you.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: No, really – I’m crazy about you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Oh, is that what caused it?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: You don’t believe me. You think I’m just
talking. Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: How much money have you got?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Heaven knows. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, that being the case, I’ll take it up
with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hold everything. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>148 int. editor’s office</strong>: The editor is just
finishing phone conversation.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: All right. Give that a four-point head. No,
that’s all it’s worth … All right, you can play it up later if …</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Mit me, kid. I’ve got a classic.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: You here again like an evil spirit to mar my
happiness?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: This one’s a story, but I’m not going to
tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: What do you mean – haywire? You start out
after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You
start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You’re grand!
I’m for you! Stupendous!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Say, you’re always razzing everything I
do, but this is one time I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Go on, little girl, take your troubles
somewhere else. I don’t feel like talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: What goofy idea have you got now? Don’t tell
me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’m going to make you eat dirt, you soap
bubble! I’m going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: 149 INT. POLICE STATION CAPTAIN’S OFFICE
Sparrow is seated in the center of the room, quivering for want of the
drug. A number of detectives, in shirt-sleeves, evidently worn and tired
themselves, are circling about the room.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: So you found the watch in a taxi
cab three months ago. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was
layin’ there on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Where were you going when you got
in that cab?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: I don’t remember. Not so very far–</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Don’t remember what day that was,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: No, sir. About three months ago.</p>
<p><strong>second detective</strong>: Remember what kind of a cab it
was?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: No, sir. Just a cab.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: You didn’t happen to be going to
Worth’s place, did you?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: No, sir, I’m sure it wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: You used to go to Worth’s place a
whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: Well, maybe it was. I don’t remember. You
got to do something for me, I can’t stand it any longer – I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>one of the detectives</strong>: He’s beginning to break now –
he’ll talk pretty soon.</p>
<p><strong>other detective</strong>: I don’t know about that – he’s been
begging all night.</p>
<p><strong>other detective</strong>: Nearly half past eight. I never saw
a junky hold out like this before.</p>
<p><strong>151 ext. museum the next morning</strong>: The people passing
are of the type who would be hurrying to report for some office or
clerical job around nine o’clock. Charlotte walks into picture, glances
up and down street as though looking for someone, then glances at watch
and goes to museum door, peering through panel. She tries the door and
finds it open and enters.</p>
<p><strong>152 int. wax museum long shot</strong>: Nobody is in scene.
Charlotte enters, looks about.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Ralph! Are you here?</p>
<p><strong>153 close shot near portieres</strong>: Charlotte is near
portieres which conceal door to workshop at rear. She draws curtains
aside and steps into workshop.</p>
<p><strong>154 int. workroom at rear</strong>: Hugo is at work.
Charlotte has advanced several steps into the room before she becomes
aware of his presence. She stops, startled.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I beg your pardon – Is Ralph here?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’m looking for Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh! Mr. Igor! – I’m so glad you’re here –
I don’t know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me
by accepting my invitation of last night.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: No – I – wanted to speak to Ralph. We had
a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Oh, you children, you happy children. You’ve
quarreled and now you’re going to be friends again. And that is as it
should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: But it was really my fault.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And he will probably demand the life of anyone
who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault … He should be along
very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially
if it is your fault … While you’re waiting for your friend, would you
like to see some new figures I have downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I’m terribly
ashamed. I shouldn’t have put you to so much trouble.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the
strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me – to see others enjoy
the beauty I used to create. My footing is not too secure.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, let me help you, please.</p>
<p><strong>155 shot photographed through open door of basement</strong>:
WORKSHOP TOWARD STAIRS We see Charlotte and Igor finish descending
steps.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Thank you – thank you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. workroom</strong>: Igor instantly drops his crutches
and sweeps Charlotte into his arms, lifting her clear off the floor.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Let me go! Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: We have found immortality, you and I. You must
not be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Ralph! Ralph!</p>
<p><strong>157 int. workroom close shot</strong>: Igor, kneeling beside
the girl, speaks.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Poor, frightened child. The only common
objective of all living things is death … and she is afraid.</p>
<p><strong>158 ext. front entrance of museum</strong>: Janitor is
sweeping walk. Ralph comes into picture, glances into museum and,
assuming that he is the first to arrive, takes a last puff on a
cigarette before entering. He throws it away and starts to enter when we
hear Florence’s voice off scene.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Hey – Ralph!</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: What are you people doing out in the middle
of the night?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: I’m after news, as usual. I wonder if it
would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I guess so. But wouldn’t it be better for you
to wait until the old man’s here?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you a secret. I kinda like
the old gent and I’m trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out
of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that’s a side issue –
something I do on my own time.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Gee, that’s great. After the bad opening that
night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told
him about it?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: No. I wanted to do it without saying
anything. I think he’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>160 ext. museum a shot of winton’s car</strong>: A policeman
walks up to car and calls over to group.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Whose car is this?</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Well – You can’t park there. You’ll have
to take it down the street.</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: Okay, brother. Flo, I’ve got to find a place
to park. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Don’t deceive me or I’ll come back and
haunt you.</p>
<p><strong>161 int. museum</strong>: Florence takes from her bag a
photograph of Judge Ramsey.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE-UP OF PHOTOGRAPH:Showing bust picture
of man whose features are strikingly like those of Voltaire, although he
has a moustache, wears glasses and is dressed in modern clothes.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Ralph, come here a minute, will you?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Better cut that out. That’s what happens to
girls who bite their nails. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Look at this photograph, will you?</p>
<p><strong>162 int. police station captain’s office</strong>: Sparrow
suddenly springs to his feet, screaming.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: All right – I’ll talk! I’ll tell you what I
know! Ramsey was murdered because he looked like Voltaire! Because he
looked like Voltaire! You want to know what became of him! He’s a statue
– a silly wax statue!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You killed him! Come on with the rest of
it. You killed him!</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: No – I didn’t. It was Igor at the
waxworks.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: But you were in on it – you worked for
him.</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: No – the only thing I did for him was to
keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested
me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You lie!</p>
<p><strong>sparrow</strong>: It’s Igor at the Wax Museum! You’ll find
your judge embalmed in wax! He’s a statue of Voltaire, with all the
other corpses! The whole place is a morgue – do you hear? – a
morgue!</p>
<p><strong>163 int. horror chamber</strong>: Charlotte is crouched,
terrified, in a corner, while Igor, now a raving maniac, tries to calm
her.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: My child, why are you crouched there? So
pitifully afraid. Immortality has been the dream, the inspiration of our
kind, and I am going to give you the only guarantee of immortality you
have ever had.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Please, oh, please, I haven’t done
anything to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: And I have no desire to hurt you. You will
always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as
lovely as you are now.</p>
<p><strong>165 int. horror chamber</strong>: The Monster is pleading
with Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: My child, my child, if you will just listen to
me, then you will not be afraid. Don’t you understand, dear, that I love
you? Don’t you know that at times when I have wanted to die – I could
not die because I had not saved you. And now you are here, to be given,
a thing of delight, to all the world. I am trying to grant you
immortality.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You fiend! You fiend!</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: Oh, my Marie Antoinette, you must not say that
to me. There was a fiend, of that you may be sure. There was a fiend –
and this is what that monstrous person did to me.</p>
<p><strong>166 close shot of charlotte</strong>: as she drops her head
on her knees, sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>167 ext. police station</strong>: Officers pour out and climb
into two cars. They commandeer a couple of taxis and all race down the
street, with sirens screaming.</p>
<p><strong>168 int. horror chamber full shot</strong>: Igor standing
over Charlotte pityingly, wringing his hands. Then he whirls toward
curtained cabinet in rear.</p>
<p><strong>igor</strong>: You! … You did this! These terrible broken
hands – this terrible living dead man – for twelve years, twelve awful
years, has hunted for the fiend, the fiend who brought us here tonight!
But the account is closed. He is here!</p>
<p><strong>169 int. museum</strong>: Florence and Ralph hear scream
repeated and rush to stairs. CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they run to stairs
and start down. They find door locked. Ralph throws his full weight
against the door several times. When the door shatters he stumbles into
room.</p>
<p><strong>170 int. workshop</strong>: They look around, startled. It is
apparently untenanted. As they stand looking at each other in
bewilderment, the scream is repeated. Ralph gestures, "Wait a minute,"
then, with emphasis:</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: It did come from under our feet!</p>
<p><strong>171 shot from ralph’s angle</strong>: We see Charlotte on
operating table. The Monster is stirring a huge vat of boiling wax.
Hearing the trap door open, he looks up, sees Ralph and screams his
rage. Ralph passes CAMERA and starts downstairs toward him.</p>
<p><strong>172 int. workshop close shot of florence</strong>: Standing
at trap, looking down, horrified. She whirls and dashes, screaming,
upstairs toward the museum.</p>
<p><strong>173 int. horror chamber</strong>: Ralph and the Monster
having a furious struggle, the Monster attempting to force the boy
backward into one of the vats of boiling wax.</p>
<p><strong>174 int. museum</strong>: Florence appears at head of stairs
from below, just as Winton enters door. She runs to him.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Come on! Quick! Help!</p>
<p><strong>winton</strong>: What is it? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Don’t ask any questions. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>175 int. horror chamber</strong>: The Monster succeeds in
striking Ralph over the head with some heavy object. As Ralph sinks,
stunned, to the floor, the Monster dashes up the steps.</p>
<p><strong>176 shot from horror chamber camera tipped up
sharply</strong>: Showing trap at head of stairs. When the Monster has
negotiated three-quarters of the ascent, we see Winton appear in the
trap door above, blocking his escape. Now we hear the screaming of the
sirens of approaching police cars. Seeing his passage barred, the
Monster, no longer coherent, stands jabbering like an infuriated ape at
the man above him.</p>
<p><strong>177 int. workshop</strong>: Winton at edge of trap, looking
down, horrified.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Do something! Can’t you? Do something!</p>
<p><strong>178 shot upward from horror chamber</strong>: As Winton draws
from trap, the Monster starts to advance. A policeman in uniform appears
above him, with drawn revolver.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Get ’em up! Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>179 full shot</strong>: We see Ralph, who has recovered,
gather Charlotte in his arms and whirl her so that his body would shield
her from a possible stray bullet. The Monster, who is backing, still
defiant, before the policeman, misses his footing and, with an agonizing
scream, whirls downward into a vat of boiling wax.</p>
<p><strong>180 ext. street in front of museum</strong>: A great crowd is
collecting. The police are holding them back. They lead the janitor and
Hugo from the building.</p>
<p><strong>captain of detectives</strong>: I don’t think these mugs mean
anything, but take them around and get a statement from them.</p>
<p><strong>181 ext. street winton’s car</strong>: as Florence and Winton
scramble in.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Come on, pal, get me uptown! Don’t stop
for lights – don’t stop for–</p>
<p><strong>182 ext. street in front of museum</strong>: Ralph is leading
Charlotte, still hysterical, through door.</p>
<p><strong>183 int. composing room new york express</strong>: Before the
room is clearly discernible, we hear the clatter of typewriters. A scene
of feverish activity. Copy boys are dashing back and forth. The place is
seething with excitement. Florence, seated at machine nearest CAMERA, is
typing frantically. She evidently just completes the last line of story,
jerks sheet from machine and hands it to a copy boy.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Take it away, Hennessy.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: My hat’s off to you, kid. What a
scoop!</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: This story makes history.</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: Congratulations, Flo. You’ve got the
other papers bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Now I’m going to scramble this egg.</p>
<p><strong>184 int. editor’s office</strong>: He looks up as Florence
enters room. She is gloating.</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Well, Poison Ivy, how about it? Was that a
story?</p>
