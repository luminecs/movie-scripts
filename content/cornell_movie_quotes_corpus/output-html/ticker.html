<p><strong>rice</strong>: Know what the problem is, kid? You’re too ugly
to get propositioned.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Look who’s talking, old man.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: C’mon, it’s a quiet night.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Next week we work the park.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze
detail.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: You will, one day at a time. I’ll be old and
grey when it happens…</p>
<p><strong>bag lady</strong>: A small gift, sir, for the Queen …</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Here you go, your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>bag lady</strong>: Thank you, officer.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: So what’ll you do? After they give you the
gold watch.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Hell, I got a gold watch… it just don’t work.
Maybe they’ll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You don’t fish.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: How hard can it be? The grand kids been
buggin’ me about taking them camping.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You outta the city… that’s a fish out of
water. What’s with all this family talk lately, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: One of these days you’re gonna get tired of
fighting the shit. When that happens, you’ll wish you had family.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: No thanks. I got close but it never woulda
worked.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Why don’t you just shoot it and put it out of
its misery?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What are you talking about, it’s purring
like a kitty.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: I thought you said what’s-her-name’s brother
was going to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: She didn’t work out, had to cut her
loose.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: What was it this time?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: She wanted to cook me breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: We’re vice, I didn’t see no pimps or hookers
in that van. But if you’re so gung-ho, we’d best call it in for some
back-up.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Nah, let’s just take a look-see.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Ow! Son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yeah, just a nick …</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Freeze! Police!</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>earring</strong>: We gotta get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Tell them to drop it - now!</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: You have no idea how sorry you’re going to be.
Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Mike…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Take your time… one day at a time, kid…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: It don’t work-</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: Ain’t that a shit–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, Reilly, Captain’s looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Prints?</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: Nothing so far.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What about the ballistics report?</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: Lab’s backed up, we’re still waiting for
it.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Captain…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Reilly, what the hell happened out there?
Why didn’t you call for back-up?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Sir, I–</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I want to work this.</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: You’re vice, not homicide. Besides, you
don’t have the experience and you’re too personally involved.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: But sir–</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You know the rules. You’re off the street
`til I.A.D. clears the investigation. Now go home and clean yourself up,
get some rest…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She won’t talk. Look at this shit, no I.D.,
nothing…</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Bracelet she was wearing.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to
blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: Maybe she knows your old man.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Okay, kid. Run this down to the Cave.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I’m looking for the Bomb Squad.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: They’re not here.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: And you are…?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Officer Reilly, vice.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: There out on a call, perhaps I can help
you-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: -Where?</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But,
I-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Bomb Squad.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Smell anything, Schnoz? Me, neither.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Shhh, I hear something….</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Who the heck’re you?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You the Bomb Squad?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: No, we’re terrorists, stay back or we’ll
blow.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: We’re a bit busy at the moment, I’ll give you
a statement in a few minutes if we’re still alive.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Reilly, Vice. I-</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Schnoz says it’s loaded. Good boy,
Schnozzie.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Alright boys, look close. Let’s assess.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Whadaya think, “boy” or “girl”?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: It’s a “girl” !</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: That guy’s wife must be pretty pissed off to
play a trick like that.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in
case.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Who’s in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: He is!</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Look, it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Make an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: It’s about this.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Off a girl’s wrist. A suspect…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: High-grade det cord. This girl, either she’s
got strange taste in jewelry or she’s into serious demolition.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Fire in the hole!</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Sorry about that. That’s an inch of the
stuff, imagine what the whole thing’d do.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Hey wait a minute-</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Vice… Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: That’d be some explosive pussy he’s got his
hands on.</p>
<p><strong>earring</strong>: They’re holding her downtown.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: What about the cop?</p>
<p><strong>beard</strong>: If you’d let me waste him.</p>
<p><strong>earring</strong>: What if she talks?</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: She won’t.</p>
<p><strong>beard</strong>: I say we split town. Come back to this job
when things cool. We’ve got other contracts - Denver, Seattle…</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: I want her back and we do the job.</p>
<p><strong>beard</strong>: I thought we agreed, the personal can’t
interfere with the professional.</p>
<p><strong>earring</strong>: Besides, we’re on a schedule and the cops
won’t let her go.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Unless we make them.</p>
<p><strong>earring</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Captain-</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Captain, line one!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I thought I told you–</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: He says it’s important, something about the
Rice shooting.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Winters.</p>
<p><strong>swan’s voice</strong>: I said release the girl or alot of
people are going to die.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Wait, what do you mean–?</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: A ticking bomb…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: It’s detonation cord, for a bomb.</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: It’s a bluff. The guy’s full of
crap.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We can’t take the chance. Ring down to the
Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Goddamit, Reilly–</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I know you’re anxious to get back but… just
stay out of homicide’s way or I’ll have you classifying fingerprints,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: No, honey, I’m fine. Yeah, well, you’re
welcome. You deserve flowers more often.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Bev, you’re the greatest…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Hey, I’m next.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: Hey, that’s the guy-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: We just got a bomb threat upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Alright, let’s check it out.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: We can start in the area where the robbery
occurred.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Vice cop on a homicide?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Captain assigned me to assist you.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Assist? What the hell you know about tickers
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Easy, guys.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: When you need us, you love us, when you
don’t, we’re shunned by the rest of the department.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: We’ve got one hour. Are you coming or
not?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Those vice cops, around all that pussy, so
pent up.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Call upstairs, see what you can find out.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin
down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let’s hope they’re
all talk.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>earring</strong>: Twenty after.</p>
<p><strong>beard</strong>: Swan, it’s no use. Look, we can still make
Houston–</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>earring</strong>: Hey, beautiful, can I buy you some bangers
and mash? Pint of Guiness?</p>
<p><strong>knockout</strong>: Fuck off, pal.</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: Eight dead, so far.</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You touch me again and–</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: And what, you’ll shoot me? Hey, don’t
mistake me for one of your partners, I’d like to make retirement in one
piece.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: Son-of-a-bitch… my nose… This fuck-up is
interfering with-</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Reilly, what’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Sir…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I thought I told you–</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: He’s with us.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Yeah, he’s helping us work up a profile on
this thing.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Hope you don’t mind, Captain, might help us
catch these guys that much sooner. Coming?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Go ahead, kid.</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: I’m filing charges against that
mother-</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton
up your nose.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What was-? Why…?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: That cop who bought it… you didn’t tell us he
was your partner.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We’ve lost brothers too, we know what that’s
like.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Let’s get something straight. We’re doing you
a favor. You’re not exactly a guy we want around explosives.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: This isn’t bumper cars, it’s brain surgery.
You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Now wait just a fucking-</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Be cool around my men, they don’t trust
strangers. And try not to swear so much, it’s unattractive.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: By the way, I’m Glass. This is T.J., and
Pooch.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Mike Reilly.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Uh-huh…</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: That there’s Schnoz, mascot and ace bomb
sniffer. Say hi, Schnozzie.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Flame racer, partial P.C.L. See this wave
pattern? Definitely self-contained.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil …</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What kind of bomb was it?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Device.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: We don’t use the b-word. Bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: So you’re the “Device Squad”… and you defuse
“devices”?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Treat. We treat devices.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Anything else I should know?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Don’t push it, slick.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Pooch, can you move it?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Yes, baby, yes …</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Scorch marks… looks like they used silly
putty.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: C4, plastic explosive.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Helluva fuck factor.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Hey, check this out?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Lemme see that.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Computer device?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Unlikely. Probably, cash register or
something.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I’ll get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Let’s go, we gotta jump on him the second
he calls again.</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain
said to leave it alone, but just remember, I’m watching you.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I’m sorry, detective, but you’re just not my
type.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Captain, it’s him!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Winters here.</p>
<p><strong>swan’s voice</strong>: Don’t make me send another.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Look, we’re prepared to talk, what do you
want–?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Where’s the girl? The one I brought in.</p>
<p><strong>booking officer</strong>: Upstairs, interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>bored cop</strong>: Three hours. She’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tough? Tough is “Fuck you, where’s my
lawyer?”. This chick doesn’t say boo.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Bupkiss. Sorry about Rice.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Captain said I could give it a crack.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She ain’t no hooker. This is a murder
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: She was my collar. Maybe I’ll get lucky.
But, if you got a problem with that, talk to the Captain.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll be in the can.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You remember me.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Let me be very clear about this. The police
won’t let you go. When your boyfriend realizes this, I have a feeling a
lot of innocent people are going to die. Kids, families. I know you
don’t want that to happen.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: We missed you, where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints
here!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Awright! How bout you, Glass, how’s that chip
shaking?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Glass, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: I was wrong… this didn’t come from any cash
register.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Whadaya mean?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: It’s from an IRA.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: IRA - instant retirement account.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in
existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First
showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One
of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less
complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: She’s not talking. But, she could be. So,
obviously, you’ve seen one of these devices before?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Only once, at Redstone.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Where…?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: That’s one more time than any of the rest of
us have seen it.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Shit. We’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Relax, Pooch, it’s just a ticker, it’s not
personal.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Let’s face it, we all knew it would happen
sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that’s better than we
are …</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: Stop it…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: And what’s he doing to help?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Shut up, T.J.!</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: Be nice Pooch!</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: All of you, shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Nice performance back there. Where’d you
learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Hey, look–</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: No you look, mister! First, you don’t go
calling my men names. It’s bad for morale. Second, us “punks” happen to
know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever
did.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Oh yeah? Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: The place has already be combed. Forensics
pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Then let’s go see what they missed.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: So what were they doing here?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I don’t know. You tell me?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: An abandoned machine shop… nice place to
build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect
hideout.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You mentioned something called Redstone.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Redstone’s the army training center in
Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about
tickers.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Cream of the crop, huh? You?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Top of my class at West Point, thank you very
much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to
build devices… second half, we’d take them apart. Everything from
firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Sounds like terrorist heaven.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: There were a few guys in my class with names
like John Smith, Bill Jones. I’d see them up ahead in the hall, call
their name, but they wouldn’t turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they’d
always disappear after the first half of the course.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Just how easy is it to build a… device?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: With a little training, you could go into a
house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something
that’d finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn’t you ever watch
MacGyver?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Girl was here. The guy in charge was over
there with one of his men, the other one was back there.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies
that’re afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people.
That’s why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone
callers.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Except they’ll blow you up if you don’t play
along.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of
baloney. They’re into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is
that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants,
then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of
creating the wildest device ever… and they love the carnage.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: This is where the van was parked.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Then, it’s gotta be here somewhere …</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Look, it’s a longshot…</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: No question, it was definitely the one used to
l-light the butt. Finger pressure suggests a male, average build,
height… no prints, trace of nylon fiber… he wore a glove.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: This is strange.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of
explosive?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of
these things could lead in several directions, but together …</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Ka-Boooom.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: They make bowling balls out of vulcanized
rubber …</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Resin…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Lane oil…</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: A bowling alley.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint,
Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You mean you just–? … You keep a record of…
matches?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line
of work.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: “Punks”, huh?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling
alleys they supply in this area.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Pooch, why don’t you e-mail your buddies at
Langley and on the other side of the pond, see if any IRAs been popping
up lately?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: We work fast enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: T.J., what’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: My first undercover assignment. I gotta look
good, right?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: So what’re we looking for?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Someone who smokes French cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: In this crowd? It’s gonna be Marlboros,
Camels, and maybe a few Kools.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: How long are we going to stay?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: `Til we get a better lead.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Unsolved bombings in the last year… Boston,
New York, Philadelphia… but no real match</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Political.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the
targets can actually be linked to government, political or special
interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies.
Some insured, some not.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What not bad. You’ve got a series of bombs,
devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs,
who may or may not be linked.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Well… it’s more than we had ten minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I got a friend over at Scotland Yard who’s
gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the
rightwingers are circulating over here. Bev’s following up on the
briefcase manufacturers, too.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Pooch, you’re up. Rack `em.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: How’re you guys doing?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: It’s a small fraternity, everyone knows
everyone. I’m always recruiting. Pooch is ex- D.O.D., military expert…
claymores, grenades. He played linebacker at Boston College, worked a
K-9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad… great nose, lousy fingers, we
try to keep him away from the tickers. T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas
A&amp;M engineering degree. Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out
we were both monitoring the same groups. Bev is the natural born hacker,
we stole her from dispatch. She had the Cave reorganized and
ultra-high-tech in two months. Captain has no idea how much hardware
she’s “found” for us.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You guys seem pretty tight.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: We’ve gotta be. In this business, you don’t
exactly make alot of outside commitments.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Why do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: I don’t know, it’s strange… it’s not the best
career path, but when you get the bug, there’s nothing you can do about
it. See, when you beat one of these things…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Lesbians.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Looks like Pooch’s doing okay.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: He’s married, he don’t even know what a
lesbian is.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: There he goes. He was here the whole
time.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Say, thanks for the back up–</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: He set one, the son-of-a…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Clear the area, please.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You heard him, get the fuck away, it’s a
bomb!</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Alright. Let’s assess.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Fuck factor ten.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Okay, I’m going in, nobody breathe.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: So cut both.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: One shuts it down, one turns arms it.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Which one’s which?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: I don’t know. There’s an old saying, when in
doubt, cut the yellow wire.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: No, I’m with you.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Is this a great job or what?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Nothing. Nothing traceable.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: I don’t know, honey. I’ll see. No,
everything’s fine, it was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: What do ay say?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Meg’s lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Got work to do, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: In case you change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Report on the case so far.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You know after a shooting I would normally
take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it
was clean.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: But from now on, any leads on this case go
to Pluchinsky. He’s primary investigator and you are unofficially
assigned to the Bomb Squad… you and your new friends are not to be
playing detective any more. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: To recap, a gunman carrying what police
described as a phony bomb was shot and killed less than an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>beard</strong>: She talked.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: More coffee, T.J.?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: No thanks, Meg. Hawed Pooch ever get so
lucky?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Mr. Reilly?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Mike. No thanks, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can Uncle Teej tuck us in?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: C’mon, champ, I’ll even give you a
piggyback.</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: Goodnight Uncle Charlie, goodnight Uncle
Mike.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: `Night…</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: How long were you hooked?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: You don’t have to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no
back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess,
if only for a second.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I know. I was working a drug ring, deep
cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn’t a cop
anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on
the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old
vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised
Captain Winters he’d look out for me.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Your partner?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I guess I didn’t realize how much I needed
him. He kept me straight. It’s been tough every second since.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I terrible with mechanical things.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: No you’re not, you just don’t understand
them. Here, do what I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: It’s working.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Congratulations, you just built your first
ticker.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Okay, hit it.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We’ve created a monster.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Any word?</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Don’t bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: How’s the print coming?</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: One partial from the handle matches the suspect
from last night. Name’s Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the
works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or
CIA… still waiting for Interpol.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: Coffee, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: No thanks, Bev.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: Yes, sir. He’s here. I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Yes … no, of course not but … yes, sir, I
understand.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: She’s refused to say a word to anyone. What
made you think you could get her to talk?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I didn’t. But I had to try.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Reilly, I think I’ve shown that I’m a
patient man. Rice was your biggest fan and I’ve tried to honor him by
giving you some slack. But you are very close to running out of
slack.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I read your report. Impressive. I’d say
it’s got detective written all over it. But… you cross the line one more
time… you’re gone. Are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll be outside.</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: My name is Mary Jordan. We were hired to
take out some industrial sites. Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: But they weren’t all insured.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Cover. It was suppose to be abandoned
buildings, y’know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted
us…We were checking to make sure there weren’t any vagrants around.
Scare them away.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are
called Taylor and Leveau.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Taylor’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There is a motel downtown, near the Machine
Shop… the Suncrest. Room 138.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s my brother…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Then why tell me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: People are dying.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Ex-girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>bag lady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: No, of course not… well, thanks anyway. Here
you go, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>bag lady</strong>: On second thought, maybe I did.</p>
<p><strong>bag lady</strong>: Lemme see… yeah, here it is, 11:18 this
morning. Very disrespectful. He used to drive a van, but he got a new
car. You want the license number?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: You’re beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: We’re back in business!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ran the license plate - car was rented early
this morning from a Hertz office downtown.</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: Alex Swan - demolitions expert, trained
at Redstone, dropped out, freelanced in the middle East for awhile, then
disappeared, no criminal record. The other one, Leveau, is French
Canadian, he’s a mercenary, record in half a dozen countries.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Get out an APB, now!</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: … suspects driving a dark green Ford
Grenada, license number one Two Eight Michael Vincent Edward …</p>
<p><strong>beard</strong>: We’ve got company.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Glass, there they are. Pooch right in front
of you, you got <code>em, you got</code>em.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Dispatch, this is Bomb Squad. Suspects sighted
on Fern Street, two blocks from HQ. In pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Roger that. All available units…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Police, freeze!</p>
<p><strong>pooch</strong>: Oh… damn.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good
man. We don’t have time to give you a break right now, we’re going ahead
and-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: My God, you’re going to use her, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Glass, you’re to stand by with your
team.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I promised her she’d be safe.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: It’s our only option.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: It won’t work, he’ll know it’s a trap…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Reilly, you’re done for now. What the hell
were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They
had no business-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You’ve been at the center of two suspect
fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I’ll need your badge and
your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Glass–!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s him!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Winters here.</p>
<p><strong>swan’s voice</strong>: You motherfuckers, you don’t learn, do
you?!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We’re prepared to talk-</p>
<p><strong>swan’s voice</strong>: Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>tracer</strong>: 15…</p>
<p><strong>swan’s voice</strong>: You have exactly thirty minutes to
release the girl where you found her.</p>
<p><strong>tracer</strong>: Twelve …</p>
<p><strong>swan’s voice</strong>: Thirty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>tracer</strong>: Nine …</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: How do we know you’ll keep your word?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Okay, let’s move!</p>
<p><strong>pluchinsky</strong>: Get out and go to the machine shop -</p>
<p><strong>wino</strong>: She’s out of the bag.</p>
<p><strong>wino</strong>: Position Four. Turning on Elm.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: Six. She’s crossing to Main.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Seal the building! Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: We have contact. Black Camaro-</p>
<p><strong>truck driver</strong>: -license number HQW-256.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Alex-</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: I know. I warned them.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Security.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: C’mon, cowboy, you’re next.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Okay, what’s it gonna be? I got China White,
Snow Flake, Ivory Pearl…</p>
<p><strong>reporter on tv</strong>: We’re coming to you live near the
scene of that latest, explosion that ripped through a downtown alley
less than half an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Hey, asshole …</p>
<p><strong>reporter on tv</strong>: Despite growing fears and talk of a
coverup, police have sealed off the area and are refusing to comment
about fatalities, or the rumor that terrorists may be involved.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Hey, I’m talking to you–</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: You hungry? We could get something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nothing… just tired.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why are we stopping here?</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: We’re moving’ on. I have to pick up the
supplies. Just two little boxes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No… No more killing.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Alex, please.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Stay in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Operator.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Get me the police!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Is this an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes! Please, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant’s voice</strong>: Police, Sergeant Doyle
speaking.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please, I need help, my name is–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant doyle’s voice</strong>: Whoa, slow down, lady. Now
what’s that again?</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Who are you calling, sis?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What? Nobody, I-</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Alex, please-</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Shut up! Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant doyle’s voice</strong>: Sergeant Doyle, Metro P.D.
Look, what’s going on–?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey–?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: C’mon, move it.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher voice</strong>: All units, 211 reported at 8th and
Sycamore. Suspect is a Caucasian male, armed with an automatic weapon,
last seen heading east with female hostage in a U-Haul truck …</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Dispatch, this is Reilly.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher voice</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher voice</strong>: Aren’t you on suspension?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher voice</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.’s voice</strong>: T.J. here.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: T.J., it’s Reilly, put Glass on!</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Where you guys at?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Driving in circles, waiting for-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Catch that alert? That’s him in the
U-Haul.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Cuz he got the girl, now he’s leaving
town.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Should we head for the Interstate?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Would you?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: No, I’d slip out past the hotel district,
behind Greyhound…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand
Hotel. Cut him off.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: All units, suspect spotted heading down
alley behind Grand Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Reilly, what the hell are you-?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Fire me later. Close in and we got the
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Pull back. You’re only an observer.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Reilly, what’s happening? Reilly! Reilly!
Do not engage. We’re five minutes-</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: We’ll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry
up!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Reilly! He’s loaded!</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: I want out, right now. Or the whole city block
is gone.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Reilly, he’s got enough to do it.</p>
<p><strong>swan</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Take him!</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Hold on to that thing tight.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Fuck factor?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Off the scale.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Can you hold it?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Talk to me. Let’s assess.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: C’mon, talk to me! We can do it!</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: He has a timer going as back-up, in case we
got a hold of the remote. Okay… first, run your fingers along the edges,
feel for a sensor.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Good, now the other side.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Okay, let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell
me everything you feel.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Wires… metal, cold… something soft…</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Don’t touch that.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: More metal… sharp edge…</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Stay to your left.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Get outta here, Swan’s down, but they’re
chilling a device.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Something round, two wires …</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: That’s the blasting cap - good! Okay, now
grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait…</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Too easy. There’s gotta be something else in
there, another cap maybe.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Make up your mind, trigger.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Ease your thumb over to the right - feel
anything?</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Yeah, another round thing.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other
shuts it down.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Which one’s which?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: What… ?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: How the hell do you feel yellow?</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: No excuses, just do it!</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: All clear, but we need an ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Mayor loves a hero.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>bev</strong>: Hey, you look great.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>reilly</strong>: Nice to be here.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: That feeling won’t last long.</p>
