<h1 id="batman-2">batman-2</h1>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the hell – ?</p>
<p><strong>cop with mike</strong>: Yeah, you heard me. Snowmobiles! So
what do we do? Chase ’em on foot??</p>
<p><strong>cop i</strong>: …That was Batman.</p>
<p><strong>cop i</strong>: …Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>cop ii</strong>: Gift-wrapped and everything.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: After a high-speed chase – over $750,000 in
precious jewels were recovered intact by the police force – working in
concert with Batman.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I would like to stress – that while this
city enjoys a special relationship with Batman – – we do not condone
vigilantism –</p>
<p><strong>sekowsky</strong>: And hey! Where does this – – Gordon get
off calling us ? We’re not breakin’ any laws. We’re a group of concerned
citizens, that’s all – just like Batman.</p>
<p><strong>woman in crowd</strong>: You people are nothing but
hoodlums!</p>
<p><strong>sekowsky</strong>: Hey, lady – we’re out here on patrol
riskin’ our necks to protect old biddies like you. If this lame-o Gordon
could do his job –</p>
<p><strong>murdered</strong>: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed.” ALFRED digs around beneath
the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at the rear of the
drawer.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Sir? – MASTER BRUCE??</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m not deaf, Alfred. I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I took the liberty of preparing tea. I take
it you’ve been watching the news?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah…lot of crazy people in this world.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I should inform you…Christmas is
approaching, and we’ve received our annual solicitation from the
Fireman’s Toy Fund. If I may inquire…?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, yeah. Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Most ingenious, sir. What exactly it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What does it look like?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: To the untrained eye, sir, it looks
remarkably like…the skeleton of an umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good guess, Alfred. That’s exactly right.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I’m glad
you’re putting your time to such productive use. Now – the Toy Fund. Our
contribution last year was a half-million dollars…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We can do better than that.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Then there’s the foster-parents program… the
Gotham homeless crusade…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah…the holidays, I guess. Always gets me
thinking about… And to tell you the truth, I’m a little – concerned
about Vicki.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Miss Vale, sir…?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah. I’ve been thinking about it lately.
Thinking about it a lot… …and I still can’t figure out what to get her
for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Up and at ’em, Pengy. – Pengy?</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: You want to return the money you
stole.</p>
<p><strong>boniface</strong>: Intact. The map will show you where it’s
buried.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: All of it. Forty-two million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer ii</strong>: Why this sudden change of
heart?</p>
<p><strong>mr. boniface</strong>: Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid
in full. I want to be a part of civilized society! Prison life is not
for me. The guilt, the fear, the constant shame…one meets a disturbingly
low class of people.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer ii</strong>: Sure, but – forty-two million
dollars??</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: His record’s clean. Thirteen years without
an incident.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: I’d like to point out, my client’s put his
time to good use. A student of ornithology…articles published in several
respected journals…</p>
<p><strong>mr. boniface</strong>: Birds, yes. My only source of
solace.</p>
<p><strong>parole officer</strong>: In light of this rather
extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application
for parole.</p>
<p><strong>boniface</strong>: Thank you, sir. You won’t regret it.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Personally trained by my client.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boniface</strong>: – Where are my birds?!?</p>
<p><strong>t-bone</strong>: Shit, Pengy. I let ’em go.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boniface</strong>: Hermione. My canary. It’s the dead of
winter!</p>
<p><strong>t-bone</strong>: They were all cooped up. With you leaving
and all – seemed like the humane thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boniface</strong>: I see. – You might as well have this.
I won’t be needing it…</p>
<p><strong>t-bone</strong>: Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings.
Y’know, I’m gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boniface</strong>: You won’t miss it long.</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of planning
are about to pay off.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: I take it they found the money all
right?</p>
<p><strong>frack</strong>: We buried it exactly as you specified.
$42,271,009…</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: How much have we got left?</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: Let’s see – an initial capitalization of 42
million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return
of just under sixteen percent –</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Fine, fine. How much?</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: Seventy-nine million. – Excluding the sum we
buried.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Speaking of burials…</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a present
for Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: He won’t hear a word of it from me.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: He’s such a nightmare to shop for. – What do
you get him year after year, Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I find you can’t go wrong with surveillance
equipment. Let me put this under the tree…</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Not so fast.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Why, Miss Vale – !</p>
<p><strong>voice from behind</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Don’t look. It’s your present.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What’d you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m going to give you the happiest Christmas
you’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Homeless. I was just down here Tuesday. Seems
like there’s more every day.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: – Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: They’re already razing the tenements and
SRO’s downtown. These people don’t have anyplace else to go. If the city
starts selling off the park…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: – Yeah. I guess I’ll pass on dessert.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Bruce, you do a lot more than most people
even dream of.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes –</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: That’s not what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: – What I “do” doesn’t come close to the root
of the problem, Vicki. I’m just a Band-Aid.</p>
<p><strong>voice from behind</strong>: Bruce! It’s been ages!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Randall. You remember Vicki. – How’s the
construction business?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: The park tower? All systems go. If we can get
the junkies and winos cleared out… Not too late to get in on the
deal.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Say, Walter Barrett’s due back from Europe. We
should all get together at the club. Nice to see you again, Miss
Veal.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What a pig.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’ve known him since he was seven years old.
He was a pig then too.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Now he wants to gobble up the park… Bruce –
isn’t there something you can do about people like that?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What, tie him up with a bat-rope?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>red beret i</strong>: We were on patrol. Saw the whole
thing.</p>
<p><strong>jogger</strong>: I was attacked. Three men in ski masks –</p>
<p><strong>cop i</strong>: And these two broke it up?</p>
<p><strong>jogger</strong>: These two?? They ran like rabbits. I never
saw anybody take off so –</p>
<p><strong>red beret ii</strong>: Hey! Somebody had to go for the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>cop ii</strong>: You. SHUT UP, all right?? Lady, who was it
that bailed you out??</p>
<p><strong>jogger</strong>: A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He just
came out of nowhere and – tore into ’em. It was so quick I didn’t even
see his face.</p>
<p><strong>red beret i</strong>: Dumb shit. Shouldn’ta been jogging in
the park at night anyway. Look around you. It’s fulla bums.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Nice outfit.</p>
<p><strong>red beret i</strong>: Piss off, geek.</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: …and tomorrow, the city’s power elite
will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter
Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yo. Ricky here. What’s the haps?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Well. “Ricky,” is it?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: How’d you know that?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I heard you on the phone. Talking to your
girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Girlfriend? No, no. That was business.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: If you’ve got time for a little pleasure
…maybe you’d like to buy me a drink.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Jeez – they look almost real.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Why wouldn’t they be?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You’d have to be crazy. Nobody’d wear the
real thing to a dive like this.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Oh, they’re real, all right. So are
these.</p>
<p><strong>dock goon i</strong>: Where’s that goddam Ricky?</p>
<p><strong>dock goon ii</strong>: Probably out gettin’ laid. And here we
are freezin’ our balls off…</p>
<p><strong>boat thug i</strong>: You pick.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: It’s pure.</p>
<p><strong>chief goon</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>boat thug i</strong>: Hold it. Let’s see the money.</p>
<p><strong>you son of a bitch!</strong>: Go after it. Get the money.
GO!!</p>
<p><strong>boat thug i</strong>: Soltar las amarras! – CAST OFF!!</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!!</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: Mr. Boniface? Your…visitor has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: At last we meet. – Pigeons?</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Yes, they’re common birds – dirty, stupid,
unattractive – but they’re very obedient, and they do crap on people’s
heads. May I?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I’ve located the others. All but one. I’m
surprised you don’t catch pneumonia – !</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: My normal body temperature is ninety-two
degrees. Germs find me inhospitable.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I see why they call you the Penguin.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: They may call me that…but rarely more than
once. Champagne?</p>
<p><strong>bullock</strong>: It wasn’t about the drugs. Whoever it was
left thirty kilos sitting on the docks.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What’s that he keeps saying?</p>
<p><strong>bullock</strong>: “Murcielago.” – Bat.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Nonsense. That dock looked like a
slaughter-house. Batman’s never committed murder.</p>
<p><strong>bullock</strong>: We did find this in his back pocket.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Commissioner? We’ve got Barrett.</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: Fine welcome. These storm troopers of yours
dragged me away from my coming-home party! I’d like to know the meaning
of this –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’d like to know how thirty kilos of pure
cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects.</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: Gordon – I come from one of the oldest and
most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of
smuggling drugs, be my guest. I’ll have your badge before you leave this
room.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Book the son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: I believe I’m still entitled to a phone
call.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Come on! Let’s move it! We’re an hour behind
as it is!!</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Jesus Christ, that’s Bruce Wayne’s bimbo!</p>
<p><strong>hardhat</strong>: Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it’s
urgent.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash.</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: It’s me, Randall – Walter Barrett. I want
you to call my attorney. That was my shipment they busted up last
night.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Jesus, Walter, I – Why are you calling
me??</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: It’s worse than that. Somebody took my
raven.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Great stuff, but we’re looking at a
shitfight with our beloved publisher. He and Shaw… Old money sticks
together.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’d sure like to know what shook him up so.
He was out of there like a scared rabbit…</p>
<p><strong>wilk</strong>: Got a blind tip from downtown. You know that
massacre on the docks? Batman.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Whoa! Is this on the level?</p>
<p><strong>wilk</strong>: Cops even got a note. “Those who feed on the
soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!” Sounds like your pal’s cranked it
up a notch.</p>
<p><strong>batman implicated in dock massacre</strong>: Industrialist
Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Seen the late edition?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I’m afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is
sequestered in the cave.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle.</p>
<p><strong>city official i</strong>: And I suppose anyone could’ve taken
out a boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim – murdered in cold blood
–</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Before we forget, Batman’s saved hundreds of
lives!</p>
<p><strong>city official ii</strong>: He’s still a vigilante. We don’t
know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it…</p>
<p><strong>city official i</strong>: Street punks are one thing, Jim.
This is Walter Barrett – a personal friend of mine!</p>
<p><strong>city offcial ii</strong>: You’ve gotta bring him in, Jim – at
least for questioning. It would sure help if we could get that mask
off…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen…I’ve been framed.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: One-delta-niner – 10-80 on Riverview
north-bound at 33rd – 10-78, repeat 10-78.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Evasive.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s a fake.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars.
You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Absolutely. You see, I…happen to know where
the real one is stashed.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: I guess you’d know. I have some “friends” in
the art world. They say that – for certain hard-to-get items – you’re
the one to call.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: How flattering.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: They say for the right price…you could steal
Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you
hear?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Oh, I’m not one to judge. I admire people who
take what they want. I’m just curious how you do it.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I find that the old methods work best.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Hey, what are you doing – ?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: You’re very inquisitive. You’ll just have to
be disciplined.</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: You know, I’ve…I’ve never really done this
kind of thing before.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I think people should indulge their
fantasies. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shaw</strong>: Hey, what are those – what are you –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey. You see what I saw…?</p>
<p><strong>bullock</strong>: It’s Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. – We
just made Batman up on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Please, just one. It’s important for people
to see what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: They don’t want to see us, lady. They
just want us gone – out of sight, and out of mind. Get worse before it
gets better. It always does.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: WAIT! Don’t be afraid. I wanted to thank you.
I –</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Twenty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: …Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Dick.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Now Hecate. You don’t want that
scrawny little bird –</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Do you want me to wring that creature’s
neck?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: You try it, I’ll do the same to you. I saw
him, you know.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Saw who?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Batman. He was dreamy.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God – Are you
sure it was him? What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: He stood on a roof and watched me. He didn’t
realize I’d seen him. I don’t think he knew quite what to make of me.
But he was definitely interested.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: This scheme of yours is backfiring. We
don’t need him on our tails. Do you know how much money is at stake
here?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Money isn’t everything. What’s the point if
we can’t enjoy ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Six-on-one, and he took ’em all out…then
vanished into a drainage pipe – right next to the statue of General
Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: My illustrious great-grandfather. Think it’s
the same kid we heard about?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Must be. He reminded me of you.</p>
<p><strong>new bat-murder?</strong>: Batman Suspect in Slaying of
Millionaire Developer</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: – You work for this rag? Your boss is calling
for Gordon’s resignation – unless he brings Batman in for
questioning…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I need a good PR man.</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: Hey, pal – you buyin’ or borrowin’?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: That’s what happens when you go after the
rich and powerful.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey, it wasn’t me, remember? I am rich and
powerful –</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Maybe it’s almost…good. In a weird way. I
mean, Shaw, and Barrett – if people like that were really scared, maybe
they’d –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Quiet. I’m looking for a personal ad.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Is this some kind of bad joke?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s her. That cat woman, or whatever she is.
“I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you’d follow, but you were too
shy…”</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What does she want – a date?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She’s trying to contact me. Says she’s gonna
leave me another ad…</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Close the door. Your story isn’t news. With
Shaw dead –</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: But the project’s still going ahead! If
attacking homeless people in the park isn’t news, I’d like to know what
is –</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: There’s a psycho out there in a mask and
cape – killing off Gotham’s most prominent citizens! That’s news. I’ve
known Randall Shaw all my life. His family is in mourning. And it just
so happens I don’t believe in slandering the dead.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Mr. Provost – how much money do you have tied
up in the Park Tower project?</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Vicki…I’m going to forget you made that
remark. For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same.</p>
<p><strong>reporter i</strong>: Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the
arraignment?</p>
<p><strong>reporter ii</strong>: Is it true bail was set at two million
dollars?</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Stand back! My client has nothing to say
at this time!</p>
<p><strong>barrett</strong>: It’s time we called an emergency meeting of
the Raven Society. Get back to me…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Just washed it, too.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They want
to know if you’ll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian
exhibit.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Cancel.</p>
<p><strong>sekowsky</strong>: Jeez! Talk about gratitude – !!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, Alfred, it’s official. I’m a wanted
man. “New evidence”…I’ve gotta find that woman. Did you check the
personals?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Jim Gordon, Alfred. I’ve got to see
Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Sorry to bother you. Bruce – I’ll get right
down to it. You knew Shaw and Barrett –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I saw them occasionally. We all sat on the
board of the Fluegelheim…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Did you have any…dealings with them, or
–</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No. I never liked the way they did
business.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: The thing is, Bruce, you’re all lumped
together in the public mind – the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of
thing – and, uh… Harrison Provost got this in the mail.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Then Batman is behind all this.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Batman or a damned good imitation.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well. He’s changed tactics, hasn’t he.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Shaw, with his high-rises – Barrett, a
druglord, major polluter – they weren’t exactly model citizens. Who
knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You mean he’s going after…the root of the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Let me know if you get one of these. We’ll
put all our resources at your disposal.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Changed my mind, Alfred. I’ll be dropping in
on the Fluegelheim after all.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I just had a weird sense of deja vu.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Harrison – we really ought to warn Bruce.
We owe him that much.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good to see you two. Looks like the Five
Families are suddenly down to three. In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb
on this room right now –</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to
think we should all be hiring bodyguards.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree provost</strong>: Oh, that’s absurd. I already
have.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Thing is, I can’t imagine why Batman would be
after us. Can you?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: You two look like you need a drink. – And is
this who I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Selina Kyle – Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Our absentee board member! I’ve been wanting
to meet you forever.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Selina’s the new Curator of Antiquities.
She brought the Temple over block by block –</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: You two won’t be terribly upset if I borrow
Bruce for a moment, will you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can’t imagine why.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Tax year’s almost over, you know. I hope we
can count on your usual generous donation. Someone’s got to set an
example for those two tightwads.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: They’re proccupied. This string of murders
–</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I asked them if they’d consider including us
in their wills. They didn’t seem a bit amused…</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: – and this is my good friend Bastet, the
Egyptian Cat Goddess.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I think we’ve already met. – This is quite an
expedition you’ve put together.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I’m glad you think so. I have to say, Bruce
– you’re not at all what I expected.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Oh, it’s not that. Not at all. It’s just
that I’d always heard you were…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Oh…sort of a…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No. Come on. What?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh. Selina Kyle – my friend Vicki Vale.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: The photographer. I’ve seen your pictures in
the Gazette.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: The Globe.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Oh, that’s right. The tabloid one. – What an
original dress!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Selina supervised the reconstruction of the
temple. Brought it back from Egypt… stone by stone.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Really. She must be awfully tired. How’d you
get to be in charge of a huge project like this?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Pull in the claws, okay? She’s really
terrific.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I’m sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a
little…aggressive, you know? Look, I need to talk to you. Come by
sometime. I’ll give you the private tour.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Wait. Let me explain about Vicki –</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I understand. Anyone who’s that protective
must have a pretty good reason for it.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: How’s “business”?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Relax, okay? I like you better.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: If you’re looking for your fellow
millionaires, they left some time back.</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Don’t worry about that. I’ve had the office
swept for bugs. No one’s listening…</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: It’s just so – unfair. I mean…it was over a
century ago. It’s not like we’re responsible. How could he know? How
could Batman know about the Raven Society??</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Who knows and who cares. The point is, it’s
happened…</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: I’ll tell you how to reach me. And don’t
repeat this to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: He’s just another rich idiot. The odd thing
is, he didn’t seem a bit concerned.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Then he is an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: He lives in some big sprawling manor. I’ll
have to get inside, scope it out… see where he’s got the raven
stashed.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: How do you plan to do that?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: How do you think!</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: It’s Mr. Provost, sir. He’s planning to
embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Good! That should save us a trip to the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What have we got here?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Mummified cats. Bastet’s sacred animal. They
were buried by the thousands at Bubastis. – Oh, careful!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You’re in a gruesome line of work.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Keeps me interested. And that’s not easy to
do…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This one I know. It’s a gryphon, right?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird,
half-lion…sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and
justice.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Poor guy. Birds and cats – you wouldn’t think
the two halves would cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Only under certain circumstances. I’m really
glad you came, Bruce. I was afraid I’d given you the wrong impression.
Or maybe it was the right impression.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What was it you wanted to talk to me
about?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Your collection. I’d love to see it. I mean,
everyone says you’ve got a fabulous –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: It must be strange. Having all that power,
and money – never really knowing if that’s what people are attracted
to.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What are you attracted to?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I think you’re a little bit nuts. I think
you’re a little – bored with your life. Having everything you want. No
variety, no…danger. And every once in a while you need to take a risk.
Shake it all up.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Maybe by…coming here today.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Is there a cat in here?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Poor thing. You’re allergic!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, cats…ever since I was a kid… Look, I’d
better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay…</p>
<p><strong>batman: hero or menace?</strong>: Read All About It in the
GOTHAM GLOBE!</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and
tell her where to meet me. No trouble on the way, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>lead guard</strong>: No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight
from the bank vault.</p>
<p><strong>guard ii</strong>: ’Copter should be just touching down.
We’ll have you safely out of here in no time.</p>
<p><strong>guard ii</strong>: We’ll check the stairs. See you on the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: No – my private elevator. It’s safer.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No way. They don’t pay us enough to tangle
with Batm–</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: What is it?? What’s happening??</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: There. Mr. Provost. See? The generator’s
kicked in. It’s just an electrical problem.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: There. See? It’s moving. We’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: It’s going down. We’re going DOWN!!!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Okay, Mr. Provost – I’m gonna have a look
through the trap door. But I need you to help me. Okay? You have to
help.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Probably just some bird that’s gotten in the
shaft. Now calm down. You’ll have to give me a boost.</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: W-who is this??</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of that
car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter.</p>
<p><strong>shut up in there.</strong>: You should see a cord hanging
just behind you.</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Yes – yes, I see it –</p>
<p><strong>provost</strong>: Who are you?? Why are you doing this??</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call
me an irate reader. And to be perfectly frank – I’m doing this because I
hate Garfield.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Going down!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Ten! Nine!…</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: …Three! Two! One!</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: Hey! No! I aleady got a –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Some people just can’t take discipline. Go
ahead. Finish ’em off…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You might as well. You’re going to get
blamed for it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to.
Besides – I want to see how you do it!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: My, aren’t we frisky tonight.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I should tell you – I’ve got nine lives to
play with – and you’ve only got one…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Did I tell you I invited company? – Keep
’em busy, angel, I’ve gotta scat.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Look at that, boys – they do flock
together!!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Ooh. Where have you been all my life?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Nevermore. Nevermore!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Cute, huh! I think it’ll look nice over
the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. I hope you
won’t think I’m too… aggressive or anything, but I find you very
attractive.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Mice, really. It’s disgusting – they beg
you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. Once
you’ve had your fun there’s not much you can do but kill them. But you
seem different. I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up… that
saves a lot of explaining. I think people should indulge their
fantasies, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: So I think I’ll let you live. Cute boys
like you are hard to find… ’Bye, angel. I’ll be thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Gee…I’m so fickle.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Awright, what’s the problem here?
Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Good God. Cowan – get to the car – radio
the commissioner!!</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Is he dead? What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: The mask. Get the mask off.</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Some kinda seam here on the neck…</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: DON’T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd –</p>
<p><strong>bullock</strong>: Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We’ll
have to go in on foot…</p>
<p><strong>red beret i</strong>: This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens
around here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: It’s MINE!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Dumb son of a bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to
install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor – in
round-the-clock shifts – to protect you from Batman.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Great. What’d you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I told him that since you were Batman, you’d
require no protection from Batman.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Jesus, Alfred – !!</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: In future, sir…I strongly advise against
trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s just a few bruises.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire
body.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m getting too old for this line of work.
Cops placed me at the scene of the crime – that weird kid of Vicki’s saw
my face –</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I shouldn’t worry overmuch. I doubt the two
of you move in the same circles.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: – and I got the living shit knocked out of me
by a woman.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Sir – such outmoded sexist attitudes are
quite unbecoming.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothesman</strong>: Mailman’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Anything suspicious!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills.</p>
<p><strong>bomb-disposal expert</strong>: Commissioner – ?</p>
<p><strong>bomb-disposal expert</strong>: It’s a fruitcake.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: …Have it analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Mrs. Tiptree? The car’s here.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: I don’t wanna go to Grandma’s. I wanna
stay here with Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. tiptree</strong>: She’s got a nice tree just like ours,
honey. Daddy’ll be up as soon as he can.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: She’s old. She doesn’t even have
cable.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: What about our presents?</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll bring ’em up with me.
We’ll open ’em when I get there.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Sorry, folks, but we’d better move
along.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. tiptree</strong>: Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: They’ll be safe, won’t they?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: As safe as we can make ’em. It would help if
you could give us some small hint what this is all about.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: I told you. I…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You have no idea what was in that box that
Provost had delivered from the bank.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>voice on loudspeaker</strong>: Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen
– we’ve got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at
twenty-six and an eighth –</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Not today, Andy. Let’s talk after New
Year’s.</p>
<p><strong>batman sought in publisher’s murder</strong>: Bat Attack
Panics Gotham Square</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: English accents are so stimulating. You have
the most beautiful silver hair!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Selina. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I wanted to see your things, remember? And I
got tired of waiting for you to call me back. He’s adorable. How long
have you had him?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You heard about Harry Provost.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: It’s incredibly awful. It got me a little
worried. I hate to think of something happening to you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: It’s odd, though. Danger, the thought of
suddenly dying – in a weird way it gets you sort of…aroused. Don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Bruce, this is incredible. Malaysian – ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: It’s like – everything in here is another
little piece of your mind. I was right about you. Promise, okay? Promise
you’ll show me every inch of this place.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: The police have no files whatsoever on
Selina Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: London…Cairo…Belgium…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What exactly are you –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Her credit card records. Every major art
theft in the last five years – she’s been on the scene or close to
it.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: You mean she’s some sort of – collector?
A…cat burglar, or –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Could be. Museum curator, authenticator –
she’s got the perfect cover for it. What would she want with that stupid
raven?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Raven, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s what the Catwoman took from Provost. A
little raven statuette, about so big… But it couldn’t have been that
valuable.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: How very odd. I’m sure it’s nothing, but
–</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What, Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Your father had a raven, sir. A small statue
of the very sort you describe. It used to sit on his desk.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: After your father’s…demise, Mr. Tiptree came
to the house and asked if he could have it. As a keepsake. I saw no
harm… That was thirty years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott’s
father.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What are you looking for – Batarangs?</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Bruce! Come on up. I want to talk to
Mr. Wayne alone.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry
about the wrapping – the police made me open it.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: …I’m afraid I don’t have anything for
you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I think you may have something that belonged
to my father.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: – You know?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What are you talking about? Who?</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Batman. I don’t know how he found out, but
–</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s time you told me what’s going on
here.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Didn’t you ever wonder where it came from,
Bruce? All the privilege, all the power …all the money? The ravens are
a…a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Whose fortune?</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Gotham City’s.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was
looted. It was a fantastic operation – perfect military precision. The
robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion…</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: The city was going under. Bankrupt… until
five rich men stepped in to bail it out. In exchange they took the land
rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The Five Families.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City –
carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich
beyond imagining. We’ve just been following in their footsteps. And in
all this time no one’s ever suspected –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: – that they were the ones behind the
robbery?</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: They had five ravens made. Five ravens
which – combined – would reveal the location of the treasure they’d
stolen. But they never touched it. They never needed to. It’s still
there to this day.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: The ravens, and the secret – have been
passed down through generations. Father to son… Your father – died
before he could tell you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So they stole his piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Yeah. I’ve got it, Bruce, and I’m going to
hand it over. He’s right, you know. We’ve all been feeding – feeding on
the soul of Gotham…</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: It wasn’t his doing, Bruce. It was –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That doesn’t matter. If he knew that his
fortune was based on a crime – a crime against the city… Reputation or
not, he would’ve tried to –</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it
out for you?!?</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: They killed him…to protect their secret
…and now the bill’s come due. Now the bill’s come due.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Thank you, yes, everything’s fine. I’ll
expect your next call in an hour. The police are becoming an awful
nuisance.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There must
be something we can do.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I realized long ago – that there are places
in Mr. Wayne’s heart which no one will ever penetrate – or share. He
loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain ways he will always be alone.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …Thanks for the testimonial.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Tiptree’s planning some kind of rendezvous
with ‘Batman.’ I think Batman ought to be there when it happens.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I see, sir. When shall we expect you
back?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Get your cap. You’re driving.</p>
<p><strong>stakeout cop i</strong>: Shit – that’s Tiptree!!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: We’ve gotta get back to the radio.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: According to this, he’s directly below
us.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: The subway, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah. Take a right.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He’s slowed down. Looks like he’s under the
park.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: How do you propose to get down there, sir?
We can’t have Batman strolling up to buy a token.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I know another way in. Step on it. They’re
down there waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: I’ve cooperated. I’ve done everything you
said.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Open the case.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: The other one is Bruce Wayne’s. He doesn’t
know anything about this. You’ve got what you want. There’s no need to
–</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: My family. You won’t –</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: We’ll certainly take your unexpected
generosity into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>tiptree</strong>: We – ?!? You’re not Batman.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: No. I’m his brother-in-law – Birdman. Now
move out.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: That idiot. Another six feet –</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: So sorry to spoil your fun. – He brought
two ravens. We’ve got a complete set!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Yeah! They’re in the suitcase –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: God. Did you see him? Isn’t he hot?</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Haven’t you got anything else to think
about? I’m hot. That was exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: No pain, no gain! – Suck it up. We’re not
out of here yet.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: What happens now?</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: I don’t know. That’s all…!</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: That’s the treasure?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: No. It’s a map…</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Bruce Wayne. So he doesn’t know a thing
about the treasure, eh…? Look at this. It’s right under Wayne Manor.
It’s been there all along!</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: No, no – don’t try to get up – you’re
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I don’t belong here. You can’t keep me
here.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: It’s “Dick”, isn’t it? Or do you prefer
“Richard”?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: “R” – for Richard, right? See, all your
things are here… What is it, some kind of gymnast’s outfit?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: It’s none of your business. What is this, some
kind of home?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: No, not that kind. There’s a swimming pool –
tennis court – you can have anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Tennis court?! – Lady, you’re rich. How the
hell would you know what I want?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I’m not staying. You can’t make me –</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can make you.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What do you propose to do with him, sir?
Keep him in the room for the rest of his life?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t know, Alfred. I’ve got other stuff to
worry about.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: The child is hurt, sir. At the very least we
should attempt to locate his parents.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He hasn’t got any parents.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: How do you know that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …I know.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Sir – it’s Miss Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we still
on for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Is this necessary, sir? After all…it is
Christmas eve.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Stuff’ll knock out a moose, much less a
cat.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I don’t like to see you going out on a
date…unprotected, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She’ll be ready for Batman – but not for me.
It’s the only way, Alfred. I’ve got to take her out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: You’re early. I’m afraid I’m not quite
dressed.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Christmas eve. No tree?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: No presents. I’ve been a bad girl this
year.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m surprised you kept this date. I thought
you would’ve lost interest by now.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You’ve got what you want, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I do now. We’ve had this date for a long,
long time.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How much is it going to cost me?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …To get the ravens back.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: You’re the oddest man I’ve ever met. Let’s
talk later, Bruce. I’ve got kind of a short fuse…</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Did I hurt you? Just relax – you’ll start to
enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What di– what did you d–</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I guess I’ve…gotten under your skin.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Everything’s fine, thank you. We’ll talk in
an hour.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Try his mag card.</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: Look at this. He’s a pillhead.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Ohh. Am I glad to –</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What did you do to him??</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: First-time jitters, I guess. Everything was
going great, and then…he just went limp as a noodle.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: You’d be the butler. Why don’t you come on
down and attend to your guests?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Mr. Wayne. Is he – ?</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: You know how it is. Some guys just can’t
hold their egg nog.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: I should explain the occasion of our visit.
There’s a treasure underneath this house – and I don’t plan to leave
until you tell me how to find it. Now who’s going to talk – Miss
Vale?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: The cave. Under the house. How do I get
there?</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Then maybe you’d like to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: You’re no more than a common thief.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a very
uncommon thief. Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early
present this year?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I…don’t…know…</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Then go ahead, Mr. Frick…decorate the
tree.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Wait! We don’t know how to get down there
yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Why don’t you two tie up our host?</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: It’s all so plush and tasteful, isn’t it?
Just the sort of setting in which I’ve always imagined myself.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I think you’re a dirty little man with a
–</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: See, boys, that’s old money talking. After
a while, they actually start to believe they’ve earned all this. I don’t
mind. Someday I’ll be old money too – when the statute of limitations
runs out.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Hey! – Guess what I just found.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Let’s spread out and see what we can find.
You two – keep an eye on our friends here. Give me a yell the minute
Wayne comes to.</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: Better check it out.</p>
<p><strong>frack</strong>: Some kind of security system –</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Can you move, man?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Library – got to get me to the library –</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: What is that ungodly racket?</p>
<p><strong>frack</strong>: A security alarm. It went off in the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: My God! Is someone in here?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I’ll go back.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can’t…get down there…without you.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: What an extraordinarily stupid thing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: SHUT UP. Help me with him.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: You and I had better check the ground floor
and see what’s going on. Mr. Frick – do you think you’ll be able to
manage this pair?</p>
<p><strong>frick</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Oh, good. That does relieve my mind –</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Check the grounds! The shape he’s in, he
can’t have gotten far.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: – as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait
for my signal. You know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Here. You might need it.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Thank you, Master Dick. And…bravo.</p>
<p><strong>voice from behind</strong>: Do you really think we’re that
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: You know, I’ve got a great recipe for Sliced
Bitch –</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: I love a good old-fashioned catfight – but
this is pissing me off.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: HERE, kitty kitty kitty…HERE, kitty
kitty…</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: So this is where you earn your keep.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Mmm! Frederick’s of Gotham?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Not so loud, honey! The neighbors’ll get the
wrong idea. Santa’s coming. Time for all good girls to go to sleep…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Miss me, “Angel”?</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Okay – let’s do it, huh? You and me… all the
way this time.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Come on. We’ll be safe in the cave.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Come on. Come with us.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: No. I can still help…</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Such primitive entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: The Gotham City Treasury. It’s about to be
stolen twice.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Don’t be absurd. You’ll never be able to get
it out of here.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Oh, I’ll manage somehow. You two are my
guarantee of that. Let’s have a look, shall we? You go first.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: It could’ve been so nice – you and me – if
only you weren’t so screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: It’s over. I don’t want to hurt you any
more.</p>
<p><strong>selina</strong>: Tell me something – one thing. If you don’t
enjoy all this…why do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Nine lives.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I can’t move. I can’t move.</p>
<p><strong>don’t look at me!!</strong>: Do me, baby…do me now…that’s
what I want. Please?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: COME ON. Don’t stop now. FINISH ME OFF.
Son of a bitch. You’re all alike…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You should’ve done it, man. You should’ve
killed her.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: There’s a radio in the cave. We’ll send for
help.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at you
now. Whatever would your friends say? You’ve been an exceptionally
congenial host – but I must ask you to back off.</p>
<p><strong>penguin</strong>: No sudden moves. It’s a long way down.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: …and then Batman showed up?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He saved all our lives, Jim. I can’t say for
sure, but I’d bet she’s the one behind the murders.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: God – I pray you’re right. One thing before
we go, Bruce. Who’s the kid?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oh, that’s Vicki’s little cousin. He’s in
town for the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit.
Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck cleaning this place up.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: What are you going to do with all that
gold?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I dunno. Might be a good start on a place to
live – for some people who don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: It’s Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah. Maybe you should – open your
present.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Oh, Bruce, presents doesn’t matter. None of
it matters. We’re all safe. We’re together.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …You might as well.</p>
