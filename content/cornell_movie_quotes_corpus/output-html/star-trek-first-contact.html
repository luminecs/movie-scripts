<p><strong>borg</strong>: Restrict search parameters to 1-9- 9-8 through
2-0-8-4.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Stop search. Calculate temporal
coordinates. J-Fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We’ll
cover them.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Dispersive armor is holding.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four,
port side battery.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Port battery, ready sir!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Starboard battery – fire.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: The Borg ship has modified its shields,
Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Ready quantum torpedo.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Aye, sir. Only three left.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s com voice</strong>: La Forge to bridge.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Captain, I’m starting to worry about the
hull integrity. We’ve been running the support field at full power for
three hours straight. I don’t know how much longer it’s going to hold
up.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Understood. Keep me informed.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Incoming transmission from the Borg.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>borg</strong>: Your defense perimeter is useless. You will be
assimilated.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Break off your attack. By now, you must
realize you can’t win…</p>
<p><strong>borg</strong>: Your opinion is irrelevant. We are the Borg.
Resistance is futile.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’ll see about that… Fire.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Main power still on-line, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling
on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid.
Admiral Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>admiral hayes</strong>: The new quantum torpedoes are doing
the trick, Jean-Luc. We’ve destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far… and
only lost fifteen of our own. But one of the Borg ships has broken
through our defenses, and it’s heading directly for Earth. Can you
handle it?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>admiral hayes</strong>: Good hunting. Hayes out.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum
warp.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: We are approaching the Terran System,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Go to impulse. Where’s the Borg ship?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It has entered Earth orbit. Correction – it is
not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Some sort of suicide tactic?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Unknown, sir. Suicide tactics are not normally
associated with the Borg.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Sensors show a temporal signature emanating
from the Sphere. High concentrations of tachyons…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: And chronometric particles… it’s as though
they’re trying to create a temporal vortex…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Time travel… they’re attempting time travel…
Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Range – fifty kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: A temporal vortex is forming directly ahead of
the Sphere.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Main power off-line!</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Switching to emergency back-ups.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We’re caught in some kind of energy wake from
the vortex…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Worf… torpedo… now!</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I have helm control.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Where’s the Sphere?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: They have traveled into the vortex… through
time.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: The vortex is collapsing, sir.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Contact Starfleet Command.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: No response. I’m not reading any Starfleet com
traffic in this entire sector.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Captain, I’ve scanned the planet. The
atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and
fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Life signs?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Population… thirty-five billion… All Borg.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: The planet’s surface is covered with Borg
technology. So is the moon… and three other planets in this solar
system.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: But how?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: They must’ve done it in the past… they went
back and changed history…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: They did it… they assimilated Earth.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: But if they changed history… then why are we
still here?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: We were caught in the temporal wake from the
vortex. It must have protected us from any changes in the time-line.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in
on our position.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Data, set a course for that vortex.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Captain…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We have to follow them back… repair whatever
damage they’ve done to that time-line.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Course laid in. Engaging impulse engines.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Hull integrity down to thirty percent…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Steady as she goes.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Borg vessels are closing to two thousand
meters.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Take us in!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Report.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We’re still in Earth orbit.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What year is it?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: According to our astrometric readings… the
year is 2063.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Captain, I’ve found the Borg Sphere. It’s on
the far side of the planet…firing at the surface.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Intercept course, full impulse. Weapons
status?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Phasers are off-line… we have two quantum
torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Go to manual.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Track their weapons fire.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Western hemisphere… North American
continent…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: We are within torpedo range.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: They’ve seen us. They’re taking evasive
action.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Mister Worf?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Target…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Captain, they’re firing at a nuclear missile
silo… in central Montana.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Target…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Montana…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Target locked!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Mister Data, I want to know the exact date
and time. Give me a damage report on that missile silo.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Today is March second, 2063. The time in
Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Looks like they damaged the silo…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Life signs?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Can’t tell. Long-range bio- sensors are
off-line.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge
and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is
supposed to conduct the very first warp test… from a missile silo in
Montana. If I’m right, the Borg were trying to change the course of
human history by killing him or destroying his ship.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: And if they succeed, humans won’t make First
Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow. As First Officer I should be the one
beaming down…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Normally, I would agree. But in this case,
the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You’re
many things, Number One, but you’re not much of an historian.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Good luck, sir.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’ll keep in contact. You have the
Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Will somebody please tell me where we’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Montana. Energize.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why
the hell are we –</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: – going to Montana?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one
zero… distance, three hundred meters.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me
what we’re doing here?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’re here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may
be injured or dead.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Cochrane… the inventor of warp drive?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: But he’s been dead for three hundred… Oh
God… we’ve gone back in time again, haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m afraid so. If the Borg succeed in
preventing First Contact with the Vulcans… Earth will remain in the
Second Dark Age… an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th
century.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Well, why didn’t you just say so in the
first place?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Lieutenant Sandra Farrel.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: It appears death was caused by a plasma
discharge. I’ll note in her record that she never left her post.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Did you know her?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Not very well. We met shortly after the
Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most… promising
officer.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Data… are you sure you’re all right?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I am still having difficulty integrating
certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: We still have to make reports on ten more
crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip
until we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and
neither should I.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: I will admit… there are times when I wish I
had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Riker to Data.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Go ahead, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We’re reading some kind of gas leak in the
Environmental Control Room. Take a repair team down and check it
out.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: On my way, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: One of the diathermic oxygen tanks has been
damaged.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Diathermic oxygen?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It is a new subsystem of Nova Class ships. It
regulates hydropressure and temperature variance. Remain here. The gas
is highly corrosive to organic material. It would liquefy your flesh on
contact.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Be my guest, sir.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Begin a diagnostic on the safety interlocks.
There appears to have been some damage during the attack.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Ensign Porter?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Ensign… are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Data to Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Data to Security. This is Lieutenant Data to
anyone who can hear my signal. I need assistance in the Environmental
Control Room.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: This must be it.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How serious is the damage?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: I’m having trouble scanning underground.
There’s a lot of radiation leaking from something.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane
was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: This will protect us from the
radiation.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: I’m picking up faint life signs twenty
meters below.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There should be an access hatch nearby…</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get
in…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I have the password right here.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: See if any of these men are Cochrane.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Mitchell… DePaul…</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: This one’s a woman… named Kirby.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: There’s a life sign behind this door… about
ten meters below.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Blast door. It’s designed to protect the
control room when the missile is launched.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There should be some kind of manual
release…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Get those fires out and then try to restore
main power to the control room.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Got it, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Severe radiation exposure…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It’s Cochrane.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I’ve stabilized him for now… but he’s in a
coma and he’s going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to
the ship.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Picard to Enterprise. Enterprise, please
respond.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from
the surface.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Mister La Forge, listen very carefully. If
you remember your history… in less than twenty- four hours, a Vulcan
ship will be passing through this system. When it does, this ship needs
to be in space, flying at warp speed.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: I’d better get started.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It’s not the radiation… and there’s nothing
wrong with the combadges… the Enterprise just isn’t responding.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention,
now.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: As I recall, the town of Resurrection is
about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital…</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: What are we waiting for? Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It may not be that simple. This is an
extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Are you saying they won’t help us?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m saying they might shoot us on sight. You
have to remember… these people have watched their entire way of life
collapse around them.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: There must be some good people… even in
this time.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Let’s hope so. Because if Cochrane dies… the
future may die with him.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: I have assigned two damage control teams to
locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they’ve had no
success.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Assign another team if you need to. I want to
re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Are we in any danger of being detected by
Earth defense systems?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: There were no planetary defense systems in
this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other… not
extraterrestrials.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We have to start thinking about a way to get
home. Analyze our readings from the temporal vortex. We’re going to have
to recreate whatever the Borg did to –</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Report.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: We just lost main power… and we’ve got
Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I’m not sure what’s –</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: A ship-wide decompression has been
initiated!</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: We’re venting our internal atmosphere directly
into space!</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: What the hell is happening, Worf?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: It appears that someone has taken over the
Environmental Control Room.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Someone…?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: The Borg. Some of them must’ve beamed over
before we destroyed their ship. Seal off that entire deck with emergency
force fields.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Wil… Data was down there.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Mister Worf… find Data if you can, but your
top priority is isolating the Borg.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Understood.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Your efforts to assimilate me will be
unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It would appear that resistance is not always
futile.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Brave words. I’ve heard them before
from thousands of species across thousands of worlds… since long before
you were created.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: But now… they are all one with the
Borg.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered
before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The
information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You are an imperfect being… created
by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of
time.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How long has he been unconscious?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: At least four hours.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It looks like he has a cranial fracture, but
I’ll need X-rays to be sure. Get Ruby in here.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: He has a severe fracture of the left
occipital plate. He’s not hemorrhaging… but the radiation has damaged
his KNA and his APR cell count…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: “APR cell count?” What the hell are you
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Doctor Crusher has been… studying some
advanced medical theories.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: It’s a… new medical scanner. It’s a little
more precise than an X-ray machine.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Is it Japanese?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Um… yeah. Now he’s going to need a
respirator. Do you have one?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We have two… but we don’t have the juice to
run them.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Juice?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Power. There hasn’t been a lot of wind
through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are
depleted.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Don’t you have any generators, or other
fuel sources?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Maybe you’d like to take your patient to the
hospital in Bozemen… it’s only two hundred miles away.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: His automatic reflexes are fluctuating.
We’ve got to get him on a respirator.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Bag him.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Beverly – your tricorder.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Where’s the battery room for the
hospital?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I told you, there’s no –</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Outside, around back. Next to the water
tank.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: His heartbeat’s irregular…</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Adrenaline – ten CC’s!</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: One… two… three… compress!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What did you do to the batteries?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Oh… just a little tinkering. How is he?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: He’s stable… for now. But it would be
better if we could contact… our friends.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes. But until then, you’ll have to make do
with what you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: That’ll be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ruby’s voice</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There was some kind of explosion out at the
missile silo…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Ruby, we’re going to need a series of
cranial X-rays tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I have a fresh set of plates at home. I’ll
have them here by eight.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Take care of him. He’s a very special man.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s com voice</strong>: La Forge to Picard.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I think there’s someone in your pants.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Excuse me. I have a… telephone call.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Picard here.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s com voice</strong>: Captain, we have a problem. I
think you’d better get back here.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m on my way. Picard out.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I have to go back to the silo. Will you be
all right?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I’ll be fine. He’s a different story.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Catch.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Think you’ll need that.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: It’s no zone solution. You know. “No
ozone.”</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Oh… yes… ultraviolet protection. Thank you.
Mister…?</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan
Scrimm. I’m the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. And you
are?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Great name. French?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: You don’t sound French.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I was raised in England and here in the
States. Thank you for the… no zone.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Where in the States?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Oh… here and there. You know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Not really. I was born and raised right
here. Never had much use for travel.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Where are you from most recently?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: California. San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn’t
think anyone still lived there.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There’s a few of us left.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: That was a pretty clever trick you did with
the hospital’s batteries. How’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It wasn’t a trick. I used to be an
electrical engineer.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: And what were you doing out at the missile
silo?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m an old friend of Cochrane’s… I wanted to
see how he was doing.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Lucky for him you came by when you did. He
might be dead now.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Maybe you can tell me what he’s been doing
in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I think he was running a test on an old
rocket engine… and one of the fuel cells burst.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: You seem to have an answer for
everything.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Something wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Be sure you put that on. You need a lot of
protection around here.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Thank you. But I’ve never had much trouble
protecting myself.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Worf to Bridge. We’re in position.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: This is the Bridge. I’m releasing the
emergency force fields.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Worf to Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Riker here.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: There’s a dampening field in place on this
deck. Our tricorders are useless.</p>
<p><strong>ensign hawk</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Borg…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Worf to Bridge. We’re about to enter the
Environmental Control Room.</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Any sign of Data, or the Borg
themselves?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Negative. However, they’ve reconfigured the
ODN network… and re-routed all power on this deck into Environmental
Control.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Stand by, Commander Where’s Ensign Hawk?</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Worf? Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Something is very wrong, Commander. We’re
falling back.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Fire at will!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Fall back!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Go, go, GO!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Worf to Bridge – force fields!</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: What the hell happened down
there, Worf?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Commander… we have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Cochrane was going to use this solid rocket
booster to lift the ship into orbit. Before the warp drive took over…
everything would depend on these old chemical engines. Now here’s the
problem…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: This used to be the throttle valve assembly.
It controls the thrust of the engines. It’s been completely vaporized…
and without it, there’s no way to launch the ship.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Yeah… if I knew what it looked like. There’s
probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We need to launch this ship in under
eighteen hours… There must be some design schematics… blueprints…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: We’re tearing this place apart looking for
them… but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the
files…so far, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: If it was just part of the warp drive, I’d
know what to do. But this… it’s like trying to rebuild Orville Wright’s
airplane with canvass and sticks.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Yeah, I looked at these already.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: You can almost see the throttle assembly in
this one… but this guy walked in front of it when they took the
picture.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Could you reconstruct the throttle from a
photograph like this… if that man wasn’t blocking the view?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Maybe… Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a
clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven’t found any
other photos.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: If there are other photographs… I think I
may know how to find them.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Your resistance is… illogical. To us,
your neural net is simply another piece of technology. We will learn its
secrets.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I am the Borg.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a
collective consciousness. There are no individuals.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I am the beginning… the end. I am the
one who is many. I am the Borg.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: You are the guiding intelligence behind the
Borg…?</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Intelligence… ambition… desire… I bring
order to chaos…</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: It’s unfortunate we will have to destroy
you to obtain the information we need. You are a… unique lifeform.
Synthetic… and yet far more than a simple automaton. You have no idea
how close to perfection you are.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: How do you define perfection?</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: A blending of the organic and the
synthetic. The highest form of life in the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: An interesting definition. But it is not one
that applies to me. I am completely artificial. I have no organic
components.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Have you ever wondered what it’s like to
have flesh?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It is impossible to imagine sensations for
which I have no frame of reference.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: That… can change.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Set phasers to rotating modulation!</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: That’s it, they’ve adjusted – fall
back!</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: All right… we’ve lost control of eight decks…
three Cargo Bays… one Shuttlebay.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Do we have any idea how many Borg we’re
dealing with?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: We saw at least thirty…and there are
twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing… including Commander
Data.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We’ll have to assume they’ve been assimilated
into the Collective.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Even Data?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Data’s positronic net contains classified
information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: If they control Data, they control the
ship.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We can’t worry about that right now. Let’s
concentrate on what we can.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: To control the Enterprise, they’ll have to
gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering… or the
Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We have to cover both possibilities. We’ll
take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main
Engineering. Turn it into a fortress – nothing gets in.</p>
<p><strong>ruby’s voice</strong>: Shut that door!</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: What are you, an idiot? Didn’t you see the red
light was on?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Ah… yes… but, I didn’t realize that –</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Thank God this plate was already fixed.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Cochrane?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Yes… and I only had enough silver halide for
one shot. So you’re lucky you didn’t screw it up.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Did you need something?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes… I wanted to ask you about some
photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them… printed on
some kind of fabric.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Bed sheets. I used my last set of bed sheets
to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven’t seen a clean
piece of paper in five years.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Did you take any other pictures of the
rocket?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Sure. Why, did you want to buy them?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes. I don’t have any money right now, but I
may be able to get some.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: “Money.” So you can get dome money…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I can try.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’d have to try real hard. No one’s used
currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No… but sometimes I feel that way. What I
meant was, I’d be willing to trade for the photographs.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Trade. Okay. The photographs… for a straight
answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m an old friend… I met him when he was
doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in –</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: ’Fraid not.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’re not someone who lies very easily… so
it’s obvious when you do… at least to me.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Are you always sucha good judge of
character?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: The occipital fracture is widening… we’re
going to have to fuse the bones…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m a little worried about some of these
bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be
looking at a hemorrhage.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Were the two of you… involved?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: No… not like you and Doctor Crusher used to
be.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How did you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We can’t take any more X-rays until I can mix
up a new batch of the silver halide.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Can you do it tonight? We may have to
operate.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Sure. It’ll be ready by morning.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Ruby… I need to talk to you about those
photographs. It’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I’m sure it is. But it’ll have to wait until
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It can’t wait until tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Too bad. Besides, it’ll give you all night to
think up a new set of lies.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Double check each assault phaser… make certain
that the range setting is no more than thirty meters. We don’t want to
blast through the hull.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Are you sure you don’t want
something a little more… sophisticated, sir?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Mind your post, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Riker to Engineering. Mister Worf…the Borg
are approaching your position.</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: Understood. We’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Charge weapons!</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: They’re bypassing Engineering…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Where the hell are they going?</p>
<p><strong>borg queen’s voice</strong>: Data…</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: You’ve taken your first step toward
perfection. How does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I do not know what you are referring to.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: That’s because you haven’t been
properly… stimulated yet.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Do you know what this is, Data?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It would appear that you are attempting to
graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: What a cold description… for such a
beautiful gift.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Was that good for you?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It was… interesting.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Do it again… please.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You should pay closer attention to those
little red lights.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You know, I’d be perfectly justified in
shooting you right now.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’d say you already have.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Don’t flatter yourself. I take pictures of a
lot of junk.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Okay, let’s hear it. I’m sure you have a great
explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into
my house.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’re trying to repair Doctor Cochrane’s
ship. It’s been damaged and –</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Myself… and a few other friends of
Zephram’s.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Friends from Cornell…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Some.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Lie. That’s one. Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: A key piece of the ship has been destroyed…
and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows
us what it looked like.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is
it so urgent you couldn’t wait until morning?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We have to launch his ship by tomorrow
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Or…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Or the shielding around the plutonium core
will begin to deteriorate. Within a day, the entire silo will become so
radioactive that no one will be able to come near it for a hundred
years.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Lie. That’s two. One more, and I pull the
trigger.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Why are you being so difficult? All I’m
asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It’ll take five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: And all I’m asking for is the truth. That
would take five minutes. For all I know, you caused the explosions at
the silo… and now you’re trying to steal Zephram’s ship.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I am not a thief…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: No, you’re a petty burglar and a liar… You’re
no friend of Zephram’s. He is a great man. He’s not like you or me or
any of the other zombies walking around this town.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No. He’s a man with vision. He can see
beyond the problems that surround us. He knows there’s a better future
out there for everyone… a future where crime, poverty and war are things
of the past… a future where we reach out and seek our destiny in the
stars. I believe in that future, too, Ruby. I believe in it in every
fiber of my being. And I’m telling you… if we don’t launch that warp
ship tomorrow, there’s a very good chance that future will never
happen.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You won’t regret this.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: What are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: They appear to be modifying the deflector
dish.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they
could’ve taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Deflector dish… why the deflector dish…?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: It doesn’t make sense. The deflector is only
used for shielding and long range sensors…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Computer – magnify grid twenty- one
alpha.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: They’re re-routing the deflector power
conduits…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Computer – thermal enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: They’re connecting the conduits to subspace
communications…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: They’re converting the deflector dish into an
antennae…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: They may be trying to send a message to the
other Borg…the Borg in this time period…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: What kind of message?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: If it was me… I’d say “attack Earth now… in
the 21st century… they’ll be too strong in the 24th.”</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: We have to stop them from sending that
message.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Agreed. Options?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Destroy the deflector dish.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Can we aim our dorsal phasers at it?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We’ve lost control of all weapons systems…
Transporters are down… we can’t get to a Shuttlecraft… and it would take
us too long to fight our way down to deflector control…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: There is another way, Commander. Do you
remember your zero-G combat training?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: I remember it made me sick.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: What are you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go
outside for a little stroll…</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s voice</strong>: I’m almost afraid to say this,
Captain… but I think it’s going to work.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Where’s you get the alloy for the throttle
itself?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: They used copper pipes in their plumbing… so
I melted it down… and fused it with some tritanium from one of our
phaser casings. It’s not the strongest alloy… but it’s better than all
this crude aluminum and steel.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Mister Lange – have you brought the computer
systems back on-line yet?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Aye, Captain. This trinary language is pretty
archaic… but I think I understand it now.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s voice</strong>: Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship
will be here in less than two hours.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s voice</strong>: It’ll be tight, but we should make
it.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s voice</strong>: What about our warp signature? It
has to be strong enough for them to detect.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s voice</strong>: I’ve enhanced the plasma injectors –
don’t worry, they’ll see it.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s voice</strong>: Well, with any luck… the Vulcans
will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning… and Earth will never be
the same again.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: All right. I’d better start familiarizing
myself with the flight controls.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Doctor Crusher’s at the access hatch,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Let her in.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Let me get this straight… you’re from the
future… I’m about to change history… and all I have to do is sit here
and let you fly my ship?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: And people say I’m crazy…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I assure you, Doctor, that after today… no
one will ever call you that again.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Just do me a favor… bring my ship back in
one piece.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: That’s a promise.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Doctor… my name is Geordi La Forge. I’m an
engineer. Can I shake your hand?</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: I wish I could go with you. Is there
anything I can do to help?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Not really… but I do have about a thousand
questions I’ve always wanted to ask you.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Since time is short… why don’t you pick
the top ten and fire away?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You actually performed surgery…?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: It was an experience. Metal scalpels…
needle and thread…</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: But I had a little help. Surgical
transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his
brain.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How did Doctor Almack react to that?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: He was so confused by what I was doing, I
don’t think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: You think they’re still up there?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: If they’re not… we’d better get used to
living in Montana.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: That might not be so bad… at least for
you.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I saw the way you looker at her… and I know
that look.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby… our
fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: You want some advice? Don’t do this again.
You know exactly what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Beverly, there were many reasons why you and
I…</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: I’d call them excuses. And the first excuse
on both our lists was our “sense of duty.” We convinced ourselves that
it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It’s
not.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I have a ship to launch.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Different.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: My internal sensors tell me the ambient
temperature in the room is ten point two degrees Celsius… But my skin
tells me it is cold.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: My visual acuity has been reduced by
seventy-eight percent… and I can no longer perceive light beyond the
ultraviolet or the infrared… But I can see.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Until today… your emotions were trapped
inside an artificial shell. You didn’t know what it was to truly feel.
And there’s so much more for you to experience. I will guide you into a
world of sensation unlike anything you can imagine. All you have to do…
is give us access to your neural net.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No. I will not betray my friends.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: They’re not your friends… they’ve held
you back… kept you from your destiny…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: That is not true. They have tried to help
me.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Have they given you what I have given
you? Did they even try?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I… do not want this…</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: You’re becoming more human all the time,
Data. Now you’re learning how to lie.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I wish to… go back to the way I was.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: More lies.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Have you ever know a woman? Do you know
what it’s like to feel her breath on your face… her skin against yours…
flesh against flesh?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: My creator did not intend for me to experience
these things.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: I’m your creator now.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: You will have to realign the targeting array
of the quantum torpedo… and reprogram the warhead for the localized
detonation. There’s only one torpedo left…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: I guess I’d better get it right the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers
to rotating modulation.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Depressurize.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Activate magnetic constrictors.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Just a little queasy…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Try not to look at the stars… keep your eyes
on the ship.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: And Commander, whatever you do… do not vomit
in your exo-suit. It would be… unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: I’ll keep that in mind.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Over and under!</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Worf! I’m going to need at least five
minutes!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Understood!</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s voice</strong>: ATR setting…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s voice</strong>: Active.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s voice</strong>: Main bus…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s voice</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s voice</strong>: Initiate pre-ignition sequence.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s com voice</strong>: Pre-ignition sequence complete.
Going to internal power.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Acknowledged, Phoenix. You’re on internal
power and ready for lift- off.</p>
<p><strong>geordi’s com voice</strong>: Final launch sequence checks…
complete. Ready to begin final countdown.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Understood. Begin five minute countdown on
your mark.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Ready to make a little history?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Always am.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Phoenix to control. Initiating five minute
countdown… mark.</p>
<p><strong>lange’s com voice</strong>: Phoenix, we have a problem out
here. There’s a woman at the outer hatch… says her name’s Ruby Sloan and
she wants to see the Captain.</p>
<p><strong>lange’s com voice</strong>: What do you want me to do,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: We can’t let her in… she’ll see Cochrane
isn’t making the flight.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We can’t leave her out there. When the ship
launches… she’ll be killed.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Tell her to go back to Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: She’s a very… determined woman. Phoenix to
control. Mister Lange… let her in.</p>
<p><strong>lange’s com voice</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Ms. Sloane, if you’ll have a seat, I’ll let
you talk to –</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Commander, you’re five minutes are up!</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: The Borg are charging the subspace
emitters.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: How long until they can send a message?</p>
<p><strong>com officer</strong>: About seven or eight minutes.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Computer – this is Commander Deanna Troi.
Initiate self- destruct in six minutes, thirty seconds. Authorization
Troi, gamma six five. Enable.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Countdown underway. Self-destruct in
six minutes, twenty-five seconds…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No good, sir. They’re on internal power.
We can’t stop the launch from here.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: What about these doors?</p>
<p><strong>private</strong>: They’re locked down tight from the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: And those doors were made to withstand a
nuclear attack.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: One minute to launch.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm’s com voice</strong>: Mister Picard… this is
Lieutenant Scrimm. I’m going to have to insist that you shut down the
launch. You see, I know what you’re doing… and I’m not going to just
stand by and let it happen. Stop the launch, or I’ll kill every one of
your people out here… and I think you know who’ll be first.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Say hello…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Jean-Luc… remember that future we talked
about? It’s all that matters… Launch the ship.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Go ahead – launch it. Ruby will be here when
you get back… but she won’t have a whole lot to say.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Captain –</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: This is Picard. I’ve suspended the launch
sequence.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm’s com voice</strong>: Thanks. Now, why don’t you join
us and we’ll have a little talk?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Captain… we’ve got less than ten minutes
before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We’ve got to go now.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It’ll have to wait. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Geordi, can you see into the room?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: No… the door’s too thick.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Then we’ll just have to assume it’s still
there…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: What’s still there?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Get a tricorder. You’re going to have to
track my exact position in that room…</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Self-destruct in three minutes…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: The invasion plans.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Invasion.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: These people you’re calling “Vulcans”… who
are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of
weapons?</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Tractor beam engaged. We’ve got ’em,
Commander.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Prismify the beam. Get rid of that Borg.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Don’t look at the stars… don’t look at the
stars…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There is no invasion…</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: All right. You want the truth… The Vulcans…
are highly intelligent aliens.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm’s com voice</strong>: Aliens… that’s what I thought.
From where… Canada?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: From another planet. Oh, I almost forgot…
they have green blood and pointed ears.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: And you know all this… because you’re a
space-man too…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m afraid you’ve caught me. I am a
space-man.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Truth… he’s telling the truth…</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: You’re an entertaining man, Mister Picard.
But you’re also full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Now, Geordi!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Actually, you’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Now, tell your men to drop their
weapons.</p>
<p><strong>scrimm</strong>: Weapons… down.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Are you all –</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I think you have a plane to catch.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Self-destruct in fifeteen seconds…
fourteen… thirteen… twelve…</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Nine… eight… seven…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand
kilograms…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Altitude fifty kilometers…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Entering the upper ionospere…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There’s a red light on the second intake
valve.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Ignore it. We’ll be fine. Prepare for first
stage shut-down and separation on my mark…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Three… two… one… mark!</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: A Borg in all but name.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I am… grateful for what you have given me. But
I still do not wish to be assimilated.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: A universe of sensation is waiting for
you… don’t you want to explore it… with me?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Then take the final step… give me the
Enterprise… and we can be together… always.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No… I cannot.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: I’ve deactivated the sensory inputs.
That flesh on your body is just meat, now.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No… no, please… you cannot…</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: You must give me what I want… now.
Without the deflector dish, we can no longer send for an early invasion.
We must assimilate Earth ourselves. I need this ship.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Isn’t it better like this…?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Yes… but the Enterprise… my duty…</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: … is to yourself. Don’t make me hurt you
again…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No… no, it’s so… empty… please… give it back…
I need it…</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: And I need to control this ship. Let me
into your mind.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: In order to access my neural net… you will
need to create a positronic interface. I will tell you how.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: As they used to say… all systems are go.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: The Vulcans should be out there right now.
We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we’re
going to get their attention.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Bring the warp core on-line. I’ll lay in a
heading.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: The nacelles are charged… nuclear warhead
standing by. We’re ready to ignite the warp drive.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Engage.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Warp field looks good… structural integrity
holding…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Speed… twenty thousand kilometers per
second.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: I have to admit there was a moment there when
–</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Hold that thought.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Strong heart. Weak stomach.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Report!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: We’ve lost Bridge control!</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Emergency override!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I am re-routing Bridge command functions to
this location.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Eliminate their remaining defenses. I
will send Borg to assimilate the rest of the crew.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered
sensor range.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Vulcan?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Give me helm control.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Passing one-half light speed. The starboard
nacelle’s running a little hot…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: I’m on it…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: The inertial dampers are having trouble
compensating… I don’t think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Speed – two hundred, seventy-five thousand
kilometers per second.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: There’s no temporal shielding in here! We’re
starting to pick up relativistic effects!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: One minute to warp threshold…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Captain, the Enterprise!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise –
do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Their com system must still be down.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Well, I feel a whole lot better with them
out there. We may need some help.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I have repaired the weapons array. Phasers are
on-line.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: The targeting lock isn’t working.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I do not understand. The optical data network
has been repaired, and all systems are functioning.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Your diagnostics are in error. I need
weapons.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: The problem must lie in the interface between
Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to
handle the data flow.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Can you configure it?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Approaching light speed…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: They’re getting awfully close… what the hell
are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’re crossing the threshold!</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I believe I see the problem.</p>
<p><strong>– data whirls around and slams an arm into one of
the</strong>: BORG DRONES. The drone is knocked off its feet.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Bring us about…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Dropping out of warp.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Let’s begin the landing procedure.</p>
<p><strong>borg queen</strong>: Data…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s voice</strong>: Isn’t anyone going to say welcome
back?</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Mister La Forge… now I’d like to shake
your hand.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Captain’s log, March 3rd, 2063. The voyage
of the Phoenix was a success… again.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: And it appears the Vulcan ship has detected
the warp signature and is now on its way to Earth.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Doctor Cochrane… this is your moment.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: My God… they’re really from another
world?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: That’s right. And they’re going to want to
meet the man who flew that warp ship.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: And that’s supposed to be me…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Zephram, you had the vision to build that
ship when no one else on this planet could see beyond their own
problems. You flew that ship… all I did was push a few buttons.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: All right. And don’t worry – I’ll keep
your secret.</p>
<p><strong>vulcan</strong>: Live Long and Prosper.</p>
<p><strong>cochrane</strong>: Um… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Riker to Enterprise. Five to beam up.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’re leaving, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I have to…</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Where? And don’t tell me San Francisco…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No. It’s a lot further than that.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: It’s the future, isn’t it? Just like you told
Scrimm. I knew you weren’t from around here.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No… I’m from France.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I don’t care if you’re from France or Venus…
just take me with you.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: This may be hard for you to understand… but
I’m duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here… any more
than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: You’ve been interfering with my life ever
since I met you. Don’t stop now.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Ruby… I’m sorry. But our fates lie along
different paths.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Picard to Enterprise. One to…</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Riker here. Captain, we didn’t
get your whole transmission.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: To hell with fate.</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Say again, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Enterprise. Two to beam up.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How’s Mister Data?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: He’s in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher says he can
be repaired… but we have to wait until we…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Return to our own time?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Then make it so. Have you determined how to
recreate the temporal vortex?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Yes, sir. But Captain… are we… all going
back?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Unless you’d like to stay.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge…
initiate the temporal vortex.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command.
Admiral Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Onscreen.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Admiral… what’s the status of the Borg
fleet?</p>
<p><strong>admiral hayes</strong>: It’s been destroyed. The Borg threat
is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors
for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’re fine, sir. It will take some… time to
explain.</p>
<p><strong>admiral hayes</strong>: I look forward to reading your
report.</p>
<p><strong>ruby</strong>: That makes two of us.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: No, no – we’ll have to rip out this entire
bulkhead. We’ll need new bracing members for the deck above and
below.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Data…</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: You look good as new.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: You could say that I’m back to my old
self.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Her remains… are they still here?</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: I’m sending them to the Daystrom Institute
for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I never realized how powerful an emotion
temptation could be.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: Temptation? You said in your report it was
all a ruse… you were manipulating her.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: She was… a unique lifeform. In her own way…
nearly perfect.</p>
<p><strong>geordi</strong>: It almost sounds like you miss her.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
