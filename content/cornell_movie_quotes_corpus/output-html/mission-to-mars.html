<h1 id="mission-to-mars">mission-to-mars</h1>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: T minus ten, nine, eight, start ignition
sequence, five, four, three, two, one, ignition… Liftoff!</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: My turn! My turn! No, I was next! No, me!
Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can I do one? I want to do one!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Guys, guys, please! This is risky stuff here.
And I’m a highly trained professional.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch another
booster…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: …just as soon as he completes his fuel
intake.</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: It’ll take us six months just to get to
Mars. Another year on the surface, then six months back. That’s two
years…</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: I guess what I’m trying to say is, since
this is my last night on Earth, it’s gonna be a very precious memory to
me. Y’know?</p>
<p><strong>pretty girl</strong>: Nice try, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won’t be
heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp
with Mars Two. That’s a pretty good long rendezvous.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: What are you suggesting, Sergei?</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: Maybe you should bring a baseball bat. Yes?
American baseball? Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar
System Series.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Please. Half you guys are foreigners. We’d
crush you.</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: No, no, we have equal crews. Three men, one
woman. Same handicap.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Easy now, you’re talking about my wife. And
Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own
strikes. Thousand bucks make it interesting?</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: Eh bien. Winner take all.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Good. Bring some balls.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You wanna know the sad part? Technically I
outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I’m gonna be
saying a lot of “Yes, dears.”</p>
<p><strong>1st wife</strong>: …just not sure how I feel about NASA
allowing couples to go on this type of mission together.</p>
<p><strong>1st wife</strong>: Nothing personal, Terri. It’s just that,
well, it’s kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: All the research shows that marriage will
provide stability on these long duration trips.</p>
<p><strong>2nd wife</strong>: Then they haven’t studied some of the
couples I’ve known.</p>
<p><strong>3rd wife</strong>: Anybody seen Jim McConnell?</p>
<p><strong>4th wife</strong>: I don’t think he’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>1st wife</strong>: God, that poor man. How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>2nd wife</strong>: Totally losing it, from what I hear. Can’t
sleep, can’t eat. Visits her grave almost every day. They say he could
lose mission status.</p>
<p><strong>3rd wife</strong>: Oh, that’s so sad. That is just so tragic.
You go to a routine physical one day, and wham.</p>
<p><strong>4th wife</strong>: After all those years of training, too. It
was their whole dream.</p>
<p><strong>1st wife</strong>: Must be a pretty funny feeling for Luke
Graham. Y’know? Now he’s gonna be in the history books. First man on
Mars…</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: He’s not coming, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Jim deserves this, too. All his friends are
here. And it’s my last night.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Your last night with us, too.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I love you, Deb.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: I love you too, baby. But maybe you should
spend some time with Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah. I will. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Up in his fort.</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. But I
guess I’ll have my memories to keep me warm…</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Who’s gonna read to me now, at bedtime?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Mommy will.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I like when you do it. Now we’re never gonna
finish our book.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ve been thinking
about that. And what I thought was – how ’bout if I bring along my own
copy? Then every night, wherever I am, I’ll read a little bit more of
it. And I’ll know that you and Mommy, wherever you are, you’re reading
it too. That way, it’ll feel like we’re still reading it together.
’Cause I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty anxious to find out how
’ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island. What d’you say?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Good deal. Can I have a hug?</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: We were afraid you wouldn’t come.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I caught a whiff of your barbecue. After
that I was helpless.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: All the way out in Galveston?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Something like that. It’s his night, Deb.
I didn’t want to spoil it.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Spoil it? He’s been going crazy looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: C’mon. A whole lot of folks here are gonna be
mighty glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I wish we were all going. Together.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Then you’ve got a short memory. Think back to
how we were by the second week of lunar training.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Oh, you’re not gonna bring that up again
–</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m trying to remember, let’s see, which one
of us scored the lowest ranking up there?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You just can’t let that go –</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship?
If they sent us off to Mars together, there wouldn’t be enough fuel to
lift all those egos.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Bullshit, we would’ve made a great crew.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That was never gonna happen. I was always
teamed with Maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. You know?
Systems. Payloads…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time Magazine!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Yeah, who landed the crippled Block II
Shuttle?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar
rankings?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Let it go, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Sure, I made a little noise. But putting
the first footprints on Mars? Nah. That’s for guys who… …wrote their
Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place. And guys who… …read too much
science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships
around their necks.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You read the same damn science fiction books
that I did! You’re just not man enough to wear jewelry!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You want Flash. You know you want him. Well
you’ll have to come through me!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: God, she would’ve loved to see you two
clowns. Just one more time.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey, Woodrow, isn’t it about time you donated
this thing to a museum?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Internal combustion, boys. Accept no
substitutes.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jim, if there’s ever… if there’s anything
Terri and I can do –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m okay. Really. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: See you when I get to Mars, Luke. Don’t solve
all the mysteries of the universe, okay? Leave a little something for
the next guys.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’ll see what I can do. Just make sure you
bring some fresh beer.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Should’ve been your mission, Jim. Yours and
Maggie’s.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: None of us ever wanted Mars the way you two
did. Not even Woody. Twelve years of hoping for this assignment,
training for it –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That’s all over now.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: If Maggie hadn’t gotten sick – if you hadn’t
pulled yourself out of the rotation to take care of her –</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, I’m gonna say this. I have to say it… I
wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled you for it every step of the way. Never
wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life. But not like this… Jim, I’d
give this all up in a second, if it would bring Maggie back to us.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I know that, Luke. You don’t have to say
it… Mars is yours now. Go get it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Yeah. You too.</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: Luke, you read me?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, Renee.</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: Luke, I just got ARES-8 on line and… Well, we
think you’re gonna wanna see this for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: No idea, boss.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: You don’t wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: C’mon, what’s so funny? Gimme the
coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: Latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 9 degrees
west.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: The Plains of Cydonia. So? Oh no. You’re not
telling me –</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: Oui. Exactement! It’s Kirov’s fault, he picked
today’s sector.</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: Hey, c’mon! We’ve got a scientific duty to
check that thing out.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Great. That’s great. The first anomaly we hit,
and it’s gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make NASA look
ridiculous… You know how many books have been written about that damned
mountain?</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: The Egyptians put it there.</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: No, the Amazons.</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: No, it was little green men!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And all because a couple of lousy impact
craters happen to look like eye sockets. If this gets out, we’ll have
every UFO kook on Earth spouting off on the six o’clock news… C’mon,
people, gimme a read here. Is that a cinder cone?</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic
upwelling?</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: No fissures. No caldera.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s an upwelling, for sure. But maybe not
volcanic…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Look at the color. And see how shiny it is? I
could swear that’s ice…</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: This far south?</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Impossible. You can’t have ice at this
latitude. Not unless…</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: How far away is it?</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: Sixteen kilometers northeast. Take us twenty
minutes to get there.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Let’s send a packet to Micker. Then we’ll go
check it out.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: This is a truly anomalous formation. Looks
like nothing we’ve seen so far. The structure appears to be crystalline,
at least from the angle displayed by ARES-8 …</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We’re all trying not to go too nuts up here,
but – we think there’s a good chance this could be an extrusion from
some subsurface, geothermal column of water. And if we’re right…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …then we’ve found the key to permanent human
colonization.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Tell geology and hydrology we need to
scramble on this. Full-court press.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Anyway, we’are going out to take a closer look
at it, try to get an idea of its composition. By the time you receive
this, we should be just about on-site.</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Anyone else hear that?</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: Yeah. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Sounds like our antenna’s out of phase.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Can you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Hey, skip, I can fix anything.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let’s break out the
radar, see what this thing’s made of.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: …and this is the Mars Mission Control Room,
nicknamed “Micker.” I understand a comm packet is incoming from Mars One
Base Camp, so you may find this interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: That man over there. He’s in charge?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No, actually, that’s Jim McConnell, the
CAPCOM. Our voice link to the astronauts? Jim’s been with the manned
Mars program since its inception. One of our real pioneers.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador</strong>: Will he be going to Mars, too?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Ah, no. This is as close as he gets.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …anyway, that’s about it. We’ll send another
packet when we get back.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, right. One more thing. Today is a very
special day for a good friend of ours, and I know he’s there right
now.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Now, he hates it when any fuss is made, so I
won’t mention his name…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …because the last thing in the world I’d ever
want to do is embarrass someone like Jim McConnell.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: C’mon, you Micker weasels, sing!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he all red
with one of those fake “I’m- a-good-sport” grins?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And hey, you guys, check out Ray! Does he have
on one of his “This- wasn’t-in-my-mission-plan” faces?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nothing you can do about it, Ray! We’re a
hundred million miles away!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Catch you again soon. Take care, buddy. End of
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well? What’s under there?</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: Je ne sais pas. I… I think there’s something
wrong with the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: I mean, it can’t be right. It says… it says
there’s metal under there.</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: There’s ten, twelve meters of rubble and sand,
and then… solid metal.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That doesn’t make any sense. You’re reading a
vein of ore.</p>
<p><strong>cote</strong>: No. It’s under the whole mountain.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nick, could the problem with the antenna be
interfering?</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Try it closer and up the power. I’ll watch the
screen.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Ah, we’re all pretty stoked about that
formation you spotted, Mars One. The folks in the geology and hydrology
back rooms are going over your images and comparing them to every
photomap they’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nick, how we coming on that antenna?</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Goin’ as fast as I can, boss.</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I am. I
can’t get this to work.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Medical wants me to remind you that
you’re three days late on your blood tests. I know they’re a bore, but
you’ve got to get them done, or else… or else I don’t know what. Just do
them, okay?</p>
<p><strong>kirov</strong>: All set here, chief.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Okay. Crank up the juice and let’s see what’s
in this sucker.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I think that’s about it for business. But
on a personal note, be advised that, ah, none of you can sing worth a
damn.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Why did that stop?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Honestly, Luke, if you guys don’t have
anything better to do with your time, I can make some suggestions to
mission medical. There are worse things than blood tests.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Oh, and I talked to Debra. She and Bobby
are doing fine. Said to tell you, they’re, ah, they’re on their “third
time through the book, page – – page 125.” They send their love and say
take care of yourself. Same from us here, buddy. Till next time, then.
End of transmission.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: “Problem: Hatch door malfunction, backup
power fail, manual override fail. Solution: Replace circuit breaker
907B.”</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Okay… Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: God, who dreams up these nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Don’t try to change the subject.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I’m not! We’re talking about your sister’s
wedding, right?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Very funny. We’re talking about dancing
lessons. Before my sister’s wedding.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Honey, do you mind? I’ve got a catastrophic
power failure here.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody, we’re a married couple. Would it kill
you to invite me out on the floor once in awhile?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I danced with you at our wedding.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’m not talking about shuffling your feet
around while you grab my butt. I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba,
jitterbug –</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Face it, honey, some couples dance, some go
to Mars. That’s life.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’m serious. We’ve got two more months in
this training rotation, but just as soon as we get home, we’re starting
lessons. If we never dance, people will think there’s something
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: If they see me dance, they’ll know there’s
something wrong.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: You are such a lug.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Cockpit, this is Control.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Control, this is Cockpit.</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: Uh, Terri, they want us all back in
the Station. Report to Micker.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Who says report to Micker?</p>
<p><strong>phil’s voice</strong>: The little men who live in my
head.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Phil, c’mon! We just started this drill.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me to round up
the team. Now.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Then, at 1417, the X-band continuous data
stream from Mars went silent. All data – med, environmental, everything
– suddenly stopped. While we were trying to figure out what the hell
went wrong, we got a signal from the folks at the Large Array at
Soccoro.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: At the same moment we lost the data
stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from Mars.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: What do you mean, “intense”?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What about the crew?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: The level of energy in the pulse… didn’t seem
survivable.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: What about the REMO? It went into Mars orbit
last week. Maybe that could give us some clue.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Good thinking, Woody. That’s just what we
tried next.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: The Resupply Module checked out fine. No
instrument failures, no change in status. Orbit holding steady. But
there was something else. The REMO’S computer contained an uplink
message – a very faint, highly distorted transmission from Mars One Base
Camp.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Someone’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: The message is almost indecipherable. Two
teams are still working on it. You better see for yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Still concentrating on the audio. We
managed to bring out a couple more words, but we’ve got a long way to
go.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Show us whatever you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …make this quick… may be only ch– …to the
site, when we… hit us just as we… –thers are all dead…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …low sound that we couldn’t understand. Then
all of a sudden there was this terrib… …–stems are holding up for now,
but I don’t know how long I can…</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What did Luke mean by a “low sound?”</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: If this was a earthquake, as we’re now
assuming, there’s usually an auditory component.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: But that energy pulse they picked up in New
Mexico…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Electromagnetic emission. Not uncommon with
large-scale geophysical phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Causing this kind of damage? I don’t buy it.
We’re missing something here.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Luke must be in pretty bad shape if he hasn’t
blasted out of there in the Earth Return Vehicle. That thing’s designed
so even one crew member could fly it back to Earth.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Even if Luke was in great shape, he
couldn’t get home. That energy pulse would’ve fried the ERV’S
computers.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Other than the computers, how do we think the
ERV fared?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Well, so far our modelling says it should be
in pretty good shape.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Which means it’s gonna be up to us to get new
motherboards, drives, and software to Mars. As fast as we can.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Whoa, slow down. It’s gonna take us weeks just
to analyze this data.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Right, but meanwhile, we’ve gotta be
working up a mission plan.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Luke needs us now.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Luke may already be dead. And even if he’s
not, it’s doubtful he’s going to be able to transmit again. So we
wouldn’t know whether it’s safe to land until you were almost there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What about SIMA?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The Saturn Imaging Probe. It’s going to
slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system. It could be
retasked to take pictures, read radiation levels at Mars One Base
Camp.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us Luke hasn’t
survived and it’s not safe to land, we swing around Mars and come right
back home.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Yes. We can design the mission to have a
free return capability. It’s a long trip, but if you don’t land it’s the
best option.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We’re getting ahead of ourselves. You’re
forgetting the bigger problem. The orbits are all wrong. Our first
decent launch window is almost eight months from now.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: But we can go earlier and get there
faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel. We’ve modelled
that, Ray. I’ve modelled it.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: On paper, yeah. But those stresses have never
been tested in space.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: The ship can take it.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I wasn’t thinking of just the ship.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I know the protocols for a Mars Recovery
Mission better than anybody, because I helped design them. And I’m
saying these guys can do it.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: He’s right, Ray. We’ve got a real shot.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Give me an updated mission plan by 0800
tomorrow. Then I’ll put it in the works.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: You’ll have it by 0600.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Chief, could I have a word?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I’ve no longer got the right crew.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What do you mean? Bjornstrom can be up here on
the next shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Bjornstrom is a geologist. He’s good, but not
for this. My people just lost eight months of training. This is a
different mission, with a different objective.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I haven’t been given authorization for a
mission yet.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: But when you are, it ought to be given the
best chance for success. I want McConnell to fly right seat.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: He’s no longer on mission status.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Yeah. Because you washed him out.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: He washed himself out. He only had to pass a
few more psych evaluations, but he refused to take them.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Ray, he’s the best pilot I ever saw, and
you’ve got him benched at a desk.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Everybody has to pass the psych prelims. No
exceptions. Jim knew that.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Maggie was his wife. He didn’t want to lie on
a couch and share her with strangers.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: That was his call. But I had to make one too.
It was tough as hell, but I’d do it again.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: His wife wasted away in front of his eyes.
What was he supposed to do? Suck it up? Get with the program? What was
his crime? That he was upset? That he cried…?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I couldn’t trust him!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Not in a crisis… I’m sorry Woody, but Jim lost
his edge. Are you gonna stand there and tell me Jim McConnell is the
same man he was two years ago? You want me to bet four more lives on
that?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit
out of him. It knocked the hell out of all of us. But you know and I
know that he’s still the best we’ve got. He and Maggie wrote the book on
Mars. He’s got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together.
Ray, we can do this. Give me McConnell as co-pilot, and we will bring
Luke home. And that’s a promise.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That… is the exact chemical composition of my
ideal woman.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Used to be.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Now what is it?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: A frog.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I guess now we have our answer to the effects
of long-term interplanetary travel on the human mind. The answer is
Phil.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m gonna get an update on SIMA. It
should be just about close enough to start capturing some surface
images.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Hey, Skip.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: What do you make of that?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Dust storm. Southern hemisphere, coming
from the east… Big fella, too.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Headed for Chryse Planitia.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Yup. Could get a little hairy just about
landing time…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: We’ll have to be ready to move fast. Maybe
even advance our ETA. Those things can cover the whole planet, and last
up to a year.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: When does SIMA do her fly-by?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That’s when we
find out whether we came all this way for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: My money’s on Luke.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What brought this on?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. Once
we’re in Mars gravity, it’s back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her
butt.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’ll take what I can get.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Attention. Incoming packet.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: It’s SIMA.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Looks deserted.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s still standing, though. So is the ERV.
And look, there’s the greenhouse.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We know Luke survived for at least a few
hours. Question is, are there any signs of recent activity?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell are those?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Graves.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hold on. There’s only three. That means –</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Phil –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It means Luke must still be –</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: No. It just means there was nobody left to
bury him.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Check the radiation levels.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Normal.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Go to the disaster site.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know. Magnetic interference?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Go to infrared.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Must be a problem with SIMA. I don’t see how
an earthquake, six months ago, could give us this kind of
distortion.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That was no quake.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Then what the hell was it?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We’re going to continue analyzing this data
and try to determine what the problem is with those images. Frankly,
we’re just as stumped as you guys, but we’ll keep on it. We agree that
the evidence of the graves is inconclusive and that a ground search is
advisable. Be aware there are little sand storms kicking up near Mars
One Base, but the big one you spotted is turning south. It shouldn’t be
a factor.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We’re all pretty excited here and we’re sure
you must be feeling the same. Enjoy your meal and get a good night’s
sleep. We anticipate that tomorrow morning you will be Go for Mars
Orbital Insertion.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: God bless you and goodnight. End of
transmission.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What if you opened up your meal packs and
found that, instead of putting in everything but red ones, they’d made a
mistake and put in only red ones?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, that’s a funny notion. And what if in
your meal packs, instead of brown rice, there were spring-loaded spikes
that shot into your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: How did you ever pass the psych
evaluation?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: When you’re schizophrenic, they take the
higher score.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Jim’s first ship was seriously
underpowered…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Maggie was always starstruck…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’ll get you guys for this.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: When they met at the Air Force Academy, it was
“love at first flight.”</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: After that, NASA training was tough. All Jim
could think about was exploring a heavenly body. More ribald LAUGHTER,
as</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But Maggie, as you can see, kept him on a
short leash. Until…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Mission accomplished!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Today we celebrate a new chapter in their
story. And guys, it’s a pretty historic one.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Let’s hear it for the newly-announced Captain
and Co-Captain of Mars One. To Jim and Maggie!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: When you guys land, it’ll prove once and for
all there’s no intelligent life on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hey, c’mon, what if I’m right?</p>
<p><strong>assorted voices</strong>: Oh no, here we go! Don’t get her
started! Somebody put on some music!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s our sister planet!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh brother!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Maggie, why does this have to be about us?
Mars is a great opportunity for pure science.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: We’ll do the science. And we’ll do it very
well. That’s what we’ve trained for. But what if there’s more…? In all
our myths, in every human culture, Mars has always held a special
attraction. What if that means something? Only we don’t understand it
yet…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: The universe is not chaos. It’s connection.
Life reaches out for life…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: This is what we were born for, isn’t it? To
stand on a new world, and look beyond it to the next one. It’s who we
are.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Yeah. I’m good to go.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: After all these years… Can you believe
it? Tomorrow we’ll be standing on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You know what? She may have been right.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: If that wasn’t a quake down there, then
something else caused it. Or planned it… You’re thinking the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: It’s never been out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jesus. You realize what this means?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: She knew, Woody. She was the only one of
us that ever thought there might be something down there.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Yeah, and we’re not leaving until we find
out… Deal?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Maggie was the best of us.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Range 6783 and closing. 35 minutes till
Mars Orbital Capture.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Okay, people let’s look sharp. If we
overshoot, there’s no coming back.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, and drifting through eternity will ruin
your whole day.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Delta V systems initialized.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Charge primary APU.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Engaged. Charged.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Select HPU fuel cells for run.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Engaged.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Tie main bus to systems.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Power ready.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Select H2/O2 HPU and fuel cells for
open.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: H2/O2 control valves open.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Charge flow.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Charged and on-line</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Reset PW.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Set</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Transfer protocol data from EVA
station.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Transferred. Awaiting track confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uhhh!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What in God’s –</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Micrometeoroids</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Breach hits in the hull!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Outgassing! Losing pressure!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody, seal the breech!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Kill those alarms!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Still outgassing in the lower Hab! There
must be another hole down there, even bigger.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Losing pressure fast! We’re gonna
decompress!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Computer, how long until zero atmosphere?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Four minutes, nine seconds.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If we get below 20% atmosphere, the power will
shut down!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Positive! A vacuum inside the ship would cause
a total electrical failure. The nav computers will fry!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We’ll lose all control. We won’t be able
to fire the engines to capture Mars orbit.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s already starting. The primary L- 1 hub
has been smashed. The systems are crashing.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Everybody switch to suit oxygen. We beat this
in the simulator, we can do it here. Jim, you’ve got the ship. I’m going
EVA.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: C’mon, people, let’s go! Let’s work the
problem!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus, it’s still bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Keep the pressure on!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Eighty percent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Jim, you’ve gotta get your spare helmet from
storage.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: No time. Phil, can you keep the nav
computers on-line?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I can’t get this damn machine to re-
initialize! And the automated systems just went down. We can’t shut down
the hab rotation from here.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’ll do it from below.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: We’re losing pressure. You could
embolize.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Seventy percent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jim, I’ve got an idea. If you guys can save
enough atmosphere, I’ll disconnect the power in the main computer bay,
then jump start the systems. I’ll do a hard boot.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Has that ever been tested?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Are you kidding? These machines are much too
valuable.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jim, how we doin’ on the AG?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Just one goddamn second. Come on,
c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Voice print identification.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: McConnell!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Accepted. Shutting down artificial
gravitational rotation.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Sixty per cent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Get some light on the hole so I can locate
it.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’ve got a better idea. Stay there!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I’m topside, Jim, do you know which
sector?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m workin’ on it!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jesus, uh, OK, this is gonna be like
searching for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Shake out the liquid.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Jim, I don’t –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Shake it out near the hull!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, where are you…?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Fifty per cent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Woody, the breech is in sector four!
Sector four, copy that?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Copy, I’ heading there now.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Sonofabitch. You never did that in the
simulator.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Where are you, you little bastard, where are
you…?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Forty percent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Thirty percent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Twenty percent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK… OK now…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Come on. Come on…!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Twenty percent atmosphere…</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Pressure stabilizing… Atmosphere level
increasing.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes! Awriiiight! Had it all the way. Yes!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Get back in here, guys!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jim, there’s a lot of scarring… I’d better
check for other punctures while I’m out here.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Negative, negative. Woody, get back
inside. We’ve gotta start the checklist for orbital insertion.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Copy, I’m heading there now.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Hey, Beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Know what? You’ve got enough left.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Piece of cake?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Well. Easier than the cha-cha.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know what you’re getting so cocky
about. We scored better times in the sim at least twice.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: How’s his hand?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Seems OK. Couple of the tendons are going to
be a little tight for awhile. Try to close your fingers, Phil, nice and
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, at least I’ll still be able to
drive.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: OK, we’re ready to light this candle. Go/No
Go for braking burn and MOI. Engines?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Systems.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Nav.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: We are Go for the burn. I’m fueling the
engines.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Optimum angle of entry minus seven degrees.
Six… Five…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Four… Three…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jim?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Let’s go to Mars.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: What the –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Shut down engines!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Engines negative! No response! I’ve got no
attitude control!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Manual separation! Blow the bolts!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Negative! The CM doesn’t have enough thrust
to correct this rotation!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’re too steep! Falling into the
atmosphere…!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Christ, at this angle we’ll burn up!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: How much time’ve we got?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know! Three minutes? I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Where’s the REMO?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The Resupply Module? Why? That’s not –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Where is it?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh, it’s close…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Damn it, how close?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I-I don’t know. It’ll take time…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We don’t have time! Figure it out!
Now!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jim, we’re dead stick, there’s no way to
maneuver this ship into a link-up!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Not the ship. Just us. We have to go</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You want us to transfer in suits?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Jesus, Jim – if we don’t make it – if we miss
the REMO…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: There’s no other choice! Phil, how
close?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: One kilometer, that’s the best I can do!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Prepare to abandon ship.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: On my mark, seven percent left thruster.
Three, two, one, fire.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Okay. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What’re you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Earth.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Hey. When we get back? We really will have to
try this in the sim.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: How we doin’ on fuel, Woody?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I’m at fifty percent. But I don’t see the
REMO.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: There she is!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Jesus. She’s not where I thought she’d
be.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’re going to miss her.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: We can’t catch it. Not like this.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Use the tether.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We’ll only have one, maybe two shots
before she’s out of reach.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: It’ll be better if I leave you the gun while
I run out to the REMO. I’ve got enough fuel left for that.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: You’ll be going too fast.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I’ll aim to overshoot, then brake like hell;
arc it in.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Seeya in a few.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Okay. I’m on path to overshoot. I’m gonna
take the edge off.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I’m out. Coming in hot. Still long.
Abandoning the unit. I’ll brake with suit jets.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Oh Jesus. Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Suit jets gone. But I’m gonna make
contact…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: At what velocity?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Impact’s gonna be a little rough.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: At what velocity?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Thirty-two.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m gonna use the gun to slow you.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: No! You slow me and I’ll fall short.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: It’s too fast, Woody.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: No choice. I’ll be okay. Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody!!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Woody, what’s your status?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Uh, well, no suit jets and I’m still carrying
a good deal of velocity.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: As soon as we get hooked up, I’ll come
get you.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Uh, I’d have to say negative on that,
Jim.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Negative on the transmission?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: No, I heard you. Negative on the maneuver. I
am not retrievable.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody, that’s not possible. You’re not going
that fast.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: It comes down to the amount of fuel, honey.
The suit jets were designed for attitude control, not travel. Retrieval
just won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It has to work!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Hey, believe me, I don’t like it any more
than you do.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody –</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Run the numbers, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Woody, you hang tight. We’ll get into the
REMO, fire her up, drop her into a lower orbit and come scoop you
up.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Sounds good, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: It’s gonna take half an hour to get the REMO
reoriented! Woody’ll be… He’ll be in the atmosphere by then!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Then we’ll have to get her moving
faster.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: We don’t have time!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: You listen to Jim, honey. It’s a good
plan.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: No! We are going to –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh Jesus, look! The ship!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Brakes!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Okay, let’s get inside! Phil, start
dumping the cargo, or there won’t be room for us.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But we need those supplies for –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Will do, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Hey, Beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Terri, no!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Goddammit, Terri, it won’t work!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Terri, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’m not doing, Woody. I’m
not going to watch you die.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Terri –</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: You’d do the same for me.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Get inside. Dump the cargo, then start
the systems. Now.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: No. I wouldn’t come for you. Not if it just
wasn’t possible.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I can do it!</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: No, Terri, you can’t! You don’t have enough
fuel to get me, stop us both, and get us back. Hell, you come any
farther and you won’t have enough to get back yourself.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Listen to me, goddammit! You have to stop!
You have to stop now!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: He’s right, Terri… It’s no use.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Okay, honey…? You gotta go back now.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: The hell I do.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’m gonna jet a little closer and try
again.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Terri, you spend any fuel getting closer, you
won’t get back, and if anyone tries to get you, they’ll die too.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Honey, please go back. Go back and help
everyone get down to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I am not losing you.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I can’t let you do it. I can’t. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody…?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: I love you, Terri. God how I love you.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody, nooooooo…!!!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Woody, oh Woody, please God, no!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Come back, Terri.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Please, Terri… We need you.</p>
<p><strong>new capcom</strong>: Okay, they’re Go for the burn and MOI.
Should be initiating the burn just about… now.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Phil? Hey, Phil…?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We’re going in blind. We’ll deploy the
chutes by laptop. I need to get on the data bus, put in a software
patch, and try to soften this tin can’s landing. I could use your help
with the patch.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That’s great. Good job. Hey, Terri, I was
wondering. Think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those
cargo straps?</p>
<p><strong>new capcom</strong>: Ray…? We’ve got some new data, just
coming in.</p>
<p><strong>new capcom</strong>: We just – it doesn’t make any sense.
We’re not sure how to read this.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Data?</p>
<p><strong>new capcom</strong>: Yes sir. Telemetry reports the REMO has
left its orbit and reached the Martian surface.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Crashed?</p>
<p><strong>new capcom</strong>: No sir. Under power.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>new capcom</strong>: Sixty-three minutes after Mars Recovery
went off-line. Sir, the graph reads like a controlled descent. But that
doesn’t make any –</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: They used the REMO as a lander.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: It’s McConnell, it’s got to be! Nobody else
could have pulled this off. Son of a bitch! They’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Better?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Damn right.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Terri, let’s see if that oxygen still is
operational. Phil, you better check out the ERV. I’ll take the Hab. If
you find Luke’s –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Just keep in touch.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m at the main airlock door.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Entering Hab.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ve got ERV access. I’m going in. Terri, you
okay?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to get back
to 100% capacity.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: ERV appears structurally intact. Computers are
fried, just as we thought.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Copy that. I’ve got busted filters here,
clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup job, but so far no major damage.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m in the greenhouse. You better… you
better come see this for yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Jim…?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Luke, it’s me! Jim McConnell!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re not here!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Luke, it’s Jim!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, no, you’re not… you can’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby!
You were reading Treasure Island with him…!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Don’t hurt him!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Phil… Terri…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Jim… I don’t understand. You’re not supposed
to be here… Why are you here? Where’s Woody?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: He didn’t make it Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Luke, what happened here?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We fired the radar. It came. They all
died.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What came?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: They all died, but I was spared. Why? Had to
be for a reason. Then, all of a sudden, I knew why I was spared.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: So somebody would be left to figure out the
secret.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Luke, we still don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Come. Comecomecome.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Is it just me? Or is he about two mealpacks
short of a picnic?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Long term exposure to low gravity can have an
adverse impact on the brain. He could be suffering from a form of
asphyxia.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Or maybe his whole crew died and he’s
been marooned alone on Mars. Let’s give him time to adjust.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Greatgreatgreat.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: So… let me be sure I understand this. Your
ship blew up, with all its supplies. Then you emptied the cargo out of
the REMO, and it was totalled on landing. You’ve got no food, no water,
no spare oxygen, nothing but what I see here…?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What kinda rescue mission is this?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That kind.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Check it out. New nav boards for the ERV. I
got four round-trip tickets, baby, right in here.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Terri… I’m so sorry. He was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Thanks, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: When there’s time, we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: …When I came to and dug myself out of the
sand, my faceplate was cracked. Leaking badly. I barely made it back to
Base. It was weeks before I could work up the nerve to go back out there
and look for their…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Renee was the only one I could find. But it
didn’t seem right, somehow, to dig just one grave.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Has it been blowing like this for a
while? We saw a big storm from space. But Micker said it was turning
south.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: If it holds course.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: This – whatever it was – this force. You
say it came directly out of the top of the mountain?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You don’t believe me. That’s okay. But I’m not
crazy, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What did you mean by its “secret?” What
secret?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You better see for yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: See, where they made their mistake was, they
must’ve planned for it to be visible from Earth…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Who’s “they”?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Don’t you understand? Hundreds of millions of
years have gone by. You’ve got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, meteor
impacts – hell, in that much time, the whole surface would’ve changed.
So no wonder we never saw it before. Well, I mean, we saw it, but not
like they meant us too. Too much dirt on it.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Saw what?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What is that…?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t know. But whatever it is, somebody
built it. And not us.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What about the sound? That signal you
heard before the explosion?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Good, Jim, good. That’s the key.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hear the pauses? That’s what made me realize
it’s a pattern – a repeating pattern.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Mathematical?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s what I thought. There are distinct
blocks in the pattern, and within each block the tones come in groups of
three. Threethreethree. For months I struggled to analyze it, trying
different constructs… Then I thought about dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: X-Y-Z coordinates…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Right! Three groups equals three dimensions…
So I tried assigning different graphic values to each block, group and
tone. And finally I got… this.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: My God… Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: DNA… that’s a model of DNA!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You see it, too. Thank God. I was afraid I was
just suffering from a form of asphyxia.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So, okay, so – somebody left this thing here,
somebody – other than human. But what the hell is it?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: My guess is, it’s a signature. A self-portrait
of whatever species created the Face.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: But that DNA looks human.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: No way. It’s missing the last pair of
chromosomes. See?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Yeah, but it’s close. Damn close.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: The difference between a man and an ape is
less than three percent of genetic material. But that three percent
gives you Mozart. Einstein.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Or Jack the Ripper.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: It’s been a long day. Let’s get a couple
hours sleep, then tackle this thing when we’re fresher. Phil, your first
priority will be to get the motherboards over to the ERV. Concentrate on
getting communications up first. Soon as we’ve got the juice, we’ll send
a packet to Micker, tell them Luke’s OK, and that… everything else
that’s happened. The rest of us will take an inventory of supplies, see
where we stand. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: C’mon. There’s a pair of scissors in my
medkit.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Like I just got back my other three
percent.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: The backup generator is salvageable, and two
of the solar panels. I’m pretty sure I can get the oxygen still back
into production, too. So we’re not in such bad shape, considering.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Good work, Terri.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Look at that. Phil’s idea of absolute
essentials.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: It’s not a signature.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That noise from the Face… It’s not a
signature. It’s a test.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: It’s asking us for the right answer. It
wants us to put in the missing pair of chromosomes.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: To prove that we’re human.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We fired radar into that thing. Concentrated
sound waves…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Which it interpreted as a wrong answer…
Yes! It’s like a, a security alarm. When it gets an incorrect response,
it defends itself.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So what happens when it gets the right
answer?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I don’t know. But we’ve got to find out.
Can you work this the other way? Figure out which tones would be
equivalent to the missing chromosomes? Then dub them into your recording
of the signal?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I think so, yes.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What about the radar gun? Will it accept
that input? Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if you’re
wrong? Whoever goes out there… I mean, what if you’re wrong? Three
people have already died over that thing.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Terri, if we leave here without getting
some answers, they all died in vain.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: We just don’t know enough about that – that
thing out there to take any more chances.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: What are we here for, if not to take
chances…?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: This means we’re not alone. It means
we’re on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankind’s history. But
we’ve still got to prove it. Who knows when someone else will get back
here? Or if they ever will? You know what Congress is like. They’ll say
it’s too dangerous, too much loss of life, let’s go back to unmanned
flights. We could be the last explorers to come here for decades. We’re
it, guys. We’re it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We don’t have to go out there. There’s a
better way.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Checking video feed…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: How close do we need to get?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m not sure. Maybe we better stop by that
boulder.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It worked… It worked!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Check for radiation.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Normal. Seismic… normal. Anemometer steady. No
sign of the vortex.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know what we did, but guys – does that
look to you like a hostile gesture?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: No. More like an invitation.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Or another test…</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Luke, the four-man rover. Does it still
work?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: How long before it hits?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: An hour? Maybe less.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: How bad?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: A storm like that? It could go planetary. And
last a year.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’ll sock us in, Jim. We won’t be able to
take off. If that happens, with what few supplies we’ve got left…? We’ll
starve to death.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Phil, how much longer to prep the</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Maybe forty-five minutes. It’ll be tight, but
we can make it.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Then there’s still time for us to get out
there and back.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Stay here. Continue the repair. If
something goes wrong, you get out of here before that storm hits.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Go back… alone?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: If we’re not back in forty-five minutes,
I want you to prep and launch. That’s 1950 hours.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jim –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: It’s not a suggestion, it’s an order. You
understand?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I understand. But –</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: You understand what?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If you’re not back by 1950, I prep and
launch.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Phil, do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, Jim. Your signal’s breaking up a little
in the storm, but I read you.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We’re at the Face. We’re gonna need a few
minutes here. Same deadline, launch at 1950. With or without us. Do you
copy?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Jim, are you sure you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m not sure of anything anymore. But I
didn’t come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten
feet.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Surface seems firm and level.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Roger that. Texture is smooth.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’ve got good footing and no obstructions.
Let’s check our –</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: It’s solid again! We’re trapped.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Don’t move! Keep this orientation.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Phil? Phil, can you still hear me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Computers are online! Ready to load software.
But guys – we’re losing visibility here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Guys…? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone there…?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Jim, what’re you doing? You’ll
depressurize!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Jim, seal it!</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: No. That was air going into my suit, not
out. Look at your own suits – they’re not rigid anymore. We’ve got
pressure in here.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Above Mars atmospheric? That’s
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We’re millions of miles from Earth and
we’re inside a gigantic white face. What’s impossible?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: There’s six psi in here… Nitrogen and
oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Otherwise known as air?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Hey, there may be some lethal trace gasses I
haven’t picked up yet, or… or… oh, the hell with it.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah. It’s Mars.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Earth, when it was still Pangaea. Before the
continents separated.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: They’re us. We’re them…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We’re Martians…?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That’s what she means.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Almost six hundred million years ago, there
was a sudden expansion of life on Earth. The first multi-celled plants
and animals appeared. No one has ever understood why…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: They seeded Earth.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: …in, please. Can you… me?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Phil, we’re here! We read you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thank God! Listen, this storm is really – –
few more minutes, I can’t – You’ve gotta get back to the ship!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Phil? Phil…?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: We are in a ship. This is a ship. And the
countdown has already started.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Then let’s get the hell out of here!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Jim…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Jim, we gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m not coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: What are you talking about? We’ve got to get
home.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: That’s where I’m going. Don’t you see?
That’s what all this is for. You were right Terri. This is an
invitation. To follow them. To follow them home.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I have to go. This is the mission now. To
find out who we are. Isn’t that why we came here? Like Maggie said, “To
stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one.”</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: You know, when you think about it – I
wasn’t even supposed to be here – all the accidents, everything that got
us to this point, it’s just… it’s just… I just know it’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: I’m okay. I know what I’m doing. But
you’re running out of time. You’ve gotta get back to the ERV and get off
this planet. Now please go.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I once felt like I was taking your turn. But
now I think maybe you’re taking mine. Guess I’m a little jealous.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks for saving my life.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I wish Woody were here to see this. He
would’ve wanted to go too, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: He’s here, Terri. We wouldn’t have made
it without him.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Take care, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey, Jim…?</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Have a great ride.</p>
<p><strong>mcconnell</strong>: Always do.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Phil? Phil, do you read? He’s not reading.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I can barely read you. Let’s get the hell out
of here!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Is anyone there? Can anyone read me?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I’ve lost the Base Camp beacon!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: No good! We’re driving blind.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’ll try to keep on a straight line! It’s our
only chance.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Don’t worry! I’ve worked with Phil for four
years! I know Jim gave him a direct order, but he won’t leave without
us.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is ERV, do you read? ERV to Rover, do you
read…?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is ERV, do you read?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Save the fuel, Phil. We’re coming in.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh, Phil’s not here right now. He left for
Earth five minutes ago. Please leave your message at the beep.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Where’s Jim?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: He got another ride.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Tell you on the way. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Dear God. Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Godspeed Jim McConnell.</p>
