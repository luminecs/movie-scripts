easy job. Man, it’s gonna be hot down in that ditch.</p>

<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Ain’t you never seen a chain gang, in all
your driving around?</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: I ain’t used to hard labor neither. Done my
best to avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: I ain’t crazy about it myself.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Gonna be a hot one to learn on.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Koko, why don’t you let one of these
Newmeats take your broom for today?</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Hell, no. I ain’t goin’ down in the ditch.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: I shore would appreciate it. I ain’t in much
shape just now.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Perhaps if you offered Brother Koko a
small…</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: I ain’t got much. A quarter?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas
War Hero would give you a price.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: I’ll give you fifty cents.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at
least a buck.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: I’ll make it a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Buck is a deal.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: I’ve got this weak heart. Too much drinking,
I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they’ll probably send me
someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: If you even need dough in here, I’m in big
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Where’d you get that about war hero?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Oh we got our sources… Tearing the heads
off… what was it… gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a
grown man?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in
the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: You’ll have to do better than that if
you want to impress these men. Some pretty hard numbers here. Dragline’s
an ex-safe cracker, Koko’s a jewel thief. Blind Dick is a rapist.</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: Show you the clippings some time.
News-Dispatch called me “The Shiek of Simmonsville.” Five broads in
three days…</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: ’Course two of them were sisters.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Of course some of them, like Stupid
Blondie, were just unlucky… he fell off the fire escape… and one or two
don’t really belong here at all… …or myself, who just made the small
error of misspelling a friend’s name… on a check.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Hey, Koko. You hear that? All this time I
been thinkin’ Society just come here for the sun and exercise.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Whatta you so happy about?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I just always did like truck rides.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to
take his broom.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Git your shovel and git to work.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: I don’t think you understand. We made a deal
—</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Git movin’, I said.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: But I made this arrangement –</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Cut that backsass!</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: You’re working too hard. You won’t last
two hours. Watch the way the Human Dragline does it.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Takin’ it off here, Boss!</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Yeah, take it off there.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Takin’ it off here, Boss?</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Yeah, take if off there.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Hey, turn around! Let Koko see the
broad.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Beautiful! A real work of art!</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: Nice broad. Good set.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk
as coots –</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Hey, Tattoo!</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: – went down to see this old hag and she had
needles the size of that cane.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Hey. Swing that yoyo or you gonna get a
taste of that cane.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Man bearcaught, boss!</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: Blondie… Sleepy! Git him afore he
falls.</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: Awright, let’s eat them beans!</p>
<p><strong>boss kean’s voice</strong>: Hey, you. Bean time!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Cold drink he don’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Bet. Babalugats, bet!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You got to snag it, man. You got to stop
foolin’ around and tear up them weeds.</p>
<p><strong>stupid blondie</strong>: Caught short here, boss!</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: Awright, Blondie. Take it behind that
tree.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Boss Godfrey.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: The walking boss.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Don’t he ever talk?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I believe he just said something.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You owe that fella a cold drink.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow’s Saturday. Another
week almost made.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: I got two years.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Only two? Man, I already done eight.
Nothin’ to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain’t
bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time –</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Oh, man, oh man. Look at that. On the bicycle.
Lookit them shorts. I’m dyin’.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: She looks just like a lil girl I useta
know named Louise Merryweather. Fine lil ol’ girl, always partial to
home-made whiskey. Remember one time down in the cellar, both of us
knee- walkin’ drunk and ah had this lil pint and Louise wanted a poke of
it. So ah said: you wanna poke and I wanna poke, so…</p>
<p><strong>boss higgins</strong>: Awright, you, Gibson, step out. Boss
Paul says you wasn’t happy with your job. Done a lot of complainin’.
Gone give you a chance to think it over.</p>
<p><strong>boss higgins</strong>: Get them clothes off.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Awright, first bell! Let’s hit them bunks!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road
finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Back at it in the mornin’. Just need a little
nap…</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Man, I never thought they’d put him in the box
on his first day.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: It was just supposed to be a joke.
There ain’t no brooms. Whoever heard of a chain gang using brooms?</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: I gotta tell you that I believed it.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: He should have known; it was a gag.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: You can’t switch ’round jobs, anyway. I
figured he knew that.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: You can’t expect him to learn
everything the first day. Hopefully it’s taught him a very valuable
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, you fixed it up so he’s got all night to
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: It’s not our fault he’s a
square.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Course not. He ain’t in the box ’cause a
the joke played on him. He’s there ’cause he back sassed a Free Man.
They got their rules and we ain’t got nothing to do with that. Woulda
probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He’s
gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help
they can get.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You tryin’ to say somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You jus’ keep flapping your mouth and one
of these times, you and me gonna raise a little dust.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Awright, last bell!</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss!</p>
<p><strong>wicker man’s voice</strong>: Forty-nine and one in the box.
Right, Carr.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Slow down, man. They ain’t passing out
medals for slinging dirt.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I thought you knew, boy… they sentenced me by
the mile.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Puttin’ ’em on here, Boss!</p>
<p><strong>boss kean’s voice</strong>: Yeah, put ’em on, Drag!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Lookit that. Some Hollywood movie star jus’
joined up with us.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Man, this here Newmeat parking meter
bandit thing what calls itself Luke don’t know nuthin’ ‘bout
nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: But damn if he don’t look like a fat old
Dragline.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Coulda fooled me.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: These is my eyeballin’ glasses. Now I’m
gonna play peek-a-boo and ol’ Godfrey ain’t gonna know if I’m eyeballin’
or tootin’ the piccolo.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: That ain’t nuthing compared to what we used
to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign…</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired
lady.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Man, see her legs. She’s tanned all over.</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: Nice broad. Nice set.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a
married woman… I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a
hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Drag’s been chain-ganging so long he’s got a
nose like a bloodhound.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Maybe he’s been chain-ganging too long.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Long enough to see redhots come and
redhots go.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?</p>

<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah. Well. Gettin’ up here, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: I allus hoped to see you well fixed and
have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I
don’t know where to put my hands on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs,
Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don’t recognize her
pups no more, so she don’t have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She
just don’t give a damn. They let you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Smokin’ it up here, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What
I done with myself is my problem.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: No it hain’t, Luke. You ain’t alone. Ever
whar you go, I’m with you, and so’s John.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You never thought that’s a heavy load?</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: We allus thought you was strong enough to
carry it. Was we wrong?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No. But things ain’t always like they seem,
Arletta. You know that. A man’s gotta go his own way.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: Well, I don’t know, I just wash my hands of
it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: What are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We call it abuildin’ time, Arletta.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: I ain’t askin’ what you’ll do after you get

<p><strong>luke</strong>: You never wanted to live forever anyways, did
you? It wasn’t such a hell of a life.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old
man, Luke, wasn’t much for stickin’ around, but damn it he made me

<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the
way you talk about him.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: He’d… He’d of… broke you up.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: You think life is some kind of ocean voyage
and you start out with buntin’ and hollerin’ and high hopes, but the
damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Here, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: What went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nothin’. Ever’thing’s cool’s can be.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Tried to live always just as free and
aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain’t that much elbow room.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: You allus had good jobs, and that girl in
Kentucky I taken a shine to her.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: She took off with that convertible feller…</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: Well, why not? Idee of marryin’ got you all
choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin’ the hell
out of all of us.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: I’m leavin’ the place to John.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s good: he earned it.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: Nothin’ to do with it. I ain’t never give
John the kind of feelin’ I give you, so I’m payin’ him off now. Don’t
feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a
feelin’ for a child or you don’t, and with John I just didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Gotta go, Arletta.</p>
<p><strong>arletta</strong>: Laugh it up, kid. You’ll make out.</p>
<p><strong>john-boy</strong>: Why can’t you have chains?</p>
<p><strong>john-boy</strong>: Uncle Luke?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: John-Boy looks to you. You’re a hero. He’s
braggin’ on you all over the county.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You must’ve really flung a binge this time.
You really hit that cop?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Much as I’d like to oblige you, John, I didn’t
hit the cop. She’s in pretty bad pain, ain’t she?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fulla dope, Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Keep it with her all the time. Let her have
all she wants.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You don’t want to admire them chains,
John-Boy. They ain’t medals. You get them put on for makin’ mistakes.
And if you make a really bad mistake, then you got to deal with the Man…
and he is one tough old boy.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: So long, Arletta. Take care.</p>
<p><strong>arletta’s voice</strong>: You know it, kid.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now there’s nothin’ for you to come back
for.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: I guess they have to close those things, or
we’d drown. But it’s really suffocating.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Talk about drownin’, I did some trainin’ on
a submarine once. Boy, when you’re under there you really feel it.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Shut up, man. It’s too hot to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You see mah skinny lid boy at chow
tonight. He was matching you plate for plate.</p>
<p><strong>dynamite</strong>: I wasn’t feelin’ good. Think I got a ulcer
or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: He had a spoon like yours, he’d make you
look like a possum on a tree bark.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Oh, come on, Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: What do you mean, Clarence? You callin’ me
a liar?</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Not a liar. You just have a common –
and likable – tendency toward exaggeration.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: He’s the champeen hog-gut of this camp.
Hell, I seen him eat ten choc’lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen
minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If
you’d so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he’d even
eat that.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I can eat fifty eggs.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: You just said he could eat
anything.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You ever eat fifty eggs?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nobody ever ate fifty eggs.</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Bet! Bet! Babalugats!</p>

<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Let’s talk money.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Awright, twenty bucks. Anything! The
Syndicate’ll cover any money you got. Koko, get paper.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Dragline… fifty eggs got to weigh a good six
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>dynamite</strong>: Man’s gut can’t hold that. They’ll swell
up and bust him open.</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: You’re gonna kill him.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Getcha money, up. Gambler! Dynamite!
Everybody. Kokonut Head here is taking the money. Loudmouth – get it

<p><strong>gambler</strong>: How’s he gonna eat ’em?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Boiled for fifteen minutes. Then peeled. I eat
all fifty in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Koko, write down their names, don’t just
make marks.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: One rule! No throwing up. He throws up,
you forfeit everything.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your
mouth and put up your money!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Why’d you have to say fifty? Why not
thirty-five or thirty-nine?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Fifty’s a nice round number.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Damn, Luke. What’s the matter with you?
what’s the matter with me?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nothin’ to worry about. We got a deadlock on
that mullet.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I
loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this
lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned
bread.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We got it locked in the sock.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first
is stretch that l’il ol’ belly of yours – git it all strained out, in
fightin’ shape, like a barrage balloon.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You ol’ sack of guts. I had a belly like
yours, we wouldn’t have nothin’ to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: ’Atsa sign I got me an affectionate
nature.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Like an elephant.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in
makin’ love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it
an’ man – stand back!</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: Lookit this hot gut, Boss. Here’s a man gone
bust the State feedin’ his face.</p>
<p><strong>boss higgins</strong>: Wisht I could eat like that.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thing about bad food, you got to eat a lot of

<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Boss! Man needs a brown bomber and a dose
of salts.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Rules Committee! Rules Committee!</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: Nobody said nothin’ about that!</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Same as dopin’ a race horse!</p>
<p><strong>sleepy</strong>: It don’t sound right.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You jes’ watch us!</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: Fair’s fair.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Got a right to start with a clear gut!</p>
<p><strong>dynamite</strong>: Man can’t eat that much no matter –</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: You can’t just change the rules any
way you want!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Take it easy now, Jabo. Them is eggs, not
them cathead biscuits.</p>
<p><strong>jabo</strong>: I know what eggs look like. I ain’t seen any
around here for three years, but I remember.</p>
<p><strong>rabbit</strong>: I’ve got it figured. If he eats an egg a
minute, he’s got 10 minutes left to swaller them.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I just got sent five bucks from the rodeo
company.</p>
<p><strong>rabbit</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: A bull I fell off.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Awright! Stand back, you pedestrians, this
ain’t no automobile accident!</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: You’re peeling his eggs!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: That’s right, Mister Alibi.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: He peels the eggs himself. That’s
understood.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You jus’ may be great at hangin’ paper
around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless.
When it comes to the law, nothin’ is understood.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Who made what law about peeling his
eggs?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: I’m his trainer, I’m the syndicate what’s
coverin’ all bets, and I’m his official egg peeler.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Just wait till the hour starts, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: One, two, three…</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: He’s gonna lose a finger eating eggs like

<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Oh you gonna come crawlin’ around beggin’
for a cold drink, Drag. Your boy is done for!</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: If I give you a dollar and he don’t eat
all fifty eggs, I get two dollars?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Mechanic!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You’re a sweet old boy and I don’t like to
see you pick up no bad habits. Better use that dollar to buy yourself a
new spark plug or something. But as long as you done took a stand, why
don’t you put some money where your mouth is? Not no measly buck!</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: All I got is three-seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: It’s a bet! Koko! I gone this far, I’m
backin’ mah boy all the way! Come on, who’s next? Where are the big
money men, I want to hear from some high rollers.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: I believe you’ve got it all, Dragline.
Every nickel in camp is riding.</p>

<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Carr? Time?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Six minutes to go, Dragline.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Just shakin’ it down, that’s all, settlin’

<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You think so, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Where’s the egg?</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Man looks like a goddamn bus

<p><strong>gambler</strong>: He gets too close to me and I’ll cut his

<p><strong>koko’s voice</strong>: Snake in the grass! Boss!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Pickin’ it up here, Boss!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Don’t forget your walking stick, Boss.</p>

<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Get in here! Ain’t you scared – ain’t you

<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Borrowin’.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in
our Loan Department. Next!</p>
<p><strong>society red’s voice</strong>: I believe I still owe you
thirty. I don’t suppose you’d take a check.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo’s voice</strong>: My Navy disability didn’t come yet.
You know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sure do… that’s why we didn’t bet with the
Navy.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Oh, that’s mah darlin’ Luke. Grins like a

<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Awright, git lined up here.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Luke, fall out.</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: When a man’s mother dies and he
gits to thinkin’ about her funeral and payin’ respects, before he knows
it his mind ain’t right and he’s got rabbit in his blood and runs. We’re
keepin’ you off the road fer awhile.</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: Ah’m jus’ doin’ mah job, Luke. You gotta
appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Boss, when you do somethin’ to me you better

<p><strong>boss paul’s voice</strong>: Awright, let’s move it out!</p>

<p><strong>sleepy</strong>: Same to you.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: Boy, if anyone had told me where I was going
to be spending Independence Day…</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Wanda trembled, faced by this awesome
decision. It was the moment of choice. Could she take the plunge and
wantonly hurl herself into pagan abandon? Or would she remain ever
fettered by the bonds of her puritanical upbringing? Could she take this
chance to experience the sensual thrill of total release and
gratification? Or would she turn her back and retreat into frigid
denial? Desire and fear, temptation and terror, yearning and horror,
warred within her beautiful young body…</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: First bell! Let’s git to bed. You done had
your fun.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: She moved her head another inch while he
reached up and put his left hand on Carol’s cheek as Carol pressed her
lips to… Oh Lord, I can’t read it!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Carr. Lookit this. Oh I don’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: What you got there, Drag? You bought yourself

<p><strong>carr</strong>: Awright, last bell!</p>
<p><strong>wicker man’s voice</strong>: HEY, CARR! WHAT’S THAT

<p><strong>carr</strong>: Somebody’s on the fence, boss!</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Jackson. He cut a hole in the floor, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: He ain’t even got the sense to run from
the road like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: Blue’ll git him, Boss. We’ll git that
bastid, Cool Hand Luke.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Stan’ back, Dogboy. Git the leash

<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: Blue! Come back here! Come back, I said.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: Listen to Blue sing. She’s on to him. She
says: got him.</p>
<p><strong>boss shorty</strong>: Hail, that dog is jus’ runnin’ in

<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Captain says to wait ’til the Patrol gits

<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: She’s on to him. You shoulda waited fer me
to git her out – loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: It ain’t my fault you don’t know how to
handle your dogs.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus’

<p><strong>boss higgins</strong>: I’m beat. This ain’t mah job,

<p><strong>boss shorty</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Here’s the Patrol.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: She’s got him! You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Okay, let’s get started.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: Come on, Rudolph, Austin, you no good buncha
chicken-eaters, we’re lookin’ for a man. We got us a job to do.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Your dogs are crazy.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: He keeps criss-crossin’. He’s smarter’n a
dog. But he ain’t got us boxed yet… Blue’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: Dammit. Blue! Blue!</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: Look, Cap’n. Look what he done to Blue. He’s
dead, Cap’n. Dead! Run hisself plumb to death. That crazy sadis Cool
Hand Luke run her ’til her heart bust.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: He made it.</p>
<p><strong>carr’s voice</strong>: Forty-eight, Boss. One in the box and
one in the bush.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Awright, hold it!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You gonna get used to wearing them chains
aftera while, Luke. But don’t you never stop listenin’ to them clinkin’.
That’s gonna remind you of what I been sayin’.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard,
noise, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Don’t you never talk that way to me! You
hear? You hear? Never!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What we got here is a failure to
communicate. Some men you can’t reach, that is they just don’t listen
when you talk reasonable so you get what we had here last week, which is
the way he wants it, well he gets it, and I don’t like it any better
than you men.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Awright, buddy. You be awright. You give
‘em a run for their money. Jus’ take it slow and easy, baby. You gonna
make it fine.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Come on, buddy. Show ’em you’re
awright.</p>
<p><strong>boss kean’s voice</strong>: Awright, let’s eat them
beans.</p>
<p><strong>dogboy</strong>: I knew they’d git you. With them chains an a
bonus of a coupla years, you runnin’ days is over forever. Ah’d like to
see you try to run agin. You gettin’ so you smell so bad, I could track
you myself.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: For a natural born son of a bitch like you,
that oughta be easy.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Jus’ take it slow, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: What happened? How far did you get?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Shut up. Let him eat. Don’t pay them no
mind, boy.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: I gotta know – How… how’d they get you?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Topflight police work.</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Tell us about it.</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: You steal a car?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in
the ignition.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Well, how far didya get?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Fat mile’n a half. Hit this red light, highway
patrol pulls up alongside.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Didya fight it out with him?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nope. I jus’ kept lookin’ straight ahead
waiting for that light to change. And he kept lookin’ over, wondering
what somethin’ that looked like me was doin’ drivin’ a shiny new
car.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: And then…?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Then he leans over and sees this state issue…
All there was to it. Feller’s probably a lieutenant by now.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Well now we jus’ gonna lay low and build
time and afore you know it the heat’ll be off you and things be back
where they was. Right, sweet buddy?</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: Ah hears tell you don’t believe in no
God, Luke. Ah was wonderin’ how come a nice lookin’ feller like you come
to get put on the Hard Road. But now ah reckons ah knows. Ah been on the
Road Gang for twenny-two year, Luke, and in all that time I ain’t never
killed no white man but I ain’t afeerd to cause a body has to do his
work. And I ain’t never seen no man that wasn’t afeerd to die
neither.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: ’Scuse me, Boss. Don’t mean to interrupt… but…
caught short here.</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: Awright, Luke. Thas okay… You go on up
there in them trees. Man’s gotta have some privacy sometime. But you
grab a bush and keep shakin’ it, hear? Jes’ so we know you’re there.
Jes’ keep shakin’ that bush.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yes, boss.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m shakin’ it, Boss. I’m shakin’ it!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Still shakin’ it, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>boss kean</strong>: He’s gone! Git the dogs!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Whattaya got them on for?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How do you take your pants off?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well – the best way is to take the leg irons
off first. But you ain’t strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Strong enough for whut?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You couldn’t heft an axe.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Can, too.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ben. Had’n you better take them stripes off
your pants?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You wanna see somethin’ funny? Go get some
chili powder, pepper, curry, dried mustard and like that. A lot of
it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No, me, me. Let me do it!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Here’s them spices. What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You remember how them dogs do when they get
here so you can tell me about it someday.</p>
<p><strong>dragline’s voice</strong>: Thas the church. After he chopped
off those old chains and whilst he was layin’d down the pepper –</p>
<p><strong>gambler’s voice</strong>: I heard it was curry powder.</p>
<p><strong>dragline’s voice</strong>: It was pepper and curry powder and
dry mustard. Now shut your face. Whilst he was layin’ down them spices,
Luke heard them choir practicin’ in there. So he just sauntered inside,
cool’s kin be, and sung along with them… my baby Luke… and he was still
singin’ when the dogs come by, singing and grinning and eatin’ the food
the people had brung him.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul’s voice</strong>: Awright, let’s git to work.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: He ain’t eating beans fer lunch.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: He’s eatin’ steak and corn with butter and
green beans and…</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: …fried clams, pizza, chocolate,
malted milkshakes.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: …and a Brown Bomber.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Shut your mouth. He’s out there doin’ it
for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>carr</strong>: Magazines for you, Dragline!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Magazines? Who’s sendin’ me magazines?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: From mah uncle? Ah never heard from him in
eight years and now he’s sendin’ me magazines. He musta gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Looka that! Two of them. Oh my…</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: I’m dyin’. I’m dyin’.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: What’s the writing say?</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you

<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Oh my. Oh my… Give it back here!</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Lemme see it!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Get away!</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Lookit the brunette…</p>

<p><strong>gambler</strong>: Some legs.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: They must be six feet tall.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: …And the champagne.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Domestic.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Wonder how he got the dough.</p>
<p><strong>alibi</strong>: He’s probably a salesman. You can make pretty
good money if you know what your doing in selling.</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: He’s probably a gigolo.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Or a con artist.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: The head of the rackets.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Oh lookit that brunette.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Mah baby! We’re diggin’ and dyin’ but our
boy Luke is lovin’ and flyin’.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: How about you tryin’ to make me?</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Oh for…</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Dragline, lemme look at the picture.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Yeah, Drag. Get it out for a
look.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You’re just a kid. Whatta you know about
it? You don’t wanna see that dirty picture. Luke and those broads an’
all that booze.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: It’d go to your coconut head. You’d start
getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: Dragline! Be a buddy!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: How much you figure it’s worth, a peek at
this here picture? A quick look, I’m not talkin’ about no memorizin’
job.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: A cold drink.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To
feast yore starvin’ fishy l’il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of
Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a-
friskin’ round with mah boy?</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: A cold drink? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Well — okay. It’s a deal. One cold drink,
if’n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot
l’il hand… That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You run one time, you got yourself a set of
chains. You run twice, you got two sets. You ain’t gonna need no third
set because you’re gonna get your mind right… And I mean right.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Take a good look at your Cool Hand
Luke.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Oh mah poor baby. They done you real good…
I don’t know if you gonna have them gals chasin’ after you for a
while…</p>
<p><strong>society red’s voice</strong>: I’ve got some aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>koko’s voice</strong>: They half killed him.</p>
<p><strong>alibi’s voice</strong>: He should have a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dragline’s voice</strong>: Don’t you never learn nuthin’?
They ain’t gonna let no doctor see what they dont to him…</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Carr, kin we use your razor to clean up
where they cut his head?</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: How you feelin’, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: He don’t hear.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: Somebody get him something to drink.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: That’s my baby.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: He’s gonna be awright.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Luke?… We got the picture! See?</p>
<p><strong>blind dick’s voice</strong>: A pair of beauties. Best I ever

<p><strong>tattoo’s voice</strong>: You really know how to pick ’em.</p>
<p><strong>loudmouth steve’s voice</strong>: Tell us about ’em. What

<p><strong>luke</strong>: Picture’s a phoney… Cost me a week’s pay.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?</p>
<p><strong>gambler</strong>: We saw the broads.</p>
<p><strong>blind dick</strong>: Yeah. Did you have them both at once or

<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s a phoney. Made it up just for you

<p><strong>loudmouth steve</strong>: Aw, come on. We saw it all.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo</strong>: The champagne.</p>
<p><strong>tramp</strong>: Some life.</p>
<p><strong>fixer</strong>: You really had it made.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nothin. I had nothin, made nothin. Couple
towns, couple bosses. Laughed out loud one day and got turned in.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: But – but –</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’s all there was. Listen. Open your eyes.
Stop beatin’ it. And stop feedin’ off me. Now get out of the way. Give
me some air.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: He ain’t himself. He’s all beat up. Cain’t
you see that? He don’t know what he sayin’.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: You was eyeballin’, Luke. You can’t
gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin’…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Boss, you don’t need reasons to hit me.</p>
<p><strong>boss paul</strong>: Gonna learn you not to back sass!</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: He’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: He doesn’t know when to give in.
They’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Give in? That’s our Luke out there.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: That ole box collapse and fall apart
before Luke calls quits.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: Your Luke’s got more guts than
brains.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: I don’t see no sign of guts in you.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: No. No chains either.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: You ain’t man enough to wear them!</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: But you’re dog enough. Maybe they’ll
let you sleep outside the box near your master.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can
write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin’ open a piggy
bank.</p>
<p><strong>society red</strong>: You’ve been having bad luck with
masters, haven’t you? Your last one left you when the cops came… and now
Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.</p>
<p><strong>koko</strong>: You phony creep!</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Awright, that’s enough. You wanna end up

<p><strong>dragline</strong>: You made the week, boy. Plenty of time to

I’ll do anythin’ you say but just don’t hit me! Oh Luke. You are an

<p><strong>luke</strong>: Foolin’, Hell! I would have eaten that dirt

<p><strong>dragline</strong>: And all the time you was plannin’ on

You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: But, Luke…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Take it easy, Drag.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Luke. Where you goin?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: On my own.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: But what am I gonna do all by myself? Oh
if’n I hadn’t lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I
saw you tearin’ down with that truck… But you right Luke. We oughta
split up. Be safer for us both.</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Luke? Just the same, you’re a good old
boy, Luke. You take care, hear?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey, Old Man! You home tonight?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: If you kin spare a minute, it’s about time we
had ourselves a little talk.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Old Man, I know I’m a pretty evil feller who
killed people in the war and got drunk and chopped up municipal
merchandise and like that. I admit ain’t got no call to ask for much.
But even so, you ain’t dealt me no cards in a long time. I mean it’s
beginning to look like you got it fixed so I can’t never win out. Inside
or out, it’s just different bosses and different rules. Where am I
supposed to fit in? Old Man, I got to tell you: I started out pretty
strong and fast but it’s starting to get to me… When does it end?… What
you got in mind for me next? Old Man. What do I do now? Awright. On my
hands and knees a skin’. Yeah. That’s what I thought. I guess I’m just a
hardcase and I gotta find my way out myself.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Is that your answer, Old Man? You’re a
hardcase too, ain’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Luke, are you alright?… They got us, boy.
They’re out there thicker’n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more
guns than I ever seen in my life. We don’t have a chance, Luke… They
caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin’ to kill
you, Luke. But I got ’em to promise if you give up peaceful, they
wouldn’t even whip you this time.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Do we even get our same bunks back?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn’t talk to
them about that. But why not? They’re reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only
been gone a coupla hours.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You don’t understand a thing, do you,
Drag?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got
to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Like I always do?</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Thass right. Just play it…</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Luke, what are do doin’?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: WHAT WE GOT HERE IS A FAILURE TO
COMMUNICATE…</p>
<p><strong>dragline</strong>: Luke!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You follow me and I’ll radio the emergency
clinic to open up…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I’m takin’ him to the prison hospital.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: But that’s an hour away. He ain’t gonna
last twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Git outa the way. He’s ours.</p>
