<p><strong>wife</strong>: Where’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I only called her ten minutes ago –</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I made our reservation for 8:15. We’re going
to be late.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Here she is now.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Dr. Minakis?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mandrakis. It’s okay. Everyone gets it wrong
the first time. You’re Jill? Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I’ve written the number of the restaurant on
the notepad by the phone. Zip me up, will you please? If we aren’t home
in two hours, it means we’ve decided to go on to a movie and won’t be
back until after midnight. Is that all right?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’ve told my service to pick up any calls
coming in to my office phone.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: The children are asleep upstairs – first door
on your left at the top of the landing. They’re both just getting over a
cold – so try not to wake them.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Do you have any questions?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: We have to go now. We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Make yourself at home. The refrigerator’s
loaded.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We even have some low-fat yogurt.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Will you please come on!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hello, Jill? How’s it going? I got it, Dad!
Father! Jesus Christ! My father’s in one of his moods again. Male
menopause, you know. So how are you?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Are you over at Dr. Mandrakis’?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yeah, I’ve been here for about an hour
already.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Isn’t it a neat house?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I guess… I haven’t looked around very
much.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Did you see his kids?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No, they were asleep when I got here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: They’re really cute. So what can I do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You didn’t happen to talk to Billy today, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah, I talked to him.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Did he say anything about me?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t know what you did to him, or said to
him, or what… but he’s really pissed off at you! What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It’s what I didn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah, I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Do me a favor, Nance.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Do you think you’ll be talking with Billy some
time tonight?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Prabably. I’m going to the library in a few
minutes. I just have to get out of this house! Hey! Why don’t Billy and
I come over there? He’ll come along if I tell him to.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That isn’t what I had in mind.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You’ll be safe with Billy. I’ll be there.
Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Nancy, all you want to do is come over here
and get drunk.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who? Me?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who? Me?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You want to see Billy, don’t you?!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’ve got a lot of work to do. I don’t want you
coming over!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You know what your problem is, Jill, is
you’re so straight. I really mean that. You go to a private school, you
wear a bra. No one can have a good time with you! You know, Billy asked
me to go out with him this weekend, and I was really really tempted
because I like Billy… a lot… as much as you do. But I told him I
couldn’t, that I didn’t think it was right because you were my friend
–</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You are my friend.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah. I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Listen, just give Billy the number here, but
don’t tell him I told you to. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay. I’ve got to go now.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Billy?…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Have you checked the children?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Have you checked the children?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Mrs. Mandrakis?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Have you checked the children?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Billy! I don’t think this is very funny!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: …Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Golden Bull…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello, I’d like to speak to Dr. Mandrakis.
This is his babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Hold on a minute.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant about
forty minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Forty minutes?</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Operator…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello, Operator? Can you get me the
police?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Is this an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes! No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: The number is 555-9431. Would you like me
to connect you?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello, I’ve been getting phone calls, every
fifteen minutes or so. I think it’s a man. He’s trying to scare me.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: An anonymous caller?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Has he threatened you?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Has he been using obscene language?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No. He just keeps calling me. Sometimes he
doesn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: There’s really nothing we can do about it
down here. Is the phone listed in your name?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No, I’m just the babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: It’s probably just some weirdo. The city’s
full of them. Believe it or not, we get reports like this every night.
It’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Have you tried whistling?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: If you can find a good loud whistle
somewhere in the house, blow it into the phone hard, next time he calls.
Probably break his eardrum. He won’t bother you after that.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No, I… You’re probably right. It’s nothing to
worry about.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Or you could just take your phone off the
hook.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No, the people I’m babysitting for might try
to reach me.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Well, as I say, there’s nothing we can
really do to help you down here.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: You bet. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Why haven’t you checked the children?</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I called you before… about the man who keeps
calling me?</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: He called me again.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Did you try whistling?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No, he’s out there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Out where?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: In the neighborhood. He’s been watching me…
through the windows.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No. I know he’s there.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Is the house locked up?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: And the windows?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Then you’re safe. If he wanted to break in,
he wouldn’t be calling you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Please, can’t you help me? I’m all alone.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Tell you what. If this guy calls you again
–</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: He will call again! I know he will!</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Okay, calm down now. I can alert the phone
company so that if he calls again we can try to trace the call. What’s
your number there?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: 555-0672.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: And the address?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: 3317 Oakridge Drive.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Oh, yeah, I know where that is. All right.
If the guy calls again, try to keep him on the line for at least a
minute so we can trace the call.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: But he never stays on that long! Sometimes he
hangs up after just a couple of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: It’s the only way we can help you. By the
way, what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Jill Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Jill, the important thing is to relax.
You’re safe where you are. We’ve got patrolmen cruising the area all
night long. Just stay calm. Will you do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: In the meantime, we’ll be watching your
line. Okay, Jill?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Call again if there’s any problem.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I know. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I won’t be here much longer. The doctor and
his wife are coming home soon.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Can you see me?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’m sorry I turned the lights down. It didn’t
work anyway. I can turn them back up if you like –</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Don’t? You’ve really scared me. Is that what
you wanted? Is that what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Your blood… all over me.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You don’t know me. You don’t know who I am or
where I live. I’ll get Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him or the
police.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: You’ve called the police?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>sacker</strong>: Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker! Listen to me!
We’ve traced the call. It’s coming from within the house. A squad car’s
on its way over there now… just get out of that house!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Are the parents here yet?</p>
<p><strong>cop’s voice</strong>: Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Christ! What a homecoming!</p>
<p><strong>cop’s voice</strong>: They wanted to talk to someone. I asked
them to wait until you got here. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: We were only a block away when the call went
out. When we got here, the guy was still waiting upstairs in the
children’s bedroom. He was covered with blood.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Blood?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Not his own. The children had been dead for
several hours.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: He’d been using an old phone in their
bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: We found a Merchant Seaman’s card on him.
He’s English. Entered the country less than a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: How about the babysitter?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: She’s going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>master</strong>: So you’re in business for yourself now.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Yes, sir, for the past three and a half
years.</p>
<p><strong>master</strong>: That’s good. And you’d heard about Curt
Duncan’s escape?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>master</strong>: Do you think the police will… find him?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I know they haven’t assigned anyone to it
specifically. It’s an old case.</p>
<p><strong>master</strong>: An old case. Can you find him?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this
week, but I’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>master</strong>: He could be anywhere by now.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I don’t think so… because he’s a
foreigner. He’ll come back to the city. After six years in confinement,
it’s the only place that’s familiar to him. That’s important.</p>
<p><strong>master</strong>: A man murders two children in cold blood. A
jury declares him insane. How could such a person not be?</p>
<p><strong>master</strong>: He is sent to a state mental institution
where the security is… less than perfect. And he escapes. It… it isn’t
fair.</p>
<p><strong>mandrakis</strong>: A thing like that should never be allowed
to happen again.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I couldn’t agree with you more.</p>
<p><strong>mandrakis</strong>: Go ahead then. My accountant will contact
you.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Thank you. How is Mrs. Mandrakis?</p>
<p><strong>mandrakis</strong>: She is… unable to have any more
children.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’m sorry. Please give her my best.</p>
<p><strong>mandrakis</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Curt Duncan isn’t going to run right
out and kill more children. I’m not worried about that.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: We had him for six years… under
continuous therapy, some of it rather forceful…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: …and drugs… tranquilizers depressants,
lithium…</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Eventually, anyone will respond to the
treatment here.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: You gave him electric shock?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Yeah, we zapped him a few times. It’s
fairly standard.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: It says here thirty-eight… thirty- eight
times.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: What will happen to him now, without the
drugs he was on?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: There’ll be some deterioration. That’s
inevitable, but we can’t say how much.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: During the time that you had him here, did
you discover any particular habits of his, peculiarities, quirks,
anything that might help me find him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: It’s all in the folder.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Any letters from people back in England?
Family?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: That, too, is in the folder.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Let’s get something straight here, Doctor.
I’ve been 33 years in the business of tracking people down and putting
them away. I spent almost a year on Curt Duncan alone, with the trial,
the testimonies, the background investigations. I didn’t come here today
to look in your goddamn folders. In fact, I wouldn’t have come here at
all if you’d done your job right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital, not a
penitentiary. Everything that pertains to one of our patients is
meticulously recorded in that patient’s folder… whether you can make
sense of it or not.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-
schizophrenic. They see themselves as victims, and they always blame
other people for the way they are. When Duncan killed the Mandrakis
kids, it wasn’t an act of hostility against the children but against
their parents. He was getting back at his own parents for traumas he
suffered in early childhood. The criminal side of Curt Duncan is one of
terrible, symbolic vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Assuming he isn’t found right away… what
will happen to him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: I think you’ll find him. Somebody will
find him. He can’t function out there. He’ll make a mistake. This is
where he belongs. After six years in here, he’s suddenly gone out to
confront the world again. I think he’s in for a bit of a shock.</p>
<p><strong>retired man</strong>: Rackin’ ’em up today, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Doin’ all right.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: C’mon in and shut the door.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: What’ll it be? Hey! What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: What kind of clothes was he wearing… when
he escaped?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Ordinary street clothes. Not all of our
patients have to wear the green Gucci gowns.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Did he have any money with him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Probably. But not more than, say, fifty
dollars. Some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward, for
which they are paid. It’s part of the rehabilitation.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: What’s Guy du Mar–</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Guy du Marraux syndrom.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: It’s a psycho-motor dysfunction.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Duncan had it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Only from time to time, which is
unusual.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: It attacks the nervous system. People
suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities,
sometimes one, sometimes a whole string of them. They can’t control
it.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Are you being serious?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Yeah. Here, I’ll give you an example.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Duncan never had the twitch that sometimes
goes with it. And with Duncan, as I said, the disease would only
manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety. When he was really
flipping out, in other words.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Duncan was Catholic?</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Yeah. So am I.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: That makes three of us.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Is that right? So we all share the same
guilt.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: Here. This is Curt Duncan shortly after he
was admitted here in 1972.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: – to put the situation right. The
hypodermic needles are only used to give you medication that will calm
you down. They make you feel good, relaxed. All right? We’re not putting
anything in your food either. The food is just food.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: No. I don’t eat the food. It doesn’t taste
right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. monk</strong>: That’s Duncan.</p>

you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: After what I been through, I don’t mind
anything.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: See, that’s the whole point. My mind… Your
mind… Where do they fit in? You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Do you live around here?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Get offa me!!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Listen, I didn’t mean nothin’. I don’t live
around here. See – ?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I think the lady wants to be left alone.</p>

<p><strong>bill</strong>: I think you’d better just move along, pal.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: He’ll be okay now, Bill. He just –</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No! I want him out of here!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Go on, beat it.</p>

<p><strong>man</strong>: Donna. Donna! Hey! What the hell – !</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: What is all this?!</p>
<p><strong>scattered voices</strong>: Happy birthday, Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Look at him!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Don’t shoot us, Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: How was I supposed to know?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Will you tell me what this is about,
Cliff?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Yeah, in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: I don’t think I can take any more of these
surprises.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Okay now, what’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Stand still. I want you to remember this
in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: If you want me to remember something in the
morning, then tell it to me in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Charlie, come on.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: All right, all right. What is it? You’re
getting married.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: No. I got a job today, tracking
someone.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: That’s great, Cliff; I’m sure you’ll find
your man.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: It’s Curt Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: You didn’t know he got out?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I need your cooperation on this one.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Sure. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Oh, it’s you! What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: …Came to apologize. I…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Look, I’m the one who should be sorry. I
didn’t want that to happen. Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all right.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m new in town. Don’t know anybody…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Where’re you from?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: New York. Ever been there?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Sure. Sure I’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone cold,
unfriendly…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hello?…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: …No, I just got in… I don’t know if I can…
Listen, I can’t talk now. Can I call you back?… Okay… Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’m not from New York, actually. But I’m
very, very far from home.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Look, you can’t come in here.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I thought we might get some coffee. Can I
buy you – ?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Someplace nearby?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Not tonight. You’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I got no place to go.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: You can’t –</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Just, just a little coffee?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Okay, tomorrow. When?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I said maybe. I don’t know. Listen, I’m sorry
about this afternoon. I really am. All right? That was my boyfriend on
the phone. He’s coming over. So please leave. Now.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I like you.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Look, do you want me to call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It’s okay. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I’ll see you later… sometime. I still want
to buy you that drink.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Jesus, I don’t recognize anybody.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Three years is a long time in a place like
this.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Three and a half.</p>
<p><strong>wc</strong>: Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: How long will you be here?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Depends on how lucky I get. I’ll only be
coming around once, maybe twice a week.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You want to use your old desk? Someplace to
sit down?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Is it vacant?</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: Okay, man, move it out. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Wha – ?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: There’s another one down there.</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake
– Jesus Christ! What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: You get hit by a truck or what?</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: I’m sorry, man, but you can’t stay
in here. Go out to the park, lay in the sunshine. You’ll feel better.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: God bless it! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>maintenance man</strong>: Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: All right! All right!</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Whaddya say, pardner. I’m dry as a bone.
You got any money?</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: You neither, huh? My name is Morgan, but it
ain’t J.P. Guess I better go to work. Take ’er easy now, pardner.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: My name’s John Clifford. I’m a private
investigator.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: A private detective.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: What do you want with me?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’d just like to talk, ask a few
questions.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’ve got nothing to say about anything or
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Listen, lady, I can be back in thirty
minutes with a search warrant and a handful of cops, and I can probably
have you arrested, whether or not the charges would stick. Now do you
want to let me in and talk?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Have you got a badge?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’ll show you a badge when you open the
goddamn door!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I don’t carry a badge. I’m issued a
license, a piece of paper, and I left it at home. You’re Tracy
Fuller?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Can we sit down?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Do you recognize this man?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: He’s escaped from the insane asylum. In
1972, he murdered two children… broke into a house and found them asleep
in bed. It was a little boy, five an a half, and a little three-
year-old girl. After the coroner’s investigation, their bodies were
taken to the mortuary, where the undertaker took one look at them and
said he couldn’t have their bodies reconstructed for the funeral without
six days of steady work. Then he asked what had been the murder weapon,
because looking at the mess in front of him, he couldn’t imagine what
had been used. The coroner told him there had been no murder weapon. The
killer had used only his hands. The undertaker went to work and had them
done in four.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: He’s been here.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Do you think he’ll try to see you
again?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I don’t know. He said he had no place else to
go.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Let’s play it safe. Let’s assume that he
will.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Will you work with me?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: You again?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: What are your hours tonight?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: No hours. Bar’s closed on Mondays.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I want you to be open if that’s
possible.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: No way. Monday’s my night off. Come back
tomorr…</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: This is tomorrow! Now what are your
hours?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’ve come to say goodbye, and thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You found him?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: From here on, I go it alone.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: What’s the point of chancing it, Cliff?
We’ll let you take the credit.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’m going to kill him, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: The closer I get to this guy, the more I…
It gets to me. I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: I think you’d better go on home, Cliff.
You’ve fallen in.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: No. Not this time. This is the case that
makes up for a whole career. If you can’t understand it now, you will in
a few years.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: What part does money play in all this? Play
straight with me.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: For what I’m being paid, it’s not out of
line.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Who’s hired you for this?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: So you’re a hitman now.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: He murdered two kids in cold blood. You
were there, too.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You could get busted.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I understand that.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: What are you going to use?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Jimmy needles.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You’re stretching our friendship, Cliff. If
you blow this at all –</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: You’ll never hear from me again.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Take your time. Do it right.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Do you need any help preparing for this
thing?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’m ready. I’m just trying to think where
he could be in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Coffee.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You get mugged?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Black.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Coffee’s twenty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Coffee’s twenty-seven cents. Ya got it or
don’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Okay, buster, one cup. On the house.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Drink it and be on your way.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Well! I can’t say much for your protocol,
but your timing’s dead on. Here’s to you, pardner.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’m looking for an old buddy of mine,
English fella. Name’s Crazy Curt. Any of you guys seen him?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I owe him some money.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Aaahh. Show me an honest man…</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Stands about so. Brown hair. Face kind of
banged up. Was in an accident.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy, not
more’n an hour ago. Looked bad. Crazy Curt, huh?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Hell, I can’t remember. Prob’bly see him
again though. Tell you what. You leave the money with me, I’ll see he
gets it… as a favor to you.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I have to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Whatsa matter? You don’t trust me? I’ll
have you know I used to be a college professor. We can work
together.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Sure. Keep the bottle. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: “Long life to the grape! For when summer is
flown, The age of our nectar Shall gladden our own.” That’s Shelley, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Hey, Hank, what’re you doing open
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Trying to make a buck.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Keep it, honey. My treat.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: That how you make a buck?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: No luck. You see him?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: He still could be out there, though.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’m going to hang around outside for
awhile. I’ll be back on and off again all night.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Are you sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: All right. Bolt your door. Don’t let
anybody in, no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’ll be seeing you. Listen. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: I just have to talk to you. I want you to be
my friend.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>seaman</strong>: So this will be your first time? An old salt
like you?</p>
<p><strong>seaman</strong>: You’ll love it here. It’s where they make
the bombs. It’s where they make the planes that carry the bombs; the
planes we saw over Singapore and Manila.</p>
<p><strong>seaman</strong>: There she is. That’s America.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Save it for later. Let’s go out and get some
food.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What about the lad? You can’t leave him.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Curt’s asleep. He’ll never know we’re
gone.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Hey, Crazy Curt!</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: Hail fellow well met, and all that jazz.
It’s our lucky day! A friend of your’s got money for you. We got to get
back to the park and meet him.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: C’mon. He’ll be comin’ for you, Crazy Curt.
S’got some money. We’ll get us a little joy juice.</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: C’mon! Hey!! You really are crazy!
C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>cheater</strong>: “Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage!
Blow, you cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drench’d our
steeples and drown’d the cocks!”</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Duncan. Duncan. It’s over now. Come on
out.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: My name’s John Clifford. I’m a private
detective. I’ve been hired by Alexander Mandrakis to take you back. I’m
not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you… I’m not going
to hurt you… There’ll be no more pain… You’re safe now…</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: No! Mandrakis! No!</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I used to see my two kids every weekend. They
lived in a nice house with their father, outside the city.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Now… it’s been years. They’re grown up.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I look at where I am now. I know I could’ve
done better, but… it’s too late for that.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Well, you’ve got to keep looking, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I don’t think he’ll come back here.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Thanks… for all your help.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I know it wasn’t easy. Maybe, someday,
I’ll be able to…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t leave me altogether…</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’m not a young woman anymore. I’ve given up
all my dreams of the future. Now, I just want to make it to the end. You
know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I’ll be around.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: You like ice cream?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Yes.</p>

<p><strong>john</strong>: I thought it was nice.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are the kids asleep?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: They will be soon. Give them about twenty
minutes and then take a peek – but if Stevie sees you, you’ll have to
tell him a story. Here’s the number of the restaurant. Call us if you
need us. For police, ambulance, any emergency like that, just dial 911.
You know that, right?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Nine-one-one? Oh, sure.</p>

<p><strong>jill</strong>: John, I don’t believe it! District Sales
Manager!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Well, it’s about time!</p>

<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Enjoy your dinner, folks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll be the youngest District Manager in the

on over there?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Nothing’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Yes, there’s nothing –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Everything’s fine. Why? What’s –?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Carol, listen to me very carefully. If there’s
a man in the house, if there’s any reason why you can’t talk to me right
now, just answer yes to me over the phone. That’s all. If there’s any
danger of any kind, just say yes.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I don’t understand what’s happening. What man
in the house?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Carol, it’s Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me
truthfully. When was the last time you looked in on the children?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: About forty-five minutes ago. Everything’s
fine. They were fast asleep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Carol, I’m sorry about all the hysterics.
We’re leaving the restaurant now. We’ll explain everything when we get
home. Before we hang up, could you do just one more thing for me,
please?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Would you go upstairs and, and check on the
children for me?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Sure. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: What seems to be the problem here,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Officer, I’m John Lockhart. Just a second
please, and I’ll explain everything.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’m Jill Johnson, the babysitter seven years
ago with the child killer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The babysitter. The guy got into the house and
killed the two children upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Oh, yeah, I remember something about
that. A Greek doctor…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s right. That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: It was in the seventh precinct…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Carol?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Carol? Carol?!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Carol? Carol?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jill!</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Sshhh…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing was wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: When I got back to the phone, the line was
dead. I figured we got cut off somehow. What’s been going on?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If I ever get my hands on the guy that made
that call…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: John, it wasn’t a prank. I know that
voice.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He disguised it though, didn’t he? Same as
before?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I know that voice.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: How can we just sit here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, we promised never to talk about
this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are we supposed to do? Leave town? Take
the kids and lock ourselves up somewhere? Come on… Let’s get a good
night’s sleep, and in the morning we can rethink this whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Nothing has to be rethought. And I’m not about
to fall asleep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Try to relax, honey. I’m here. We’re both
here. The house is locked up. The cops’ll be just outside all night
long. We’re safe now.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: That’s what they told me before.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Look. If it’ll make you feel any
better…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll keep it right here beside me all night.
You know I’m a light sleeper and a damn good shot. Are you
satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: John, I’m sorry to be putting you through all
this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, you’re not putting me through anything
that you don’t have to go through yourself. I’m with you all the way.
Trust me. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now try to relax. We’ll get some sleep. You’ll
be surprised how differently things will look in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Honey…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Not so loud. You’re going to wake the
children.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Naw. Those kids’d sleep through an earthquake.
They’re good kids. Here, take a couple of these. They’re just what the
doctor ordered.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know, I read somewhere about this
psychological thing called hysterical delusion or hysterical recall or
something. It had to do with how an event from your past can sneak up on
you sometimes and fool you when it’s only just a memory. I don’t know.
We’ll talk about it in the morning. Maybe there’s someone we can see
about that…</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: What’s a word for “an outsider, of
sorts”?</p>
<p><strong>policeman #3</strong>: Trespasser.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: Uh-uh. Eight letters.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #3</strong>: Stranger.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: Uh-uh. Starts with an “I”.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Hey, Bert. A report just came in on
that guy, Curt Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Broke outta the nuthouse two months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: Oh, yeah? You going to put that in our
report?</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Diamonds, Charlie. Diamonds was led.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Course I’m going to put it in the
report. Maybe this gal tonight really did get a call from him. Who
knows?</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Your lead, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: What the hell are you doing? That’s a
trump.</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: A card laid is a card played.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: Yeah, you’re right. We’d better leave
that on Ruznik’s desk in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: Toss ’em in. I got the rest.</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Jesus Kay-Reist!</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Hey, Tucker, lemme see that a minute.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You guys have a stake on the house?</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Bernstein and Waller are checkin’ it
every twenty minutes or so.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: Hey, what’s an eight letter word for
“an outsider, of sorts”? Starts with an “I”.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Intruder!</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: Right! Intruder!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Cliff?… I think I got something for you…</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Operator.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Can you dial a local number for me?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: What is the number, please?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: 555-2183.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Operator, what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, that line seems to be
disconnected.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Why don’t I get a recording?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I don’t know, sir. Maybe the number was
just recently disconnected. Maybe there’s a temporary malfunction in the
wiring. Why don’t you try it again in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Yeah, okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Stevie… Stevie…</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Stevie, listen to me. Where did you get this
candy?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: The man gave it to me…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What man?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I don’t know… He was… Wings on a horse…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: John?… John?…</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: John!… John!…</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Your husband’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>june</strong>: Mommy?</p>
