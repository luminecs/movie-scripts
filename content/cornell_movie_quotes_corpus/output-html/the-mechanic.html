<h1 id="the-mechanic">the-mechanic</h1>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Every man has a death that’s right for him.
Every one. REVERSE to find a wall of photographs, charts, official
documents. In the center A PHOTOGRAPH of a man, mid-40’s, East-Indian,
dressed like the billionaire he is. Dodi Fayed meets Bill Gates. THE
MARK.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: For every man, there’s a way to leave this
earth which is so right for them, it’s almost as if they carry it with
them. MOVING over the wall. MORE PHOTOGRAPHS. The Mark escorted from a
bullet-proof sedan by ear-wired men. Entertaining at a palatial estate.
Magazine covers: “The billion-dollar lifestyle.” “The new Playboy.”
…passing over smaller articles: “What does this man do with your
money?”</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: When the right death overtakes a man, there
will be grief in those who knew him, but there will also be a sense of
inevitability. Because they will know, that of course… CLOSE ON BISHOP.
Statue-like, except his eyes which dart across the wall in front of him,
making connections…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …Of course, this was always going to happen
this way. WHOMP! The SOUND OF THE RACE floods in as the cars blow by,
revealing Bishop amidst onlookers, watching, calculating.</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s p.o.v.</strong>: Two cars TANGLE in a corner, SPIN
to a stop, crushing a half-million in beautiful restored antique. The
Mark climbs from his wreck, tosses his helmet, pissed. Bishop raises a
camera, takes a picture.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: ’Evening, Arthur. Got your weekly right
here. The man hoists two bags of groceries onto the counter. Bishop
comes forward, sees the Owner’s DAUGHTER behind the counter. 12,
precocious, reading a dog-eared kid’s book.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Hey, Sophie. I got something for you, wanna
see? The girl smiles, puts down the book and comes over. Bishop crouches
in front of her. He puts out two empty hands, shows them back and front,
then tickles one ear with a hand while the other “appears” a small
daisy. The girl sees it, smiles… a little disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m just kidding. Bishop reaches into his
jacket, pulls out the next installment in the kid’s book she’s reading:
A series featuring a young female Harry-Potter like character on the
cover: LUNA CROMWELL. Sophie BEAMS, takes it. A quick hug and she’s back
to her seat, opening the new book.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: What do you say, honey?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Thank you, Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You’re very welcome. And she’s back into the
book. Bishop smiles, a little sad. It was nice… but the moment’s over.
He stands and collects his groceries.</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: See you next week, Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>male news anchor</strong>: …here’s a guy at the top of his
game. And yes there were questions about the money: Where did it all go.
Were some of his friends less than friendly to the US? But in the end,
it’s not the feds who catch up with him –</p>
<p><strong>female news anchor</strong>: It’s that age old adage that
boys will be boys. These dangerous hobbies come with the risk of
accidents like this – Bishops punches off the tv, heads for the
door.</p>
<p>****: It’s open! Bishop pushes the door open, steps into…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I’ll just be a minute. We catch a
GLIMPSE of the WOMAN. A towel over her hair, wearing a skirt and a bra,
crossing from the bathroom into her bedroom. Even in the small glimpse,
she’s beautiful. Bishop looks down at a coffee table. Magazines,
newspaper. A picture of the first Mark’s elaborate funeral.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry I was away so long this time. I
had some complications… He turns. She’s emerged from the bedroom. 30’s.
Long dark hair, damp from the shower. Buttoning a shirt, the curve of
her breasts caught as she does. A comfortable, sophisticated air about
her. Effortlessly attractive.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You don’t have to apologize. I’m just glad
you’re here now.</p>
<p>****: Are you hungry? She starts to move by him, his hand catches her
arm and she is in his arms, holding him TIGHT, kissing him.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m sorry. I just… miss you. I never thought
I was going to be a “woman who waits.” But I do. I wait for you. He
nods. She breaks off, pours red wine in a glass.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Were you in Europe? Africa?</p>
<p>****: Was there another woman?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Liar. It’s alright. I don’t mind. I… I made
something for you. She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen TV.
Hits a button. A moment, then an IMAGE flickers to life.</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: The WOMAN, sitting in this same living
room. She wears a long sleeve shirt over panties. Sips a glass of wine.
Smiles warm at the camera. The silence of late night.</p>
<p><strong>woman on camera</strong>: Hey, you. Just got back from the
weekend at the lake with Julianne and Barry and their kids. Their oldest
is five. You’d like him.</p>
<p>****: Everybody spoke about you, of course. We should go up there
sometime, just the two of us…</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: She reaches towards the camera and the
image JUMPS AHEAD. Another night, late. The WOMAN enters the frame, now
wearing a stunning black party dress.</p>
<p><strong>woman on camera</strong>: I, just got back from seeing the
most boring opening at the Pierre Grochet gallery. And of course
everyone’s asking where you are and of course I made your apologies, but
what I was thinking…</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: She winks at the camera, happily drunk.
Raises her dress a little, suggestive…</p>
<p>****: Why weren’t you here to take me home and make love to me…? She
blows a kiss. Closes her eyes…</p>
<p><strong>on bishop</strong>: Watching. Emotion breaks the surface. The
WOMAN raises the remote. Turns off the image. Looks at Bishop. Plain,
not demanding. But caring.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m not a man who… It wouldn’t be good for
you, if I was around all the time.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know. I know. She moves to him and they are
kissing fierce.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Stay for breakfast? He turns. She’s
standing in the doorway, tying a robe around herself. A cool
professionalism inhabits her demeanor. Not crass or mean-spirited, but
the romance is gone.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Do I ever?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No. But there’s a first time for everything.
Bishop goes to the DVD player, slots out the DVD they watched the night
before and pockets it.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Thank you. This was a good one. See you next
time.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Bishop… You all right? He turns, studies her.
This is new ground. He nods and leaves. She stares a moment at the door
after he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes, I just got here. No, not yet. He turns,
REACTS as Bishop is there, CLOSE, barely sweating.</p>
<p>****: Hold on, I got him. The man holds his cell phone out for
Bishop. A beat, Bishop studying the angles… he takes the phone.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Arthur? Jesus Christ, Arthur, is that
you?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …How are you, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Oh you know, I’m God Damn perfect. I’m
redecorating my fucking office and I wanted your advice on the god
forsaken curtains is how I am. This is… this is something, Arthur. I
need to see you, for old time’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Sorry, gotta do this… Patient, Bishop puts
his arms out as the man searches him.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I like the new digs. McKenna LAUGHS, like a
grunt. Fiddles with his hearing aid, turning it up. Bishop’s eyes
track.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Has it really been that long? Jesus.</p>
<p>****: You know how they say youth is lost on the young? They’re
right. If I had my nineteen year old body back, I wouldn’t be here, I’ll
tell you that. I’d be out there, making it my personal life mission to
bang every stewardess who ever dared put on one of those whatchamacallit
skirts.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Times have changed, Harry. They don’t wear
skirts anymore. McKenna eyeballs Bishop, shakes his head. He goes to the
glass wall, points out at the screens, financial markets.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You know what all that is? That’s their
money, getting moved, exchanged. Made clean and neat and proper for
Uncle Sam. And I have always been extremely careful.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You know what that is? That’s a God damn
subpoena from the Justice Department. We get a new face in the white
house, all of a sudden they want to look at my records. They got
accountants want to go through MY BOOKS. Are you kidding me? I got the
left hand coming after me for what I did for the right hand. Bishop
looks over the papers, nods.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: So I call them up. I say “hey, you guys
gotta get your own house in order…”</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: And? And that’s the point! Nothing. I tell
them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it I get
silence, zippo, fuck- all. What are they, twelve?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …I don’t see how I can –</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: That’s bullshit, Arthur. Your father – they
still talk about the guy like he walked on water. You, they’ll listen
to. You –</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m not a part of that. McKenna stares out
the window at the street below, nervous. Shakes a pill out of as small
vial, pops it. He chuckles, shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You remember that fishing trip we all took,
back in the day. You were, what? About eight, right? You fell out of the
boat… couldn’t swim a stroke. City kid. You’re in the water, splashing
around.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You got these big eyes like saucers, like
you’re sure you’re gonna drown. Splashing… swallowing water… just
STARING at your father and he’s not making a move. Remember? Just
looking down at you like… Suddenly it’s gotten less funny.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: I finally had to grab you by the hair, pull
you back into the boat. You’re shivering like hell and he – your dad –
gives one of those laughs. Those big laughs everyone loved him for.</p>
<p>****: Anyway, the whole time you’re in the water, you didn’t cry out.
Not once. You were a tough sonofabitch, even then.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That was a long time ago, Harry. McKenna
turns from the window, takes in all his monitors, charts. Stock lines
tick up and down, graphs flow, pulse…</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Well, I’m in the water this time, Arthur.
You think it’s easy for me to ask? It cuts like hell. But that’s what
I’m doing. Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the
office. Pillows and blankets on a sofa. Some clothes strewn about.
McKenna’s been sleeping here. A long beat. Bishop… nods. The tension
seems to DRAIN from McKenna. He claps Bishop on the back, nods back.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: …Thank you. Thank you. THROUGH THE GLASS
WALL OF THE OFFICE. Bishop’s eyes track as elevator doors open and STEVE
MCKENNA steps out, a beautiful young woman with him, LOUISE. She’s a
trophy, the woman you get for being top dog and the one you regret
getting. Gorgeous, self-obsessed, entitled. She flops onto a leather
sofa as Steve moves towards the office. Steve’s young, mid-20’s,
strikingly handsome, wearing the casual uniform of wealth not earned.
But there’s something else that arrests Bishop immediately. Unwasted
motion, detachment, observing the world around him… from above.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: And here’s the prodigal son, arrived to
bilk me for ransom.</p>
<p>****: Steve, this is Arthur Bishop. Steve shakes Bishop’s hand.
Strong. Observant.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey. Nice to meet you. You work for my
father?</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: No, quite the opposite. Arthur’s doing me a
little favor.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So you’re a criminal?</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Relax, relax. I’m kidding. A last beat
between Steve and Bishop, then Steve lets it go, turns his attention to
his father.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I need you to make a donation to Louise’s
charity. She’s mounting some kind of fundraiser and she wants to make
sure we do our part.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: What’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I have no idea. And don’t pretend you care,
either. Write the check, go to the party, smile when the</p>
<p><strong>orphans-slash-homeless-widows thank</strong>: you and call
you a great and generous man.</p>
<p>****: You ever think of having kids, Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Wise man. How much?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thirty thousand. You know, I can’t tell what
you’re thinking, Mr. Bishop. Usually, I’m very good with that, with
people. Sort of like a bullshit detector I developed. But you’re very…
hard to read.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Don’t be. So what are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I was thinking that a son, should be more
grateful to his father.</p>
<p>****: I agree. I agree. I often wonder why I’m not. McKenna tears the
check out, hands it to Steve.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: There. Now go away.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thank you, dad. Are we going to see you at
the house any time soon?</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Yeah, this is just a few more days. We got
this… situation. Steve hears the dark in his father’s tone, tracks
it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You? Yeah, you can earn some money. Get
married.</p>
<p>****: No, it’s going to be okay now. Arthur’s helping me out. Steve
glances between the two men. Ego slightly bruised.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well it’s good to meet you Mr. Bishop. My
father seems to trust you, which is… unusual. Bishop and McKenna watch
as he hits the atrium, hands Louise the check who goes out of her mind,
jumping up and down, giving him a kiss that speaks of more to come,
trotting off. Steve glances back one more time, then follows her.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: We will take from our children for a
lifetime what we would not suffer from another man for an instant.
Explain that to me. Okay. Okay, call me when you hear something.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You take care of yourself, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Well, that’s your job now, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>art dealer</strong>: Arthur. Glad you’re here. Right this
way. As they move across the space Bishop catches sight of a MODEL,
lying nude in a pool of blue paint. Across from her, The ARTIST is
full-focused on her. He’s roughly Bishop’s age. Cigarette dangles off a
lip, tattoos on his arms. Fully comfortable and committed to the
alternative life. The model senses Bishop’s gaze, looks over,
unashamed.</p>
<p><strong>art dealer</strong>: This way. Bishop follows the Dealer into
another area where they approach a canvas. It’s a portrait of a young
boy, alone. The effect is of rage-filled isolation.</p>
<p><strong>art dealer</strong>: Zak is almost finished. It will make a
wonderful addition to your collection. Bishop looks at the canvas. Nods.
Glances back to where the artist is carefully adjusting his model’s
position.</p>
<p><strong>art dealer</strong>: Do you want to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …No.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Bishop. How can I
help you?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes. I’d like to speak to Dean. There’s a
brief pause on the phone, then.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: …Mr. Dean is not available right now.
Can I take a message?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No. Just tell him I called. Bishop hangs up,
stares at the phone. The doorbell rings. Bishop opens it to find a DHL
COURIER on his doorstep. Bishop is suddenly casual, friendly. The public
face of Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Hello, Don. They make you drive all the way
out here this evening?</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: That’s the job.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: You find tires for that old FleetMaster?</p>
<p>****: No, not yet. Maybe when I do, we’ll take it out for a spin. Say
hello to the wife for me.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Will do. Good night, Arthur. The man heads back
towards his truck. Bishop tears away the strip that seals the envelope,
a small USB jump-drive slides into his hands. The friendly grin on
Bishop’s face… evaporates.</p>
<p>****: We should all be so lucky. Click. The phone goes dead. Almost
at the same time, the glowing red light on the jump-drive turns GREEN.
Bishop’s PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages. A few medical
charts… and then a photograph: Harry McKenna. The new mark.</p>
<p><strong>through the jeweler’s loup</strong>: Bishop is working on a
hearing aide. Tweezers adjust a tiny chip, slot it into place… Phone
rings. Bishop eyes it for a beat. Snaps it up. The voice on the other
end is world weary, professional. DEAN.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Bishop. I heard you called. Hey, you get the
stuff I sent you?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That’s what I called about. I know him. I
think there might be a</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hold on a second. A long pause. Just air on
the line. Bishop stares at his work in front of him, his research on
McKenna tacked to the wall. Dean’s voice comes back as suddenly as it
departed.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No, it’s been decided. This one’s a go. You
take care of yourself, Bishop. The line goes dead. Bishop stares at the
phone for a second, sets it down. He looks up at Harry’s picture on the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s voice</strong>: They want to talk. I’m picking you
up in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s voice</strong>: Send your people home. I don’t want
anyone I don’t know near you today. I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna’s voice</strong>: …Thank you, Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry. My bad. The guy at the counter
shrugs, turns for a mop. Bishop quickly reaches into the McKenna bag,
switches a wrapped sandwich for one he brought.</p>
<p><strong>security #2</strong>: Hey, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>security #1</strong>: Actually, call central. I’m not – And
with that, he’s suddenly up and MOVING towards the bathroom. Security #2
raises his radio.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You ever wonder what the last day of your
life will feel like, Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You keep standing next to that window, maybe
you’ll be able to tell me. McKenna looks over, smiles weary. He looks
exhausted. He goes to his desk, picks up a tie, looks to Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: This turns out alright, I’m going to send
you a dozen Thai hookers and a case of Cuban Esplandidos. You can return
the hookers if you want, but the cigars…</p>
<p>****: I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You will, my friend. For these, you
will.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Why the change of security?</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: …What? Beat. Bishop SLAPS the STOP button.
Elevator jerks to a halt. Bishop gets a finger into the doors, PRIES
them open.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Arthur…? McKenna looks at the effort,
sighs. Lets Bishop help him down. Halfway through, BALANCE SHIFTS,
McKenna starts to fall. Bishop STEADIES him. McKenna STARES at Bishop,
concerned. Bishop nods, heading towards the STAIRS, pocketing a small
hearing aide as he goes. ON MCKENNA, touching the hearing aide in his
ear…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What the hell…? McKenna moves in, pushes
Bishop aside.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna’s p.o.v.</strong>: His SECURITY. Only there are two
new faces in the garage. Replacements packing weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: This isn’t good, Arthur…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Listen to me. Stay here. I’m going to check
it out.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Bishop, those men are armed…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Harry, relax. I know what I’m doing. And
Bishop slips out the door, shutting it behind him.</p>
<p><strong>close on his hearing aide</strong>: The sounds of gunfire is
coming from it. BLAM! BLAM! More shots, then the sound of POUNDING on
the door.</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s voice</strong>: Harry! It’s a trap! RUN!!! The door
flies opens and Bishop LURCHES IN, gun raised. McKenna starts up the
stairs, breathing hard. Behind him, he can see Bishop, gun lined back at
the door. BLAM! BLAM! Gunshots assault his eardrums.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Come on! If we can get to the roof I can
hold them off! Come on! McKenna GULPS AIR, staggers on…</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: …You. Bishop nods. McKenna CACKLES which
turns into a scream as PAIN sends him reeling. He falls, hitting his
head. Blood rolls down his face.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: You bastard. You… Sonofabitch. You didn’t
have the balls… The balls to AARRRGHHHH! He CONVULSES. Tears stream down
his face. His body HEAVING, not giving up the ghost. ON BISHOP. We know
it’s in there. But it doesn’t show. Instead he checks his watch,
calculates time…</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Oh God. Oh, Jesus Christ help me.</p>
<p><strong>arrghhhh!!! arrrrghhhhhh!!!!</strong>: Please… Please…
Please… McKenna stops struggling, stares up at Bishop. Tears streaming
down his face.</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Please, Arthur, put me out of my misery.
Your father… Bishop checks his watch again, doesn’t meet McKenna’s eyes.
Checks the stair door, looks over the building edge…</p>
<p><strong>mckenna</strong>: Please. I’m scared. I’m really god damn
scared… Suddenly Bishop MOVES. Lightening fast, wrapping up McKenna’s
head, fingers PRESSING expertly along arteries. McKenna STARES UP one
horrible second, then goes limp in his arms, dead. Bishop releases,
stands, stares down. For the first time, uncertainty in his face. Why
did he do that? He looks at the body, at his hands, out at the city.
Wipes his forehead with the back of a hand, furious at himself. He
reaches down, removes the hearing aide from McKenna’s ear, replaces it
with the original, turns away. SEEN FROM FAR ABOVE. McKenna’s body,
alone on the rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: His good works comfort all of us, even in
his going. We commit his remains to your earth, oh Father, and we pray
you vouchsafe him eternal life and that you bring comfort to those who
have been left behind. His only son, Steve, who is himself devoted to –
The Priest falters as Steve rises, moves away from the event. Bishop
tracks him as he wanders through gravestones.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Ghost…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: My condolences.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, Harry was a popular guy. Good to see so many of his
friends here. Touching. Bishop considers, tracks the attendees who pass
by a suited man as they leave… Each of them receiving and pocketing an
envelope as they do. Bishop looks back to Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Best grief money can buy. Give me a ride
home?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Looks like you have one.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, all of that. Empty limos. Fake guests.
All so that the papers print what an important and respected man Harry
was. Steve takes in the one or two guests, already counting their money
a few yards away. Shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well, I hope it’s what Harry would have
wanted. But it’s not for me. Beat. Bishop nods.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, what I don’t get is you. Harry
didn’t have any friends.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Your dad worked with my father a long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: So, just paying my respects.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So your old man was into all that?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, he was into all that.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well, that is refreshingly honest,
Mr. Bishop. What about you? Bishop doesn’t answer, steers the car up a
manicured drive.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. - through the windshield</strong>: An ESTATE. A main
house, lawns, pools, guest houses.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Why is it so comforting, when people surpass
even our lowest expectations?</p>
<p>****: Come on in, meet the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No, thanks. I’ve got to –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Please. A favor to me. None of these people
even remembered what today was. Bishop nods. They move into the scene.
People recognize Steve, hug or bump-fists. Steve’s friendly, but stays
locked on Bishop. Bishop observes it all, not uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do you believe in fate, Mr. Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Why? A basketball hoop has been set up near
the pool. Young men take turns dunking and then landing in the
water.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think maybe we’re all doomed to become our
fathers. I’ll probably die spoiled, corrupt, lonely and alone. Runs in
the blood. What would that make you?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You’re still young. You can do pretty much
whatever you please. AT THE HOT TUB, two girls kiss each other, filmed
in DV by an young entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You think so? Just chuck all this and go help
the children in South America, something like that?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well look at you, Mr. Bishop. You’re a
dreamer. Steve heads inside. A beat, Bishop follows.</p>
<p><strong>beauty #1</strong>: Well? Do you want to…?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, in fact I’m pretty sure that’s illegal in
this state.</p>
<p>****: Come on, this way. Steve leaves the Beauties disappointed,
moves up some stairs. Bishop follows.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, I went up there. To where my father
died.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hell of a place to die. Lonely… Bishop comes
abreast of Steve, also looks down. Removed from the party and the pool
area, a separate area of the estate contains an outdoor gym. Weights,
exercise equipment, a fighting matt and martial arts equipment all
present.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That all yours?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: If the body is weak, the mind can’t be
strong. Bishop nods, impressed. Something about this young man. Engaged,
observing Bishop, but not needy.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Steve! Steve, man. It’s Louise. At the
door, a FRIEND of Steve’s is held back by security.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: She’s up in the bungalow. I think she might
really do it this time.</p>
<p>****: My girlfriend thinks that my father’s death is a good time to
kill herself. She thinks I’m not showing the appropriate human
reaction.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’ll let myself out.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, please. You’ve seen this much. Aren’t you
interested? I am. Off Bishop…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: A friend. Would have thought you’d have
started by now.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: This isn’t about me. It’s about you. You
need to watch. Steve crouches down, pours himself a shot from her
whiskey bottle. Something angry and cold in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay. I’m here. I’m watching.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You don’t believe I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, I know you, Louise. You’ll do just about
anything if it’ll get you enough attention.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You think you can hide behind that cool
attitude. Like nothing matters to you. But I know you. You care. You
feel.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do I? Louise blinks, scared a little. But she
pushes the fear away, picks up one of the razor blades. A beat, then
with a quick gesture, she slices across one wrist. Blood rises to the
surface, runs down her arms into the water. Steve doesn’t move. Neither
does Bishop. Louise picks up the second blade with the cut hand. Fingers
fumble, but she gets it. Slices across her other wrist.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …Wow.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: How long will it take?</p>
<p>****: Mr. Bishop? Bishop rises, looks down at her in the tub.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: How much do you weigh?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: A hundred and ten. His eyes take in her
body, the flow from her wrists…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You’re a hundred and twenty-five. It’ll take
an hour and a half, maybe two. When you get cold… then you’ll know
you’re close. Steve takes in Bishop in this moment, nods. Glances at the
clock: 9:30. Then he refills his drink, heads out to the patio outside.
Sits facing away from them.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: He’ll stop it. He thinks he’s above it all.
But he’s not. No one is. Bishop nods. Not clear if he’s agreeing or
observing.</p>
<p>****: Steve! Steve! I know you feel this. I know you’ll stop me.</p>
<p>****: If you don’t care anything about your life, why should I? Steve
looks to Bishop. He checks his watch. 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m getting cold. Please. I’m frightened.
I’m scared, Steve. Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring
outwards.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You can help her if you want. The sounds of
water, splashing. Louise arrives on the patio, a blood-stained robe
loosely pulled on around her. Mascara eyes ran. She stares down at
Steve.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You’re a bastard.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know what the kick of it is, Louise? If
you actually had the stones, then there’s be something for us. But in 30
seconds when you run down that path and all of those people go crazy
saving your life… Well, then we’ll be done.</p>
<p>****: I know. Catch-22. Life’s not fair.</p>
<p>****: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Maybe nothing. Maybe you never really knew
me. A beat. Louise, looking between the two men. She SWAYS on her feet
and Bishop puts a hand out, steadies her.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You’re a bastard, too. Both of you. Like
looking in some dark mirror.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Go on, Louise. You’ll do fine. The world’s
gonna love you. Louise steps away, turns, stumbling down the path into
the dark. A beat, the men just watching after her and then a SCREAM from
below. COMMOTION, ACTION. People rush to Louise, help her to the ground.
Others pulling out cell phones, call for help. Louise’s LOUD cries drift
back.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Would you have let her do it?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’ll never know, will we? Steve rises, heads
up a small path.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Everybody dies.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Sure. But it’s a whole other world when
you’re personally involved. There’s a very big tab that has to be picked
up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Such as? Bishop stops, looks down at the
action far below them.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Governments, cops, the military… we give
young men a licence and send them into it blind, thinking it’ll all be
okay. Because someone told them they had permission.</p>
<p>****: But when you cross over that line, you do it alone. Most
people, they stay that way from then on. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Everybody can kill. You take a mother,
protecting her child…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Sure. But that’s instinct. What I’m talking
about is up here… Knowledge of foresight. Intention. A person who knows
that the only way to truly be free of man’s laws, is to break his
highest one. Beat. It sits there, between them.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Why are you telling me all this?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Why did you want me to see that little stunt
with your girlfriend? Bishop stares down the hill at the commotion. Ants
swarming.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: These aren’t your people, are they? You
don’t have “people.” Your life is crowded, but you’re alone. Steve
unconsciously nods, then:</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, you’re right. You grow up spoiled,
rich, like me… Only thing you really learn to recognize in people is
when someone wants something from you.</p>
<p>****: What do you want, Mr. Bishop? What are you doing here? Bishop
considers Steve, thrown. Then…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Thanks for the tour. It’s been
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yes, it has. Bishop turns, heads back down
towards the estate. Steve watches him go.</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: The WOMAN, speaking to him from her
beautiful apartment. Similar to the one we saw. She leans against a
large plate glass windows, shirt and panties, sipping wine.</p>
<p><strong>woman on tv</strong>: Hey, you. Jesus, what a night. We went
to opening of Fernando’s new restaurant and Betty was there wearing –
well, whatever we call those things she wears… ON THE STACK OF DVDs.
There must be twenty of them.</p>
<p><strong>woman on tv</strong>: I miss you. Everybody says hi, of
course. But with me… it’s like I feel you there with me, even when
you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: She pulls her shirt off over her head,
faces the camera again, topless.</p>
<p><strong>woman on tv</strong>: I feel the way you touch me… Bishop
rises, blows out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s p.o.v.</strong>: Laughter, smiles, hands touching,
hands waving mid-story, lips parting. Woman’s hands touching their
necks, eyes sparkling, men laughing, wallets flashing… Bishop rises
suddenly, his hand going to his wallet, trying to get out of there. ROOM
SWAYS. He steadies himself, moves towards the exit. People look over,
alarmed as he grabs backs of chairs to steady himself. VERTIGO LOOMING,
sounds DISTORTING and suddenly he’s FALLING into blackness…</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: Quite a collection you have here.
Military?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: Does this hurt? Bishop smiles,
recognizing the nature of the touch.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes, a little. The doctor lets her hands
rest just a fraction too long, then moves across the room, writes in a
chart.</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: Any next of kin, anybody we can
notify? How about an acquaintance?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Am I going to die?</p>
<p>****: No, not today. Bishop reaches for his shirt, slips it on.</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: You damaged your deltoid muscle. But
that doesn’t explain the anxiety attack.</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: Any unusual stress recently?
Something at work? I’m prescribing Cataflam for the pain and Paxil for
the stress and I’m going to give you my card. If you have any other
episodes… or if you need anything else, don’t hesitate to give me a
call. She holds out her card. He looks at her, lets her stay that way
for a moment, then takes the card. She looks away.</p>
<p><strong>female doctor</strong>: You can pay at the desk.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mr. Bishop! Arthur! Please, I need to speak
with you. The front door opens. Bishop, fronting sleepy. Steve is
ENERGIZED, LIT, eyes blazing.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I wanna show you something. Please. It’ll be…
It’ll be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Gonna tell me what the big surprise is?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’d rather show you. I know, melodramatic.
But I think it’ll be worth it to you. Bishop TENSES, almost
imperceptible as Steve pilots the car into the underground structure
beneath McKenna Holding Corp.</p>
<p><strong>close on the pictures</strong>: Harry McKenna. Dead on the
roof. Other details. The doors, the elevator shaft, everything. PAPERS,
coroner’s documents. Medical photographs.</p>
<p>****: Maybe it’s time you start talking.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know what that says? My dad didn’t die of
a heart attack. I mean, he was dying of a heart attack, but that’s not
what killed him. The blood flow to his brain was cut off, his brain died
before his body. Somebody killed him. On Bishop, considering Steve.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What do the police think?</p>
<p>****: The police? They don’t want to hear about this. I mean, they’ll
look into it. But they don’t very much like the idea that they totally
missed this one and it’d be just easier for everyone if I would shut the
hell up.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They killed him. Here, on the roof of his own
building. His own security all around. Why here? Why even kill him, if
he was already dying?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: To make a point. That no one’s safe. That
they can get to anyone, whenever they want to.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: So what am I doing here? Bishop, supremely
alert, listening. Tracking shadows…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I got my black belt in Karate when I was
nineteen. I’ve studied Judo since I was six.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, you’re not. Most people are, but you’re
not. If I came at you right now, I’d wind up dead as my father, wouldn’t
I? Bishop doesn’t answer. Steve breaks away, looks down at the place
where his father died.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Same as if I tried to exact justice for my
father. These men, what this is… It’s something you know about, isn’t
it?</p>
<p>****: Something you could teach me.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I didn’t get the impression you even liked
Harry very much. Steve SURGES forward. Real anger, intensity boiling
over.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You really going to stand there and judge how
much I loved my father? What the hell do you know about it? Bishop,
hearing this. A nerve touched.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Besides, this isn’t just about Harry. Harry’s
dead, may he rest in peace. But this is about me. They came here and
they killed my father. They did that to me.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You want revenge. Steve doesn’t answer. A
long moment between them. Steve turns, looks out over the city.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know the word “Nemesis”? It’s not
actually a word. It’s a name. She was one of the Greek goddesses. Of
anger. Retribution against any mortal who became too proud.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: The executor of divine justice. It’s a
beautiful idea, don’t you think? Justice.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Justice? A beat. Bishop shakes his head,
turns, starts to walk back towards the elevators. Steve collects his
papers, angry.</p>
<p>****: Fine. Fine. In case you haven’t noticed, I now have a couple of
million dollars to spend on this, so I will find them myself and I’ll
deal with them myself and if I wind up dead trying, you can bury me
right next to dear old dad –</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Jesus, stop your whining. SLAP! No one’s
ever spoken to Steve that way. He STARES. A stillness between them, even
the wind slows, waiting…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Corner of sixth and Grand. Tomorrow morning.
7:00 am. Don’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I won’t. Beat. Bishop nods, starts to leave,
turns back…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: And Steve… no more surprises like this,
okay? Steve nods. Bishop goes. On Steve, watching as the elevator doors
erase the older man.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Stay focused. This is a test. Bishop moves
down the rows, pulling drapes away as he does. Nude BODIES are revealed.
Men, women, teens. In some, the reason for their death is obvious.
Others aren’t telling.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You want to know about killing, look around.
Steve does, a little creeped out, but keeping it cool.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: The act of killing, is an end in itself. Any
other motive keeps it from being pure.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: The psychopath has no motive.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No, he’s driven, compelled, by his sickness.
He’s as much the victim as those he kills. More drapes fall. Dead eyes
stare up at them.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: But when you make your own law, you’re
responsible to no one else but yourself. Maybe you’re free…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Do you? This isn’t some idea anymore. This
is the real thing. You still with me?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I am. Another drape falls. A beautiful woman.
No signs of injury.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Ever heard the term “Mechanic” used outside
of its normal meaning?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: My father used it. A dealer… a guy who works
the tables. Bishops smiles, shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Or a… killer. A hit man. Bishop just stares.
Steve shakes his head, looks away from Bishop, winds up staring at a
dead man. Laughs to himself.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I had you pegged as… a security consultant.
Maybe ex-military. Someone who… protects people.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Maybe I do.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Or maybe you just get paid to kill people.
Bishop nods his head yes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So why let me in? I mean, I know what I want.
What do you get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …Times are changing. Security is better
trained, more lethal. Sometimes I could use a partner.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bullshit. Bishop nods, smiles. He moves away
from the tables, leaves Steve standing in the middle of it all.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: In this… there isn’t room for those who are
outside of it. There’s too much isolation. Friendships can’t work.
Eventually everyone expects you to account. The isolation… becomes a
liability. You stand out. Standing out… isn’t good. Steve smiles, shakes
his head.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You need a… friend?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: An associate.</p>
<p>****: I’m offering to teach you something that most people can’t be
taught.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Because you think I’m a natural.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That remains to be seen. But you’re alone in
there, aren’t you? That’s… the prerequisite. Steve continues to stare at
the bodies. Bishops starts towards the exit.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Think it over.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop…</p>
<p>****: When I find the men who murdered my father. You help me to kill
them.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You may never find them.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You didn’t answer my question. A beat. Bishop
nods.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m still at 130.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Too fast.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I know. I’m working on it. Bishop nods, picks
up the rifle, sights. BLAM! 1,000 yards away, the bullet IMPACTS the
head-rest of an abandoned car. Bishop looks to Steve who gives up,
raises the handgun. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Three shots. Three misses. Steve
tosses down the gun, frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You were still over 100.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: There are no perfect situations. You fought
me at 100%, so you were winning. But in doing so, you gave up your
shooting option.</p>
<p>****: It’s all about choices. Always. Bishop starts to leave.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop… What’s your 100% look like? Bishop
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>looming ahead</strong>: An existing accident. A beer truck
jack- knifed across the freeway. Bishop BRAKES, fighting for control.
Steve SWERVES his car, too fast, it goes into a SPIN… CLIPS another car,
gains air and PLOWS ass-backwards into the side of the beer truck.
BISHOP’S CAR slides to a stop. Bishop gets out, tracks: STEVE, climbing
out of the Maserati onto the hood protruding from the side of the truck.
LAUGHING, WHOOOPING at the sky. Bishop approaches, sees that hundreds of
bottles of BEER have cascaded out of the punctured truck. Steve wipes
blood from a cut on his forehead, grabs a beer and cracks it, swigs as
he sits on the Maserati hood. He grabs another, tosses it to Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Come on up, man. The view is beautiful.
Bishop takes in the situation, the small crowd gathering… he jumps up,
sits on the hood of the car with Steve, both leaning back against the
cracked windshield.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You lost control.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You think? Steve puts out his beer. A
hesitation, then Bishop clinks beers with him. They both drink.
Stretched out in front of them, the highway seems to go on forever.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You ever think about just… going? Leaving.
Never turning back?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I have… responsibilities. I have a cat. A
beat. Steve LAUGHS loud. Bishop laughs. Maybe the first time in ages.
They drink, watch the sun move lower in the sky as emergency vehicles
approach.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, looking at these, a person might
think maybe there’s a screw or two loose up there… Steve catches sight
of a manila envelope in front of his empty place.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Is this what I think it is?</p>
<p>****: Don’t be so eager. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Who’s the Mark?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …I am.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: It’s not good enough to simply follow your
Mark and attack him. Most of these people know they’re targets. They’ll
be watching for you. … A moment, then Steve enters the frame, tracking
Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You need to understand the location, control
the situation. You’re looking for escapes, security, police presence…
Bishop passes two COPS, squeezes between two parked produce trucks
towards the row of shops that border the square.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Interest you in anything? Bishop takes in the
man, eyes check polished reflective surfaces, back to the man. Bishop
points to a watch.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That’s a beauty.</p>
<p>****: You know your instruments…</p>
<p><strong>steve’s p.o.v.</strong>: Bishop exits, heading back into the
market.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Most of all, you need to answer this
question: “How does this man die here today?” Bishop passes a butcher
cutting into a slab of meat. Steve follows behind Bishop, lost in the
sea of people.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Everybody, everyday, has a way to die. You
have to find it.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: They don’t make that anymore. That’s a
classic. I can let you have it for three hundred…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …Good. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Good? That’s all you got? How about God damn
perfect, man?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Don’t get cocky.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Broad daylight. A thousand witnesses. Man
takes a wrong step. Excuse me if I take a moment to appreciate myself.
Because that was poetry. You just can’t bring yourself to be impressed,
can you? Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has
fallen in the gutter. Picks it up, tries to dry it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s that? You’re what? Oh, you are
impressed? No, come on, you don’t have to say that. Really, I’m fine
with – You what? You’ve never seen someone better? Wow.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: All right. You did very well.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Damn straight I did. And now, in celebration
of me, I’m taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses… what?
Something about Bishop’s serious gaze has stopped Steve. Bishop reaches
into his jacket, places a gun in Steve’s hands. A confused beat, Steve
conceals the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: There’s a man behind me. Look up once, then
look away. Don’t look back. Steve glances up. We realize we’re right in
front of the watch store. The OWNER is pulling the steel grate down over
his store, closing for the day.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You got him?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah. Look…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You did good here. Really good. But this was
just a game. That man… is your graduation.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: He owns the watch store.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I know. I meant… what did he do? Bishop comes
close, FOCUSED.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’ve taught you how to kill without anyone
knowing there was a murder. I’ve taught you to be invisible. But that’s
strategy, not killing. The real test… it’s the actual killing, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Do you want this? Be very sure. Because you
can walk away.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No. I’m ready. Bishop studies him… nods.
Turns to go.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop… We’re right here, where you wanted us
to wind up. You knew where I’d hit you, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …School’s out. Bishop leaves. Steve watches
him go. Stuck. Helpless. He turns back. The Owner is headed home for the
day.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Who do you think that is, Luna? He takes a
card out of his wallet, studies it. It’s from the flirtatious doctor. He
pulls out his phone, dials.</p>
<p><strong>steve’s p.o.v.</strong>: Two stories up, a lit apartment. The
WATCH STORE OWNER crosses by one of the lit windows.</p>
<p><strong>tracking across the room</strong>: To the front HALLWAY.
Steve stands in the hallway, motionless. He’s just closed the front door
behind him. In his hands, a lock-pick set which he now pockets and pulls
out the gun Bishop gave him.</p>
<p>****: It’s open!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I’ll just be a minute. A GLIMPSE of
the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a vanity. She glances
back, smiles warm. Laughs a little when she sees the doll.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: It’s for a friend. Bishop awkwardly sets the
doll down near the front door, moves on, into the apartment.
Restless.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry I was away so long this time. I
had some complications –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Don’t be. He turns. She’s emerged
from the bedroom, adjusting the dress she’s just pulled on. Beautiful.
She comes up to him, kisses him. He doesn’t respond. She backs off,
moves to the kitchen to pour two wines,</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You know who I saw yesterday?</p>
<p>****: Bradley Fliescher. He and Ginny have this little cottage up the
coast they hardly use. I was thinking, maybe next week you and I should
go. Approaching, handing him a wine.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You and me, the whole weekend. What would we…
do? She approaches him, sexy. Touches him, intimate. He stares at her,
blank. She recovers fast, moves off.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Of course why do we need that? We have each
other right here.</p>
<p><strong>in the living room</strong>: The owner pauses, enjoying the
crescendo of the music. Eyes closed for a moment. Then they open… …
Steve is standing in the doorway to the living room, the gun pointed at
the owner. The owner sees him, becomes motionless. The two men staring
across the space between them… and then everything happens very fast.
The Owner LURCHES to the side with surprising speed and agility just as
Steve FIRES! The bullet catches the Owner in the side, SPINNING him
around. He CRASHES to the floor… … but only for an INSTANT. THEN he’s
BACK ON HIS FEET, MOVING across the room! Steve tracks, pulls the
trigger again but the gun only “clicks” empty. The man reaches a coat
rack, grabs it in one fluid motion and is MOVING back at Steve who
barely has time to drop the gun and BLOCK the rack as it SLICES through
the air at him. The Owner HITS and HITS again. Skilled, professional,
martial-arts trained. Steve blocking one, two, the third hit connects,
sends Steve REELING back, crashing through the watch-repair table. The
Owner leaps at him with the rack. Steve is BARELY able to catch the end
before it impales him. The two men, BREATHING, STRUGGLING, the Owner
FORCING the point lower towards Steve’s face… … Blood pools on Steve’s
shirt. Steve and the Owner both track it. The man is bleeding badly from
the bullet wound. A split-second calculation and the man abandons the
coat- rack, races across the room as Steve clambers to his feet. The man
reaches the far wall, hits a RELEASE. The wood paneling slides open,
revealing a CAR-15 fully automatic assault rifle with a silencer. The
man grabs it, opens up! Bullets CHEW through furniture, drywall, glass
searching for Steve who DIVES into the hallway, retreating as the man
comes forward, firing in deadly precise BURSTS. Steve hides behind a
wall which ERUPTS, blown to bits. He stumbles through a doorway into a
KITCHEN.</p>
<p>****: Do you know what I dreamed? I dreamed you and I had a child…
Bishops turns from the screen, walks away. Beat, she silences the TV,
moves to join him.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know, it’s crazy. I don’t want to pin you
down. I know you need your freedom. I just… sometimes I miss you so
much… He’s staring at her, oddly.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What? A beat. His eyes move down to her sofa
where another man’s tie has been discarded. A moment, then she shakes
her head, angry with herself. The pretense dropping. The real woman
scooping up the tie, tossing in a drawer.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m sorry. Really, I am. I just… You didn’t
give me any warning this time.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, Bishop. It won’t happen again.</p>
<p>****: It’s okay. Really. It’s okay.</p>
<p>****: Who… are… you? Steve doesn’t answer, just keeps PRESSING. And
finally… the man’s eyes film over. He dies. Steve just KEEPS PRESSING.
Locked. Horrified. Staring into the dead man’s face. Finally, he rolls
off. Flops back against the wall, broken, bleeding, weeping… He SCREAMS.
From the heart, the guts, releasing EVERYTHING.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey, Bishop. You okay? He stares into his
wine. Raises the glass to drink. His hand shakes.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Do you remember, what you wanted to be, when
you were a little girl? She hears it, it wounds her. Looks down.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean… I was thinking of
me. She looks up, clear eyes. She’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No, it’s okay. I wanted to be a Marine
Biologist. I used to watch those Jaques Cousteau movies and just…
dream.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p>****: I was beautiful. He hears the simple truth of it, nods,
respectful. He rises and goes to the music box on the mantle, takes out
his wallet and removes the twenty $100 bills.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Don’t worry about it this time. On the house.
A beat. Then he slides the money under the box as before.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: We all gotta make a living. He leaves,
grabbing the doll as he goes. She watches him go, strangely. Sadness
breaking through her cool.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Thank you, thank you! Bishop! Mom!</p>
<p><strong>mom!</strong>: She takes off back into the living quarters of
the house. The two men exchange looks, uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I saw that in a… I’m sorry, I probably
should have asked. A small beat that says “Yes, you should have.”</p>
<p><strong>grocer</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Bishop. You have a
good night.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …Can I ask you a question? STEVE sits on his
sofa in the dark, head lowered.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Are you surprised to see me? Beat. Steve
reaches over, turns on a table lamp as he looks up. His face is BRUISED,
bloody. His clothing, stained and ripped. In his hand, Bishop’s gun from
the sideboard. Bishop TENSES, doesn’t react. Steve spits blood,
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Guy owns a watch-store, yet keeps a million
dollar apartment. Supposedly sits on his ass all day, yet takes stairs
double-time.</p>
<p>****: It was sitting there, right in front of my face, wasn’t it?
Bishop doesn’t respond.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Was that the man who killed my father?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: There’s a code, to what we do. It may not be
rational, but it matters. The man’s name was Harry Xiao. He was a
Mechanic. Last year a US Representative died in a fire… along with his
wife and two children.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: A few months ago, a CEO vacationing in Costa
Rica was found dead with his wife. Because the woman was tortured, the
authorities believed it was drug related.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop! –</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Civilian casualties are very effective at
hiding intent, but there’s a line —</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t give a damn about that! You haven’t
answer my question: Did he kill my father? Bishop doesn’t react,
then…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You should put that behind you now. Steve
nods, swallowing emotion. Bishop starts to move and Steve is suddenly
there, still angry, pointing the gun right in Bishop’s face.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I could have died today!</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Blind fucking luck! Look at me! You tried to
kill me! That man was… he was unstoppable.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: But you stopped him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Fuck you! You sonofabitch! Give me one good
reason I don’t blow you away right now! ONE GOD DAMN</p>
<p><strong>reason!</strong>: FAST, Bishop SLAPS the gun away, PINS Steve
up against the wall. Cold.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Now I’m sorry if you got a little scared.
But this isn’t coaching girl’s softball, is it? This is life or death.
Every time you go into this, somebody dies.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Every time, it’s you or the other man. So
stop your crying. He releases Steve who falls to the floor, sucking
air.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You got what you came for, congratulations.
You’re done Go back to your friends, your women, your whole beautiful
life.</p>
<p>****: That used to be my front door. Try to close it on the way out.
Bishop starts to go. Steve’s words stop him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop. Those things… they don’t mean
anything to me. This, makes sense. I don’t know why. But I think I was
meant to do this.</p>
<p>****: And like you said, you could use someone. Bishop studies Steve
a long beat. Shakes his head, goes into his study. Steve follows.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: We should all be so lucky. The phone goes
dead. The light on the drive turns GREEN. Bishop’s PRINTER fires up. It
starts printing out pages… ON BISHOP and STEVE. Watching the pages feed
out.</p>
<p><strong>photos</strong>: A new Mark at an elegant gathering of
powerful men and women. Tall, powerful, entitled. His arm around a
Turkish beauty in an elegant black one-piece. Emerging from a limousine
at a large public event. Security EVERYWHERE. The same beauty on his
arm. Charts. Height, weight, medical history. Bank accounts, figures.
Leases, deeds of property.</p>
<p><strong>a last photo</strong>: Peeling out of the printer… THE WOMAN,
the beauty, in a diplomatic power-suit.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You get started. I’ll make coffee.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop… Nemesis. Devine Retribution. …What
did she do? Beat. Unsaid questions asked, unanswered.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay. Okay. Forget I asked.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Slow down as soon as you get inside.
Security station will be to your left… Steve passes through a door,
pauses as two guards talk in the open doorway to a security control
room. Monitors visible.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: How many views?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sixteen, no, eighteen. Four second intervals.
One of the men notices Steve who starts forward to ask a question. The
man points him down the hallway towards the consulat’s reception.
Steve’s eyes track monitors.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Make that four and a half seconds.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: These guys are packing Israeli-made Uzis.
Couple are actual military. Bishop takes in the other buildings across
the street, then moves his sight up the embassy, adjusts a control</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. - through the scope</strong>: Large tinted glass
windows suddenly turn transparent. Bishop scans, find The Mark’s HUSBAND
on the bed watching TV, bored. He scans again… finds The Mark in the
adjoining room, on the phone and ANGRY. Bishop touches a switch on the
telescope and a small LASER projects. The woman’s voice fills Bishop’s
headset:</p>
<p><strong>turkish envoy’s voice</strong>: No, we’re literally locked in
here. I’m supposed to be presenting at the UN but I can’t do that if
everyone is going to panic about security…</p>
<p><strong>turkish envoy’s voice</strong>: …This is America. People
don’t just kill people here. Then she shuts the door. Bishop moves his
focus upwards to a glassed-in terreriam-like structure on the rooftop.
An indoor swimming pool. “Click.” “Click.” More pictures.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Work it again.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She never leaves. It’s like they know we’re
coming.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Maybe they do. Steve nods, continues pacing,
scoops up Bishop’s cat and strokes her. Bishop watches him.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Falls off the rooftop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Falls or jumps? Steve moves to the wall of
pictures, his gaze lingering on shots of her on vacation is a
swimsuit.</p>
<p>****: I tell you one thing, killing her is not the first thing that
jumps to mind… what? Bishop HEARS this, frowns, moves forward. His eyes
scan: The Mark at the pool, getting ready to swim. The security…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Nothing. I’m going for a run. You wanna
come?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Let me ask you something. You ever not feel
like running 5 miles?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You like it? Steve REACTS. Didn’t hear
Bishop come in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t know. Feels disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Always made me feel… understood.</p>
<p>****: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: The Mark is a beautiful woman. Before
arriving at her current position, she enjoyed the way men looked at her.
That’s gone now. She needs to be taken seriously. She hates that men
only see the beauty. Magazines, heads of state, all focusing how what a
piece of tail she was. Like you did. Steve SQUINTS… Bishop slaps a
picture of the pool, the Mark swimming. Two SECURITY AGENTS
positioned.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Why is he standing here? Wouldn’t he get
better coverage… here?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …He can’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: He can’t see her. Neither of them can. Beat.
PHONE RINGS. Bishop snaps it up.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey, Bishop. Catch you at a bad time? Bishop
doesn’t respond. Waits…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Always the conversationalist. Anyway, just
calling to say we’d like you to go ahead with this one. As soon as you
can. Click. Phone goes dead. Bishop hangs it up. Steve looks at him,
anticipating… Bishop nods.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Run it again.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Patrol number three moves down the service
corridor at 18:50. Five minute window after to make it up top. Three
minute climb to position. That’s 18:54. Three minute window to engage.
Shake, stir, add lime and enjoy. Bishop smiles, looks away.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How’d you get into it? Bishop looks back,
surprised. Checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …This business, it’s not like there’s a
degree you can go get. It’s like most trades, it gets passed down.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: My father was very good, better than I’ll
ever be. But no one controls 100%. The nature of the work is that some
people know who you are and what you do.</p>
<p>****: A man told his girlfriend, to impress her. The girlfriend told
some people she owned money to… Bishop finishes his glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I was young. It took me four months to find
the people, another to find the girl, and she gave me the Man. That’s
how I… “got into it.”</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You ever wish you just… walked away? Let it
go?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Sure. Every day. But I wasn’t wired that
way.</p>
<p>****: What about you? Beat. Steve and Bishop, oddly locked… BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! Three SMALL EXPLOSIONS in the kitchen. FLAMES shoot out of
the galley. A cook stumbles out, on fire. A waiter douses him with
water. People SCREAM! Alarms BLARE! Steve and Bishop. They haven’t moved
a muscle.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Here we go… And they’re MOVING.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Fire in the restaurant. Patrols two and
five, we’re closing down the front entrance.</p>
<p><strong>security pro</strong>: Excuse me, ’mam. There’s a fire next
door, nothing to worry about. The Mark nods. The man locks the door
behind him, crosses the room, leaves through the main door,
professional.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey! You need to get out! Whole building is
going up! Bishop and Steve move on as the startled employees leave. They
move down five doors, push into…</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. - the embassy across</strong>: Changing its security
pattern. Men are leaving posts on exterior patios, locking doors. Below,
the excess manpower is channeled to the front. Bishop turns, FIRES OUT
THE WINDOW. A Cable streaks across, SINKS into the wall of the embassy
30 feet away. Bishop HOOKS the cable on this side, tosses the gun in the
box. Steve seals it with tape, slaps a return label on it. He crosses
the hall, tosses it in the MAIL ROOM. When he returns, Bishop’s already
secured the cable outside.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>of underwater.</strong>: ACROSS THE SPACE. The indoor guard
checks in on his radio. Looks up as the DOOR nearest him swings open. He
rises, approaches the door, curious. Looks out.</p>
<p><strong>his p.o.v.</strong>: The rooftop, lit by security lights, the
strobing of the firetrucks below. Dark shadows. He hears a RUSTLING, a
BANGING. Torn, he glances backwards. Can’t see the Mark in the pool from
here, but can hear her strokes.</p>
<p><strong>with the mark</strong>: She kicks hard, dives under… And
we’re in her P.O.V. The far wall approaching, then we REVOLVE as she
turns, now looking UP at the surface as she backstrokes to the surface,
BREAKING THE SURFACE, now swimming face up to the bright lights hanging
from the girdered ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>across the roof</strong>: The first guard reaches the source
of the noise: A plastic bag, caught in a revolving air vent. He pulls it
free.</p>
<p><strong>down at her!!!!</strong>: She opens her mouth to scream…
WHUUMPH! He goes in, taking her with him underwater, his momentum
carrying them both several feet under. She TWISTS in his arms, fighting.
Screaming, bubbles FLOWING from her mouth! ABOVE THE SURFACE. It’s
silent. No sign of the violent struggle going on below the surface.
ACROSS THE ROOM. Guard number one returns, glances up towards the pool.
Doesn’t hear anything. He sits back in his chair. UNDERWATER. The
struggle is violent, silent, terrible in it’s inevitable conclusion. The
Mark writhes and jerks but Bishop holds her tight, always pulling her
away from the surface. Finally, the fight goes out of her. She goes limp
in his arms. He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes. Then lets her
go, rising slowly to the surface. AT THE SURFACE. Bishop just breaks,
breathing in, silent. He raises himself slightly, sees the guard at his
post. ACROSS THE ROOM. The guard glances back towards the pool, hasn’t
heard anything for a little bit… BAM! BAM! BAM! A new noise from outside
gets his attention again. He heads out, hand on his sidearm…</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: It’s the second time it’s come open. She
still swimming?</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Oh hell… The Mark floats face-up in the
pool, just under the surface.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How did it go –</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Not yet. As if on cue, an ALARM BLARES.
Excited voices come on over an embassy wide PA System. VOICES from the
next room. Bishop opens the chute again as Steve cracks a glowstick,
puts it between his teeth, swings his legs in, and DROPS. ACROSS THE
ROOM. The door to the dressing room opens, armed guards flood in, along
with Embassy officials speaking on radios. The room is empty.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Alright, you gotta admire that. You gotta
admit, we are a spooky good team…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s like one moment we’re there… the next
moment… He ROLLS UP the door. STARES at a NEW WALL OF CEMENT BRICKS.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …we’re fucked. Bishop takes in the problem,
starts to solve it. He tracks left right, considering options…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There wasn’t any sign of this on the plans. I
went over them fifty times!! This isn’t supposed to be here! This can’t
be here! Bishop holds up a finger. “Shhhhhh” They LISTEN. A soft
“beeping.” Both men PEER around the edge of the metal door to where a
small box with a red light BLINKS.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop… what do we do!?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Duck… Steve looks at Bishop and BOOM! Doors
BLOW OPEN, THREE GUARDS burst through, machine guns raised and SPITTING…
Steve hits the deck. Watching Bishop, it’s like everything we’ve seen so
far was in slow motion. This is the real thing, unleashed. Bishop WRAPS
the first man up, uses his Kevlar vest as a shield to catch the fire
from the other two. The man SCREAMS as his arm breaks. Bishop gets
control of his weapon, focuses it on the other two. One is BLOWN back.
The other DIVES for cover. Fluid, Bishop REVERSES the man, pushes him
AWAY from him, coming up with TWO of the man’s Flash-bangs in each hand.
Each hand DIALS the grenade’s timers to two different settings,
simultaneously POPPING the levers. Second attacker FIRES a burst which
Bishop DUCKS, the bullets stitching across the first attacker, SLAMMING
him back, his rounds TEARING into the ceiling, showering Steve in
debris. Bishop THROWS the first grenade which reaches the attacker just
as he rises for another shot. BOOM!</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Hey! Hey! You still here?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …It was my fault. I was in charge of the
exit. I looked at every work order, every entry in the building
logs…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No one controls 100% That’s the nature of
the beast. Steve swallows, nods as Bishop brings the Buick around a last
corner, ACCELERATING at the closed gate in front of them, a Turkish
guard waving his arms frantically…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Hey! You did good in there. You hear me?. It
was asking a lot. You came through. Steve nods, processing, accepting.
Another TURN. Bishop slides the car to a stop in a covered lot. Across
from them, Bishop’s own Cobra waits. Behind them, the police car tears
by, lost.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …Yup.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So back there. That was one hundred percent?
Bishop looks over, gives nothing. Tiny smile.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do you think you know it, when you’ve made
the mistake you won’t survive? Or will it be like the Marks? Wake up on
top of the world, never know…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …Oh my God. This is a signed Hendrix Axis,
1967 release. This has gotta be worth… we have to play this. You have to
play this.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: That one… is for a special moment. Haven’t
found it yet.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You haven’t found the… Are you kidding? You
have to – what? Bishop’s eyes SHOOT open. He looks out the window where
a series of SEDANS are pulling up. Men get out, approach.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: This could get… interesting.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Mr. Bishop? Mr. Dean would like a moment of
your time. Off Bishop who… nods.</p>
<p><strong>steve’s p.o.v.</strong>: Down, below the fire, stuck to the
side of the interior cavity… a scrap of paper… Steve kills the fire,
reaches in, carefully removes the scrap of paper. A corner of a
photograph. A few buildings, distant, out of focus. Almost nothing.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. through a camera</strong>: The McKenna Holding Corp
building. Image focuses on the rooftop, shutter clicks. Steve lowers the
camera, looks at the display. He removes the scrap from Bishop’s
fireplace, compares it… the same buildings in the corner of the frame.
Perfect match. ON STEVE. No remaining doubt. Bishop killed his
father.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do it. I don’t care what it costs.</p>
<p><strong>i/e. sedan - morning</strong>: Driver pulls the sedan to a
stop in front of a large nondescript building. Bishop steps out, alone
on the street, passes through the morning commuters, and goes in.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You look like shit.</p>
<p>****: How does Harry McKenna’s son figure in?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: He’s going to be working with me from now
on.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You sure that’s wise?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Do I need your permission?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No… And for the record, I don’t believe you’d
ask for it. Dean grabs a remote control on his desk, points it at the
set of flatscreens on the wall which hum to life, muted. News reports
featuring the killing of the Turkish Embassador. Shots of the woman,
smiling. Helicopter shots of the pool structure. Words scroll: “Terror
on our soil.” “Assassination!” “US Envoy ejected from Turkey…”</p>
<p>****: That was my baby. But my baby has turned into an epic
shit-storm and so when the man who caused said epic shit storm suddenly
decides to do some soul-searching…</p>
<p>****: What are you doing, Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: The mistake was mine, not the kid’s.</p>
<p><strong>i don’t care.</strong>: Dean leans in, intense. Bishop
watches the screens. A screen changes to a commercial for a Bahamas
resort.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I am on some very fucking thin ice right now
which means you are on some very fucking this ice as well.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Someone I trained. That could be worth a lot
to you. Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the interior
blinds, raises one. From here they can see out over the office. Glimpses
of a dozen conversations. Other men and women at work. More than a
couple glance over towards Dean’s office. A predatory vibe.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: And here I thought we were both going to live
forever. Bishop smiles. Dean stares at him. Bishop stares back.
Suddenly, this becomes the moment, the decision…</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You know, in this business, you only get one
mistake. So nothing more like that. You take full responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes. The two men, face to face. Then Dean’s
phone rings. He turns to it, snaps it up.</p>
<p>****: Hey, Stanley. Yes, we’re all sorted out. I just need you to
–</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: The hit, on the woman. What was the reason?
Dean looks back, surprised, angered.</p>
<p>****: I’m calling you back. Dean clicks off, takes in this change of
rules. A dead seriousness infects his voice. Fear.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You know, this foul-up, McKenna’s son, it’s
all got some people’s panties in a real twirl.</p>
<p>****: This isn’t the time for questions. This is the time for
survival. Everyone… is expendable. Beat. Dean turns away, picks up the
phone again.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, get me Stan again…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Come on, baby. What’s the matter? Finally,
something does catch his attention: At the gate, a DHL Van pulling up,
the driver heading toward him. Steve lowers his glasses.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Steve! Steve…!?</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Bishop tense, in his study, holding the phone
which rings… rings… Steve’s voice comes on the voicemail: “Hi, this is
Steve. You know what to do.”</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Bishop, sitting on his couch. On the TV in
front of him, images from a protest in Turkey, an American flag burning.
Bishop’s eyes flick to the stack of DVDs from the woman. No. He keeps
watching the news images. His phone rings. He snatches it up.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re still alive.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Seems that way.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, can you meet me? Something I want to
talk with you about. Bishop, silent.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s important. Come up to the house. Please,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There you are. Thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What’s on your mind? Steve just smiles,
shakes his head. Bishop stares at him, tense, confused. Each trying to
read the other. Then Steve raises a bottle of whiskey to his mouth,
drinks. Bishop takes a step forward and… … LIGHTS WASH THE SPACE!
Explosions! SOUND FILLS THE AIR!</p>
<p><strong>surprise!</strong>: Bishop ducks, rolls, his hand moving
under his jacket… … but not coming out with his gun. He takes in a
surprise party, opening in front of him. Beautiful woman, LAUGHING,
blowing horns. Men, pouring champagne. STREAMERS falling to the ground
where seconds before they blew into the air, a large BANNER, illuminated
behind Steve: “HAPPY BIRTHDAY ARTHUR!” And Steve, standing on the board,
master of ceremonies, staring back at Bishop… oddly cool, dispassionate.
Then he smiles. Bishop rises. Women come to him, touch him, put a party
hat on him and give him small kisses with wishes of “Happy Birthday” as
he moves to the pool edge across from Steve.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: It’s not my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: When was the last time you celebrated your
real birthday? No response from Bishop. Steve nods, swigs the bottle
again. He’s lit, something fierce and fiery in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: See? You’re overdue, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Who are these people?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They think you’re a friend of mine, a
producer, from Canada.</p>
<p>****: In other words, they’re all your best friends.</p>
<p>****: So what movies have you made?</p>
<p>****: Oh, he makes the really violent, disturbing stuff. You wouldn’t
know it to look at him, I know, but what’s locked up away in there…
Frightening, man.</p>
<p><strong>model</strong>: God, I love those. Which ones –</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Mr. KcKenna has a creative relationship with
the truth. I don’t actually… The model glances around, unsure…</p>
<p><strong>model</strong>: Oh, okay. That’s funny. So what do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do? Bishop
doesn’t respond. He’s just staring down.</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s p.o.v.</strong>: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa
the models are perched on: The tear-strip from a DHL Envelope.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Come on, Mr. Bishop. We’re all waiting.
Bishop looks up at Steve who SMILES back. A beat, and then Bishop is up
and moving through the crowd, pushing by people LAUGHING, DANCING. He
almost runs into a bright blue-haired woman on the arm of a jockish
RAPPER.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Excuse me… He comes up short, realizes he’s
staring into the face of the Woman. She’s utterly different than we’ve
seen her. Tonight, she’s the clubbing party-girl. Dark lipstick, bright
blue wig, heavy eye-liner.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hi… This is strange. The Rapper she’s with
has found a group of his buddies. High- fives all around. He glances
around for his date…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Is he your…?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No, just a job. I have to…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I know. Go on. She nods, turns away. He also
turns, starts moving through the crowd, pushing through DANCING BODIES…
… and suddenly she’s back with him. No words. Lights and sound and dance
around them. She leans forward, kisses Bishop once. Backs off, smiles,
turns away and makes her way back to the guy she came in with who tucks
her under his arm without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse.
Bishop… staring. Turns away as the MUSIC STOPS. Steve’s voice fills the
outdoor space, amplified.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen! The man of the hour! A
SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes space for him.
Steve’s near the DJ, speaking on a mic.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I know that not many of you know my friend.
My good, dear… friend. I mean, he’s a man of few words… And he’s an art
lover! Did you know that? His home is covered with work. It’s amazing,
what you can find in there. Amazing. A weird beat. Steve, smiling
fierce.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Happy birthday, Arthur. Behind Steve, a
covered object. Steve now turns to it, pulls the cover off a PORTRAIT of
Bishop, clearly done by the Artist he collects. The image is twisted,
vivid, disturbing. As the crowd erupts in APPLAUSE the ARTIST himself
now comes forward, Steve’s arm around his shoulder and bumping fists
before the Artist heads on towards Bishop, shaking Bishop’s hand. Faces
BEAM. People CLAP. On Bishop, just looking at Steve who stares back…
unreadable.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, you forgot something. Steve’s there,
holding the portrait. Bishop nods, takes it.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Sorry… Sorry for leaving. I’m just not used
to –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No worries, man. It’s your party. You can
leave it.</p>
<p>****: It’s true, isn’t it? What you said to me the first time we
met.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This thing we do. Finally, you always do it
alone. Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces himself
to stop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Steve… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Uh-oh. I can feel some male bonding coming.
We gonna hug it out, Bishop?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No, I’m serious. Thank you. People don’t…
Anyway, it’s been a long time, since someone did something for me. Steve
looks back, nods. Strangely dark.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Happy Birthday, Arthur. Steve raises a hand,
shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink, and he turns and is gone, back to
the party. Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away.</p>
<p>****: Are you all having fun! SHOUTS and NODS. LAUGHTER.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I despise each and every one of you! MORE
SHOUTS, LAUGHTER. Steve LEAPS out into space. Perfect huge swam dive…
falling… HITTING the water. A moment of silence… did he? Was that deep
enough…? Steve ERUPTS out of the water. Party ROARS back into life.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Hey! Hey baby! Karen’s got some amazing E.
You need to come try… Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks.
We think he might slap her, then:</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Give me a moment. I’ll be right there. We’ll
do that amazing E. And he looks away, back down over the view. A
resigned loneliness settling into his features.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Huh. His eyes dart to an image of his DINING
ROOM. It looks like a still, until suddenly Bishops’ cat passes through
the frame. Bishops’ eyes dart, moving from frame to frame. The whole
interior of his life. His living room, bedroom, study, gym. All live
feeds.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Come on, Steve. We need you.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Whiskey. Neat. Lots of it. Bishop fumbles in
his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash. $100s and $20s. Eyes track.
At a booth, two EX CONS lock onto Bishop, one sporting a middle-finger
raised FU tattoo on his bare shoulder. Bishop pushes $100 forward.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That’s too much. Bishop grabs the shot,
down it. Pushes the empty shot and the cash back at the bartender.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>an hour later</strong>: Another shot is put down on the bar,
empty. Bishop wipes watery eyes, nods to the bartender to hit it again.
Bishop stares at the drink, then his attention is drawn to the bar TV.
Footage from the protests in Turkey is narrated by a news anchor,
speaking.</p>
<p><strong>female news anchor</strong>: …Intelligence services can
listen to our calls. But what about the rest of the world?</p>
<p><strong>female news anchor</strong>: Well, today the answer seems to
be ’No” as outrage over the assassination of the Turkish envoy Bahar
Miryem has forced the US to reverse its position, now saying that it
will not make it support of Turkey’s EU bid contingent on its
cooperation in the security agreement. Miryem had always advocated for
Turkish autonomy from</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …More. WHAM! WHAM! Bishop takes the punches,
no defense. Face punished. The guy backs off, slightly winded.</p>
<p><strong>ex con</strong>: Dude, you don’t want any more, give us that
money. Bishop shakes his head. WHAM! WHAM! Two more hits to the body.
Bishop just keeps taking the punishment. Seems to relish it. Spits
blood.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Look, I’ll give you my money, but you have
to promise me you won’t spend it all on lipstick and tampons. Ex Con #2
pulls a gun, puts it to Bishop’s head.</p>
<p><strong>ex con #2</strong>: You wanna die right here, motherfucker?
Bishop raises his eyes to the man. Not so drunk after all.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …Thank you.</p>
<p>****: Steve…? Where are you, baby?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hello? Bishop? He enters the study, sees the
WALL, the night’s work. In the center, a photograph of Dean, Bishop’s
boss.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: There you are. Bishop is leaning in from
outside. Nods to Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So who is he?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …US Government. NSA. Very well
protected.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You should see the other guy. Bishop TOSSES
Steve an object, goes back outside. Steve looks at it. A WELDER’S helmet
with visor.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: This… is liquid Semtex with a built in
combustible. Very volatile. Nice and shiny once it dries. But don’t…
scratch it. Bishop takes a knife, scratches the surface of the
coin-sized disc, then backs off, by Steve, back into</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So that’s how we take him out?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No. That’s just to focus the mind.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You makes bombs to focus your mind.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: What do you do? This one’s different. They
want it fast, and they don’t want it to look like an accident. Someone
wants to send a message.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Like with my father.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Yes. Like that.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Didn’t think that was your style.</p>
<p>****: First time for everything. Steve looks at Bishop. BOOM! Outside
the explosion CONCUSSES against the house. A window CRACKS. Steve
crouches, hands covering his head.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jesus… Bishop puts a hand out.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: There’s something I haven’t told you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …I broke a rule. I brought you in without
asking. So this hit, is a test. Of us, of our arrangement. If that man
is breathing three days from now… then they’ll need to make an example
of us. Do you understand? Steve … nods. Takes Bishop’s hand who pulls
him up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: So what you’re saying is you and I are stuck
with each other.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …For what?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: For getting you into this –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I knew what I was doing. Bishop considers,
nods.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Get packed.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …I count six… no seven at the main door.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. through the telescope</strong>: The front entrance of
the NSA building. The security check Bishop went through.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jesus they’ve got US Marines in there. Two at
the door, one… maybe another two out of sight. Bishop considers Steve,
locked to the telescope, the sharp point of the pen in his hand…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Fifth floor, corner office.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. through the telescope</strong>: Steve finds Dean, at
his desk, talking on the phone. Animated.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: … Alright, got him. He’s at his desk. We
could take the shot right from here.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Glass is three inches thick… Steve moves his
hand to turn on the laser Bishop used before to listen with…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: And has laser sensors.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Alright, fine. What are we doing here? Who is
this guy?</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. through the telescope</strong>: Dean shouts into the
phone, slams it down. Leaves his office. Bishop pulls away from the
telescope, hunkers down to wait.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Starting to get it?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, I’m getting that this isn’t a job. It’s
just a really complicated… suicide. Bishop smiles. Steve moves off,
restless.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, you can front sonofabitch all you
want, Bishop. You’re scared, too. You don’t really know how we’re going
to pull it off, do you? You ever think there’s some things that just
can’t be done?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Everyone has a death –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Really? Because, this guy? I look at this
guy, I don’t see his death. I see my death. And I don’t particularly
like the view. Bishop notes the lights going back on in Dean’s office,
returns to the telescope and starts jotting notes in a book.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. through the telescope</strong>: Dean back at his desk.
He looks exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And you know, as much as I like the quality
time, unless you can read lips, I don’t exactly see what we’re doing
here…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You read lips. Bishop glances at Steve, puts
his eye back to the camera.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.v. through the lens</strong>: EXTREME CLOSE on Dean’s
desk. A piece of paper on the blotter. “Click.” “Click.” Bishop pulls
the memory-card from the camera.</p>
<p>****: You any good with computers?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Everybody out. I’m serious. Get the fuck off
my property. A moment, then people start to flee. Only Louise, drink in
hand, moves towards Steve, confused.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Steve, baby…?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s the US Attorney’s office in New York.
He’s running. He’s trying to get out. Steve, trying to read Bishop’s
face, ZOOMING in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do you think we’re hitting him because of
what he’s done, or because he’s trying to get away with what he’s
done?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Does it make a difference?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …No, I don’t suppose it does. A beat. The two
men, far separated.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Do the angles. Find us a shot.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Security’s going to have the actual street
locked down. But there’s a residential street, perpendicular.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: High-end people. They’ll put up with a sweep,
but they’re not going to allow an agent to spend the day. They reach an
address. Bishop puts on a hat, some sunglasses, slaps a badge onto his
jacket that reads “DC Municipal Utilities.” He trots up the the
half-flight, rings the bell of an elegant brownstone.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Besides, the angle isn’t right, too flat.
Except when they hit the stairs. It’ll spread the group vertically.
It’s… the shot. Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence. Each
opens their bag, removes a series of innocuous objects, begins to
dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal. From a clock,
a firing mechanism. From the tube, an aluminum barrel holds a fishing
rod. The rod is discarded, the barrel is attached to a hard plastic
stock. AA Batteries are opened and slender shells are removed from each.
As this strange choreography continues in silence, we PAN ACROSS to the
dining room where a WOMAN and a MAN are bound and tied, pillowcases
cinched over their heads. Their bindings allow them to hold each other’s
hands which they do, tight. They’re terrified, but okay. Back in the
living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the home-made rifle, a
telescope, lifted from a child’s gift box, snaps it on top of the
rifle.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Look, I don’t care. Find her, I need to talk
to her right now…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You ever worry about the right and wrong of
it all? I’m not talking about God, just… Whatever you feel here.</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s p.o.v. through the scope</strong>: The US Attorney
building. The security detail. The steps leading to the street.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: It’s a little late for –</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Come on. You’re telling me you’ve never done
anything just because it was the right thing to do, even if it didn’t
make any sense? You never took a chance like that? Bishop pulls his eye
away from the scope a touch.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Once I did…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How’d that work out for you? Beat. Then
suddenly Bishop’s view is obscured by a large truck, which has stopped
trying to make the turn.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: We have a problem… Bishop moves the scope,
precisely looking for alternatives. Nothing. He sets the rifle down,
thinking as Steve takes in the new situation.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There’s no shot. What do we do? There’s no
shot.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Bishop…? And Bishop’s out.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: On your four. You see him? Coming up, a MAN
in a jogging suit stretches, touches his ear where’s he’s wired. Steve
and Bishop come abreast of him. WHAM! Steve pushes him down into the
garbage alley between two homes. WHAM! WHAM! The man drops. Steve comes
back, the man’s gun palmed. Offers it to Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: No. You’re the shooter.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: You’ll know when. WITH THEM, MOVING, taking
the corner onto the main street in front of the large building.</p>
<p>****: Hey… Listen, I need you to go out of town for a few days. No, I
know, but you have to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Just go – no, don’t tell me where. Just go,
okay. Okay? Yes, I’ll call you soon, I gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>i/e. government limo - continuous</strong>: Suddenly dropping
into Dean’s POV as his limo pulls up to the steps. Chaotic motion, LIGHT
STREAMING IN as the car door opens, security handlers reach in. We MOVE,
fast up steps lined by City POLICE. One of the police turning his head,
staring at Dean. Bishop. ON DEAN. Suddenly frozen. His handlers unsure
what’s going on, alert that something’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: …Bishop? Bishop does NOTHING. Security reads
Dean’s fear, closes on Bishop even as Dean himself starts to BACK AWAY,
separating himself from his own security, now turning to RUN… … Straight
into Steve, gun raised. A small moment frozen in time as Dean
understands his end… BANG BANG! - BANG! Steve double-taps Dean in the
chest, then one to head. And CHAOS begins its rule. Security which were
closing on Bishop now REVERSE, draw weapons and FIRE at Steve who drops
down in the small cement crease between stairs and statues. ON STEVE.
Ducked low, bullet shattering granite and marble around him, LAUGHING.
The first glimpse of something WRONG inside this young man.</p>
<p><strong>across the steps</strong>: Bishop, for the moment forgotten
by the security who have reversed to deal with Steve, suddenly ANIMATES.
Perfect timing, the security REVERSING again as Bishop draws his gun and
FIRES, over and over, clipping officers and security in the legs as he
SPRINTS down the steps towards…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Get in. Security are standing up, opening
up, as Steve DIVES forward.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Behind you. Steve has half a second to
puzzle this one as the Driver grabs him from behind, HAULS him
backwards. Bishop eyes his mirrors, counting the number of vehicles
pursuing. Eyes makes calculations, gets distracted for a moment from the
RAGING FISTFIGHT between Steve and the Driver occurring in the rear
compartment.</p>
<p><strong>in the rearview</strong>: Bishop watches a pursuit car
T-BONED by a truck, then his view is blocked by STEVE and the DRIVER as
they wrestle and fight. Over his initial surprise, the Driver’s trained,
and good. He locks Steve up, SLAMS him against the window, choking him.
UP AHEAD. Bishop sees a traffic jam LOOMING ahead, the limo closing at
100 mph, no alternatives. He lowers the divider.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Get in front.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Working on that…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Now! Bishop HAULS UP the E-Brake, putting
the Limo into a SPIN. The shift in force tosses Steve and Guard across
the rear space. Steve dives forward towards the front as…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We have got to go! Steve’s pointing at the
rear exit. It looks far away.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You go for it, I’ll cover you. Bishop takes
in the exit, the gun in Steve’s hand…</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: I’m sorry I brought you into this.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Not now, Bishop, we have to –</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: It was… It was the only thing I knew how to
teach you. Steve looks at him oddly, moved. Then…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Bishop. I brought
myself into this. Bishop considers this, nods. And he’s UP AND FIRING
towards the SWAT.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>with the cops</strong>: Firing. Bullets find exposed legs and
arms, men stumble back or fall to the ground, screaming.</p>
<p><strong>steve and bishop</strong>: Almost at the same exact moment,
the men switch their aim back to each other. Both men, controlling
emotion and body. Gasping for breath, bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: …Why?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You don’t know? Tense beat. Glimpsed through
shattered windows, SWAT arrives, takes the perimeter. They’re being
surrounded. Suddenly an SUV pulls into view between the restaurant and
the SWAT and Police position, a confused and frightened WOMAN at the
wheel. Police SHOUT at her, confusing her more. Steve makes a decision.
Lowers his weapon, grabs a napkin, ties it to hide his features.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Cover me. And with that Steve is RUNNING
towards the outside…</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s p.o.v.</strong>: The woman watches her car go, then
turns and sits on the pavement. Her hand moves to her chest, comes away
bloody. ON BISHOP. Angry like we’ve never seen him. Cold. Furious. The
stupid waste of it all. He meets the woman’s gaze. She dies looking at
him. Helicopters clatter above, bullets plink into dishware and
hardwood. Bishop just stares at the woman for a long beat, then he turns
away, back into the building. It is… over.</p>
<p><strong>us attorney</strong>: …Something is wrong in this country.
But today because of the actions of a few cowardly men, we may never
know the true face of – A voice announces boarding, drowning out the TV.
Bishop collects his things.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You know, when they came to me… I said “Are
you sure?” Bishop?” But They’re right, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: …You don’t really like the work anymore.
Bishop’s voice comes from the darkness near the barn.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Maybe not. BLAM! BLAM! Steve SHOOTS as
Bishop MOVES, finds cover.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah. That’s… what did you call it? That’s a
prerequisite.</p>
<p>****: Besides, I guess I had other reasons.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: If it matters, today we killed the man who
ordered the hit on your father.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, but not the man who actually killed
him. Steve advances, clearing the side of the barn, LINES his weapon on
Bishop, who’s standing next to the barn.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Why’d you kill those other people?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You really going moral high ground on me?
Seriously? You might want to check your soapbox there, partner.</p>
<p>****: But that’s the difference between us, isn’t it? You’re all
alone, but you still… like people. You wish they liked you. Whereas I
have people everywhere… and all I ever want, is to be alone. Steve hears
BANGING coming from the barn.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: There’s no weapons in there, Bishop! I’ve…
what did you teach me? I’ve controlled the situation. One hundred
percent. BOOM! The barn door blast outwards as Bishop’s vintage Mustang
come careening out of the barn at Steve… Who STANDS HIS GROUND. He aims,
fires five times through the windscreen. The rounds IMPACTING Bishop as
the car LOOMS at Steve who steps aside at the last moment, the car
barely missing him, continuing on and IMPACTING against the side of the
house… the propane tank. Steve squints and BOOOOOM! The propane tank
ERUPTS in flame. Steve is knocked back. When he rises, the interior of
the car is an inferno. The body is slumped against the wheel, the fire
consuming him, cleansing him. Steve. Bleeding, bruised, victorious.</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s voice</strong>: …Steve, if you hear this, then it
means you found the right moment to play the record. Good for you. It
also means you had to scratch the needle across the surface of the
record. Steve’s eyes LOCK on the record player, the needle scratching
across its surface, from the surface of the record, the smallest trace
of smoke…</p>
<p><strong>bishop’s voice</strong>: Sorry it has to end this way.
Steve’s eyes dart to the portrait of Bishop. Its cold eyes stare
back.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Every man has a death that’s right for them.
Every one. … where a form, a heat shadow, has burnt into the charred
remains of a shirt. A fist, middle-finger raised. We know this tattoo.
It was on the ex-con who tried to mug Bishop outside the bar. This is
not Bishop.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: A death so right that when it arrives, those
who knew him will say “Yes, this is right…”</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: “…This was always going to happen this way.”
Bishop gets out. Shaved, healthy, clean. He climbs onto the roof of the
car, stares at the highway which winds away into the distance. Freedom,
laid out before him. He stares at it, wanting, needing. He blinks.</p>
