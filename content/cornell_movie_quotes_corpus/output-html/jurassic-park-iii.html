<p><strong>ben</strong>: You make sure to get us as close as you can,
okay? If it’s a good trip, I’ll give you a little extra.</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Don’t worry. I take you close. But not too
close. You don’t want them to eat you.</p>
<p><strong>enrique</strong>: Ready, amigos?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ben!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Unclip your line!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
herbivores. They wouldn’t be interested in fighting each other. But
these… See, these are carnivores. And this one here – see its claws –
this one here uses its claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Uh, Alan?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He’s three. Why don’t you wait till he’s a
little older?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Oh, right. Happy dinosaurs.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That must be Mark. Mark, we�re back here!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Good day?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Keeping the world safe. Here, let me take
her.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Mark, this is Alan Grant.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Nice to meet you, Alan. I’ve heard a lot about
you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Daddy, this is a herbabore.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What’s my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
name Alan? Say my name.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: He used to know me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sorry, Alan it’s been six years.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: More coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. Great.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So, Mark’s working at the State Department
now.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Really? What do you do there?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I could tell you about it, but than I’d have
to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So what are you working on now?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Anything good?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Raptors, mostly.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: My favorite.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You remember the sounds they made?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I try not to.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We’ve done cranial scans, and raptors
actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory
that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence.
The way they can work together as a team.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You think they could talk to each other?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: To a degree we never imagined.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You taught him that.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Good luck with the fund raising.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to
see a real live dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Times change Alan. But you’re the still the
best. I mean that.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The last of my breed.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’d better get going.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Let me know if I can help, Alan. You�re bad
about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Goodbye, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: When I met you, I thought that one day
millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But
you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They
became other things. They evolved.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: A well-accepted theory.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Alan don’t be afraid to evolve.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It’s through the painstaking study of the
Interior chamber in multiple specimens that we can determine this
exciting correlation between the larynx and the upper plate. That lets
us theorize – theorize, mind you – that the raptor might have been
capable of bird- like vocalizations. Which as you can imagine, would be
a tremendous breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>sympostium leader</strong>: Thank you very much Dr. Grant.
Now does anyone have a question?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Does anyone have a question that doesn’t
relate to Jurassic Park?</p>
<p><strong>male student</strong>: Your theory on raptors is good and
all, but isn’t all this conjecture kind of moot?</p>
<p><strong>male student</strong>: I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica
and everyone decides how to handle the second island, scientist will
just go in and look for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>too-clever science reporter</strong>: Isn’t paleontology
itself in danger of extinction?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago. What’s left of them is
fossilized in stone the actual scientists spend years to undercover.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: what John Hammond and InGen created are theme
park monsters. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>another student</strong>: You’re saying you wouldn’t want to
study them if you had the chance?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: No force on this earth or in heaven could get
me on that island.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Udesky. Yes sir. we’re good to go. I’ll lock
it down as soon as you drop me the payment.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: That’s right, two of the very best I could
find. No, I haven’t worked with them personally, but they come with the
highest recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: You’ve got nothing to worry about, sir. This
is going to be a piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Billy? I don’t think I’m doing this
right.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You need to go slowly. See, just take it
little at a time.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: I can never tell what’s bone and what’s
rock.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Technically, it’s all rock. The calcium in
the bones is replaced during fossilization. But you can feel the
difference. See? Rough, smooth. Rough, smooth.</p>
<p><strong>cheryl</strong>: Rough.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dr. Grant!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Mr. Brennan.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How was your trip? Profitable?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We’ll be broke in four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Three weeks. I had to rent some
equipment.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You rented an automated litter box.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands
of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It’s
the future of paleontology.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Not if it can’t dig.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I give you a raptor’s resonating chamber.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They’re here.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Dr. Grant?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises My card.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I
have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my
wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You know, I’ve been traveling and I’m very
tired. Maybe some other time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I guarantee it’ll be worth your while.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It’s be my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: First off let me say as a dinosaur
enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: It is truly, what�s the word? Inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
Heck we’ve been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with:
Galapagos, K2, the Nile…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: We even have two seats reserved aboard the
first commercial moon flight.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we
wanted to do something really special, something…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: …once-in-a-lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ve arranged for a private airplane to take
us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I’m
afraid I’m much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of
highly qualified…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, no, see Dr. Grant, you’re the best. You’ve
seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’m flattered, but I’ve taken this little
adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they’ve imposed after the
incident in San Diego, you can�t fly low enough to see anything of
interest.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You see, that’s just the thing. Paul and I
have special permission to fly low.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How low?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, I’m no aviation specialist. But I do
know it’s hell of a lot lower than anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: From what I understand, it’s pretty much
whatever we want.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s just say that through my business –
imports/exports, emerging markets – I’ve made some friends in high
places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Dr. Grant, you don’t know how important it
is for us to have you come along. It would make all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>pual</strong>: And of course, we’re prepared to make a
sizeable contribution to your research here.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Even with what I pay you, you could get a
better bag.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some
buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft
sent me right into the side. BOOM!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That does sound lucky.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It was this strap alone that saved my life.
Got caught on a rock as I was falling.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
idiotic.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing
me along.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The bones will be there when we get back.
That’s the nice thing about them. They never run away. And besides, you
got me into this. I don’t intend to be alone with these people.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So how do you know the Kirby’s?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Through our church.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What Religion?</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Uh�the one that worships God and believes in
being Good.</p>
<p><strong>raptor</strong>: Alan.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Alan. We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are flying in restricted airspace.
Immediately turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat redirect
to…</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: No, I thought I’d keep it to myself.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
coloration.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m so use to seeing bones. It’s weird to see
skin.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
you can see…</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: South shore is clear. The rest is rock.</p>
<p><strong>nash</strong>: Are we on?</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: We’re on.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s not the landing gear?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What you’re… You can’t land.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Grant if you’d just sit tight, we’ll
explain this all in a jiffy.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: This plane can not land!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: It’s going to be all right. Just…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
Erriccc!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Tell me we didn’t land.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I think they’re looking for someone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Grant, are you alright? I’m sorry we had
to be so…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What the hell is going on? What are they
doing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
These guys are really good. One of them was a Green…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: And tell your wife to stop making so much
noise! We’re food to these damn animals.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it’s a bad
idea!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He says it’s a bad idea!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What’s a bad idea?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is it a rex?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sounds bigger.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: We gotta go, now!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s the problem? Can’t you guys…?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: We can’t just…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t worry, honey. We’ll circle around and
come back.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What about the other guy?</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Coop’s a professional. He can handle
himself.</p>
<p><strong>nash</strong>: We’re going!</p>
<p><strong>cooper</strong>: Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>nash</strong>: Coop, you know I can’t do it pal.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are you doing? That’s Mr. Cooper!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Oh, my God! Paul, my God!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is anyone hurt?</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Quiet! We’re okay. Let’s everybody just stay
put.</p>
<p><strong>nash</strong>: Who’s got the sat-phone?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Right here!</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: We’re sorry. All circuits are busy.
Please try your call again later…</p>
<p><strong>nash</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What is it? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Don’t worry. It’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Nobody move a muscle.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Why did you bring us here?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Our son is on this island. We need your help
to find him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is him. Eric. He�s thirteen now. He’s
just about the greatest kid in the world.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: He’s with a man named Ben Hildebrand.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Her new boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take
them parasailing. They never came back.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We called everyone, did everything we could.
Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in.
Costa Rica says it’s a no-fly zone, it’s their own damn fault. Guys at
the U.S Embassy – our U.S. Embassy – said we should “accept the
inevitable.” You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: So you hired these mercenaries.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: We prefer “recovery specialists.” We do
overseas custody issues and…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Then you duped us into coming here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
land. Somebody who’d been to this island before.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I have never been on this island!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sure you have. You wrote that book…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The
second island.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t know, there were two islands.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Still, you have survived the dinosaurs
before. You saved those kids.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
were better prepared and better armed. How many days have they been
missing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eight weeks.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: After what you’ve seen today, you really
think your son could be alive?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: He’s smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
about dinosaurs.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: No, I’m sorry, but no. We’ll savage what we
can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat
left, something to get us off this island.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Grant, we’re not leaving without our
son.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You can stick with us, or you can go and look
for him. Either way you’re probably not getting out of here alive.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Well, I think we should start searching for
your son. In the direction they’re going.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Nothing you haven’t seen before.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: How much weight have you lost?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I’ve been swimming
at the Y.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You hate to swim.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: People change.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You look good.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How would you classify it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Obviously a superpredator. Suchimimus. that
snout.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: They never got that big.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Baryonyx?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Not with that sail. Spinosaurus
Aegypticus.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t remember that on InGen’s list.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s because it wasn’t on their list. Who
knows what else they were up to?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the
top.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: About a thousand feet above it, actually.
Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and
Title Plus. We’re out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma.
The “plus” is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio
furniture. Stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t suppose that check you wrote us is
any good.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: He paid us half up front. Cash.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even the
store. and if we make it off this island with my son, I swear, I’ll make
good on the money I owe you. I don’t care if it takes me the rest of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: However long that is.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Eric!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
territory.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Well we should split up or something. We can
cover twice the area.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, Dr. Grant says…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says
that…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well what’s the use of hiring an expert if
your not going to listen to him?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Because “Dr. Grant” isn’t looking for Eric.
Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fine…and when the Tricyclatops comes after
you, don’t come crying to me.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Oh, don’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What did you say!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Just drop it Paul!</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: If they split up, I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Young adult.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Eric…</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Hey. Got something here.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: That’s Ben’s!</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Here, give that to me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It looks intact.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We should take it with us to signal any
planes.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: I think I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: It works!</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: I don’t know for how long.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s him. That�s Eric!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I filmed this the morning they left.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Ben!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Unclip the line!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hand on! Hang on buddy!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you ok, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I don’t know. I think so.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re okay. It’s going to be okay. Here, get
ready. I’m going to unhook you.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I’m all right</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re going to get out of this, pal.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: See? He’s okay. He’s alive! Everything’s going
to be all right now.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Amanda!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m sorry Amanda. I am. And I’m sorry for the
things I said about him.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: No, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know you liked Ben. I had no right to…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: It�s not about him. It’s Eric. He’s alone
out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
there’d be someone to keep him safe.</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: Dr. Grant!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Raptors.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What�s a raptor?</p>
<p><strong>udesky</strong>: They don’t look that big. I mean,
comparatively.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: If we came across one, we might live.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: But you never came across just one.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Wait! Where’s Billy?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I thought we weren’t suppose to yell.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I got some great pictures of the nest. You
know this proves raptors raised their young in colonies.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: This speaks to a larger social structure, the
possibility of Darwinian altruism. It changes everything.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We could co-write a paper.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
or perish.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I bet there’s a very good chance Eric’s in
there. I’d bet my bottom dollar.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eric! Are you here?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Eric!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s see. I’ve got about a dollar seventy-
five. How about you guys?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thank God for preservatives.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: This is how you make dinosaurs?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: This is how you play God.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay if I take pictures?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Amanda!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Back out! Move!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: In here!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Push!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: She’s calling for help.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Head for the trees!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Udesky.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: He’s this way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s not safe.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: We have to help him.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He’s right. A predator wouldn’t leave a kill
wounded.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: He’s not a kill, he’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They couldn�t climb up, so they were trying to
get us to come down.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They set a trap They actually set a trap.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where’s Grant?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What does that mean? What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: God damn you, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It means, “Give us the egg,” doesn’t it? “We
want the egg.”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Come on! They’ll be back!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Eric…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Eric, your parents are both here.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: In Costa Rica?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: On the island.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: They’ll never make it. I mean, they can’t
manage when the cable goes out.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’d be surprised what people can do when
they have too.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You’re Alan Grant, aren’t you? I read both of
your books.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Which one do you prefer?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The first one. Before you where on the island.
You liked dinosaurs back then.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Back then, they hadn’t tried to eat me.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
stuff behind.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Any weapons, radios?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Found this, but the battery’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It’s a wonder you aren’t. I’m amazed, Eric. I
barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Is that all it’s been? I thought it was
longer.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The important thing is we both made it.
That’s something we have in common.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Did you read Malcolm’s book?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on
himself.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: That’s two things we have in common.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: We can’t just stop looking. Eric and
Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I want to find them too, but we can’t do a bit
of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I’ll
bet there ten times more of ’em at night. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don�t know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I thought you were an expert.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dr. Grant was.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Well Dr. Grant isn’t here, so we’re going to
have to figure out what to do ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just want you know, Amanda. It’s not your
fault what happened.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well damn it. I don’t speak ill of the dead.
What I’m trying to say is, it�s was just a crazy accident. The exact
same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can’t go beating
yourself up about it.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: This wouldn’t happen if he was with you. I
mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars
in fives years.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That one time was just the bumper.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: He would have been, safe. Completely,
entirely, suffocatingly safe. I would have him to see more of the world
than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid,
Oklahoma. And so yes, it’s my fault that this happened. I’m sorry that
you have to be here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not sorry at all.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: A raptor claw. I use to have one. A
fossil.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Mine’s new.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How much of this island have you
explored?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured
if anyone came to look for me, that’s where they’d start.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We need to head for the coast.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Closer you get to the water, the bigger things
get.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
coast.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What about Eric and Dr. Grant?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Going to the coast was Alan’s idea. If he’s
alive, that�s where he’s headed.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What about Eric?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s probably has a better chance by the coast
as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of
the island. Right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My phone.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You had the phone the whole time?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t have it with me.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: When did you have it last?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t remember</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Think.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it
in my coat pocket, and…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What?…WHAT!?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
him when he…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Mon! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Sweetheart, you’re okay. You’re okay. You’re
okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we
stick around, huh?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Honey, there’s not enough spit in the world
for that.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We need to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Alan, I want to tell you that I’m so sorry
about the…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Billy, I can’t talk to you now.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed up because I know I
did.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I thought if we could get a raptor back to
the mainland, we could get serious money for it. Enough to fund the
digging for 10 years. More. Whatever it took.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You have to believe me. I did it with the
best intentions.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Some of the worst things imaginable have been
done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the
consequences, to yourself or anyone else. You’re no better than the
people who built this place.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We climb down to the barge and follow the
river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will
pick us up.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Then we go home?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Then we go home.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: How about if we try this way?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Do you think it goes all the way across?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: One way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We’d better do this one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Grant?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Come on over. One at a time.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Eric, its okay. You’ll be right behind
me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’re not going anywhere, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Okay! Come on, Eric!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: How ’bout if I…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No, I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s it Eric. Nice and easy…</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: A bird cage.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Eric!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It won’t hold!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m trying! That thing took him down this
way!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Split up!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hang on, Eric!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: He made it!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Billy, look out!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get back! Get back!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Billy!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s no use, Dr. Grant. No use.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My own kid was right in front of me and I
didn’t do a damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You couldn’t have made that jump.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I should have tried. It should have been me on
that beach back there, not Billy.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: How would you have helped Eric? He needs
you, Paul. He needs us.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He could have died.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: But he didn’t. And neither did you. And I’m
glad about that.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Do you have any kids?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: No. Although I’ve studied them in the
wild.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I have a theory that there’s two kinds of
boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be
astronauts.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I want to be an astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: See, I was the opposite. I never understood
why anyone would want to go into space. It’s so dangerous. You do one
thing wrong and you’re dead. The astronomer – or the paleontologist –
get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And
truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: But then you never get to go in space.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Exactly. The difference between imagining how
things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch
them. That’s what Billy wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Keep quiet.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Find it before it stops ringing!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve got something. I think I’ve got
something!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I’ve got it! I’ve got it!</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: You too can own a time share in
beautiful Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four star restaurants,
explore our coral reefs, or just walk on the beach…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Can’t help but be a little offended.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Whatever you do, don’t call the U.S. Embassy.
They won’t do a God Damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, we don’t exactly have a Costa Rican
phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states.
Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Stan.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I wouldn’t trust Stan with a snowball in a
blizzard.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Bonitas.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Something must’ve scared them.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Get the motor going.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Who are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Pick up! Pick up!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hewwo?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
away!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Charlie? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hewwo?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Charlie! It’s the dinosaur man! Go get mommy,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Was somebody on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Dinosaur man.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Alan?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Alan? Alan!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Raaaar!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Up! Up!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Where’s Dad?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Just hold on.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Jump! Swim for the far shore!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We have to keep looking for Dad. We have
to.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I know. I know. I want to look for him
too.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: then we should…</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
okay? He’s very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever
very much.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He loves you too.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that
we’re safe. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: We’re going to get out of this, and
everything’s going to be all right, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Listen to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good thing I’ve been swimming, huh?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You remember when we went fishing last summer?
And I was trying to put the boat in and the trailer sank? And then the
tow truck came and tried to pull it out, but it got dragged in? And the
truck driver threatened to knock your Dad’s lights out? So I said I was
the governor and he believed me?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That was a fun day.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: We should try fishing again.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You mean it?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I do. It’s worth another shot. And who
knows? Things might turn out differently.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: The lady you called, how do you know she can
help us?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: She’s the one person I could always count on.
And she’s saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her
everything.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It’s strikes me now I never told her
that.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: You should.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
that brought you here? Why did it crash?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: No. I couldn’t see.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
minute, would you? They look worried.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Mom! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Helicopters. Helicopters!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: We’re safe!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: No we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: You have to go back! We can’t leave him!</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: They’re not following.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: We have to cut it! Find something sharp!</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: What do you think is going to happen with the
dinosaurs?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: The population will Stabilize eventually.
They’ll adapt to fit different roles.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Either that, or the government will firebomb
it back to the Stone Age.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I would completely support that.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I hope they don’t. I want to come back
someday.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: So do I.</p>
