<p><strong>mr. rodman</strong>: This informant, paid by the police,
using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit, was the link
which allowed police to raid a private farm. A working farm. A farm
where honest Americans make their living.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rodman</strong>: The government, in its haste, has
employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is, at best,
questionable –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Mr. Rodman…it’s too bad your client didn’t
show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his
attorney…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Lately the only variation I’m hearing in
your argument is the name of the client. And you can sit there all day
arguing the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates, but you aren’t going to
convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous
informants. Furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property
rights in the United Sates. When you make the decision to have marijuana
on your farm, whether it’s one joint or an acre of plants, your property
can be seized and your property can be sold.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rodman</strong>: I’m sorry the court finds my argument
repetitious.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of advice?
The next time you argue this point before this court, regardless of my
whereabouts, I recommend you have something up your sleeve other than
your arm.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Depends who it’s from.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Your friends at Warren, Putnam and
Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You can learn a lot about somebody from this
stuff. Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something
from me. Definitely third category.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What would a law firm want from the new drug
Czar?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Depends on the state.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Medicinal marijuana initiative. Or am I
being cynical?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Maybe there’s a book in it.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Not by me.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I had that dream again.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Where my mother’s suffocating.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: No. There’s no problem.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Okay. I see. How much do you want?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You want more than this?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You want something else?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Drop the package. Put your hands behind your
head. You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I don’t understand. I think there must be
some mistake.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: No, there’s no mistake.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Javier Rodriguez.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Well, Javier Rodriguez, you’ve done a very
good job, but we’ll take care of it from here.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: We’ve been following these Narco-
trafficantes for some time but had not been able to bring them to
justice. Put the prisoners in the car. Impound the truck.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: One question. How did you find about
this?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: An informant.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: What is the name of your informant?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: It was an anonymous tip.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: For a State Police officer, you’re very
well informed. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>moments later</strong>: Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of
vehicles drive away.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Wasn’t that General Salazar?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: What’s he doing up here?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I don’t know. Something.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: No telltales. Nothing to read. Not touching
my face. Not even blinking. No giveaways. How’re you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I feel good.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: No more pissant basin league bullshit for
us, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep it all
together. Take this motherfucker down.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Showtime.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen. We’re
looking for Eduardo Ruiz. We have a two o’clock appointment.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You ever buy a quarter ton? Not many people
have.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: So, it’s worth the wait, right? What can I do?
Rent a Huey? Have an airlift? It’s not like you can put it in a condom
up some mule’s asshole, right? How many peasants would that take? A line
stretching from here to Mexico City –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Nobody said shit, Eduardo –</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Relax. We’re waiting, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Hey, you want to hear a joke? I got a joke.
Why do women wear makeup and perfume?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Chill out –</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: It’s a funny fuckin’ joke and it’s quick.
Why do women wear makeup and perfume?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: ’Cause they’re ugly and they stink.</p>
<p><strong>on fuzzy surveillance video</strong>: Castro laughing. Ruiz
politely smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Man, you never been close enough to a woman
to know how she smells.</p>
<p><strong>dea agent</strong>: What’s his hand doing? Watch his hand.
Anybody? I don’t like the hand.</p>
<p><strong>dea agent</strong>: This is ridiculous this fucking thing.
Look at this shit – the first television transmission. I had better shit
when I was the AV guy at junior high, swear-to-God.</p>
<p><strong>another dea agent</strong>: Come on, Castro, pay attention.
Watch his damn hands.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: All right, here we go. The blue
van.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: Three unmarked vehicles. Three
unmarked vehicles accompanying.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: It’s local. Local or Customs. Oh, man,
I don’t know. Looks like the cavalry.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: This is our show. Ah, man. I don’t want
to share this one.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Agent down. Repeat, agent down.</p>
<p><strong>clown</strong>: Hey dudes, we’re not open yet.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Take me to the hospital. I’m bleeding to
death.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Father of Greek tragedy? Anyone? Okay,
Aeschylus it is. His trilogy? The Oresteia. I mean this is beautiful,
can anyone stop the Seth Machine? Score. Thank you. Madmax from Omaha we
own you. And Tragedy is closed out.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Entertainment. The Susan Lucci section or
Banal Love Songs of the Nineties?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Banal Love Songs it is. Hey, you wanna try
something?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Just watch.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Inhale the smoke and hold it.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What is this, like freebase?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Not like. It is.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Go… Go!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: See… Now, you see.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Until you officially take over the
office of National Drug Control Policy, under no circumstances should
you speak to the press unprotected, without going through this office or
having someone in the room. There are a lot of interests in this town
and, right now, they’re all scared of you. The reason they’re scared of
you…technically, you have veto power over their budgets. So think about
that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio Shack
and the DMV, they’re all gonna want to speak to you. And that’s the good
news… You’ll also be meeting Senators and Congressman, each with a
specially prepared question. Their question is designed for one thing:
to make them look smart. If you lecture them, they won’t think you
respect them. If you respond with utter humility, they will. Remember,
this is about your respect for them, and the President’s respect for
them. Speaking of which, as soon as he gets back from Russia and China,
we’ll get you in there for some face- time, let the two of you catch up.
It’d probably be a good idea for you to meet your predecessor. I’ll have
Jeff Sheridan take you over. Also, four weeks from today you will give
your first official press conference. In it you will outline the
President’s strategy for winning the war on drugs. Okay, anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’ll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p><strong>sheridan</strong>: I just want to be clear about one thing. I
used to work for him, but now I work for you. I’m not a partisan person,
I’m an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we’ll get
you well-versed on an incredible array of issues. The most important of
which, in my opinion, being Mexico. I know everybody that you’re gonna
meet. It’s important that they like you. It’s not important that they
like me. That’s why I can help protect you.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Like you protected Landry?</p>
<p><strong>sheridan</strong>: I see where you’re going with that, but if
I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is
so autocratic he doesn’t know how to let himself be helped; it’s a point
of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was
even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating. Now,
don’t get me wrong, he’s a man of enormous integrity, but there’s a
political component to this job that the General just didn’t have any
patience for.</p>
<p><strong>general landry</strong>: Jeff, you want to excuse us for a
minute?</p>
<p><strong>general landry</strong>: Functionaries. Nice people, the
Schedule C’s. About twelve graduate degrees apiece, but it seems
sometimes all they do is start rumors.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’ve done a fine job here, Sir. The Office
of National Drug Control Policy is in better shape than when you found
it.</p>
<p><strong>general landry</strong>: I’m not sure I made the slightest
difference. I tried… I really did.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: There are a lot of encouraging statistics.
The work’s just started, but I intend to see it through. You’ve got my
word on that.</p>
<p><strong>general landry</strong>: You’re here for two years, three
maximum. What’d they promise you? Court appointment? What? District?
Appeals? Not Supreme… Supreme?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’ve come in to do a tough job and that’s
what I’m going to focus on.</p>
<p><strong>general landry</strong>: When Kruschev was forced out, he sat
down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor. He said
“When you get into a situation you can’t get out of, open the first
letter and you’ll be saved. And when you get into another situation you
can’t get out of, open the second.” Soon enough this guy found himself
in a tight place. So he opened the first letter. It said, “Blame
everything on me.” So he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm.
He got into another situation he couldn’t get out of, so he opened the
second letter, which read, “Sit down and write two letters.”</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Relax. If they were going to kill us they
would have done it in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: They wouldn’t do it in front of all these
people. They’d send someone later, when we’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Away from the car. Now!</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Even if that were true, they’re not going to
come to your house where you’re waiting for them.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’s right. They’ll do it when you’re walking
somewhere, make it look like street crime.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Shut your fucking mouth. Nobody’s talking to
you.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: If you want her to stay out of it, then stop
telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: She’s nosy. She hears me on the
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Anyway, I don’t think we’ll ever see them
again. Everything’s back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>tourist woman</strong>: You’re a police officer. Aren’t you
going to take a report or something? Don’t you want to know what kind of
car it is?</p>
<p><strong>tourist man</strong>: It’s a Brown Ford Explorer –</p>
<p><strong>tourist woman</strong>: It was right here. It’s been stolen.
I want to file a report.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Please. Filing a report will not help you
find your car.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: The police won’t find your car.</p>
<p><strong>tourist woman</strong>: But you’re the police.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Call this man, he’ll find your car for
you.</p>
<p><strong>tourist man</strong>: I don’t get it –</p>
<p><strong>tourist woman</strong>: How will this guy know who has our
car?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: The police will tell him.</p>
<p><strong>tourist man</strong>: Why will they tell him but they won’t
tell us?</p>
<p><strong>tourist woman</strong>: Because we pay him, stupid. Right?
And he pays the police.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Yes. Better than filling out forms,
right?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Javier Rodriguez.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Duck salad?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Helena, you never order duck salad.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Well, that’s true. I don’t. I think someone
else is asking for it.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Well, he’s got good taste. Isn’t it the most
wonderful thing you ever tasted? I mean ever.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: It’s delicious –</p>
<p><strong>stewie</strong>: They’re the most marvelous little creatures.
Canard. They fly, swim, walk. And so cute with their babies marching
along behind.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Looking for a nice sauce ala orange.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s a very fatty bird. All that winter
insulation. Just like me.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: You mean all breast, just like you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re bad –</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Jealous, that’s all –</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’ve heard… I can’t remember where… That
it’s full of that good kind of fat, the kind you’re supposed to eat
–</p>
<p><strong>stewie</strong>: Unsaturated fat –</p>
<p><strong>two women in unison</strong>: Polyunsaturated.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: And now there’s a good cholesterol and bad
cholesterol. Everything they tell you completely changes every other
week. I don’t know why they think we should listen at all.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: What I know is ducks, as cute as they are, were
designed by God to be eaten.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’ll put this in the back.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: All the professionals keep them in the
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Not Tiger Woods.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Especially Tiger Woods. …Actually, he keeps
his on the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos. I sell to all those
guys. Why? Because the technology to intrude has reached the masses.
Your competitor, your ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers, they’re at the
local electronics store right now, and they’re gonna be intruding on you
not only through your telephone, but your fax, cell phone, pager, cable
TV, Musak, windows, walls, air conditioning ventilation, modem, and
internet connection.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Nobody has these babies, no way, not the
shiznit.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I want to intercept cell phone calls,
digital and analog. And locate the source of the call. I need databasing
capability, to cross-reference calls and numbers.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Your Cellular Secretary, friend across all
the digital wireless spread spectrum. So, Francisco, what do you do? You
a PI? Private security?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Assassin.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Assassin, okay. Let’s get you started in
surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>pharmaceutical lobbyist</strong>: We in the legal drug
business, and I mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my very powerful
clients, realize this isn’t a war with a traditional winner and loser,
but an organism at war with itself, whose weapons of mass destruction
happen to be intoxicants. And if you want a body count look no further
than alcohol which racks up 80,000 kills a year. Cocaine manages a
measly 2,000. Same for Heroin. But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco which
kills 380,000 each year, which, by the way, is more people than have
been killed by all the illegal drugs in the last century.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That’s very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: It’s time, Robert, to choke some honesty out
of these rural legislators; get’em to fess up that it’s pretty much
Prisons or Casinos in terms of their choices for economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What’s the difference between Prozac and
Ecstacy, you ask? One’s a mattress and the other’s a trampoline.
Molecules don’t have morality. Really, think about it: some molecule
changes the way a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor works, it’s not suddenly
a bad molecule; it’s just a molecule. My theory: America has a real fear
of short, intense experiences.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Like you.</p>
<p><strong>another room</strong>: Robert at the bar getting another
scotch. A secretive man, TIM, 40’s, nerdy, sidles up beside him and
whispers furtively in his ear.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Chemicals? Some say problems, others say
solution. Imagine a cloud that when it rains prohibits the growth of
poppies or takes the THC out of marijuana. Imagine a pill that
eliminates any psychological craving, from Dilaudid to Dove Bars. Law
enforcement hasn’t let science sit on the sidelines. Addiction is no
more relevant than polio or the Black Plague.</p>
<p><strong>economist</strong>: You’re not battling traffickers or
dealers, but a market, and the market contains a paradox: if you arrest
traffickers, you raise prices, and you also raise profits, which brings
more traffickers into the business.</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: Back in the real world, we’re
talking about Mexico and not John Maynard Keynes. We will spend 18
billion dollars this year on this “war,” and the question on the table
every year is do we certify Mexico as an ally or not?</p>
<p><strong>rush phillips</strong>: You want to make a difference, hit
the users. You don’t jeopardize our financial markets by some
hypocritical stance on drug consumption. We’re snorting it, why penalize
Mexico for supplying it?</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: Mexico, don’t talk to me about
Mexico –</p>
<p><strong>economist</strong>: It’s the stick of law enforcement that
creates the carrot of huge profits… That’s economic truth –</p>
<p><strong>rush phillips</strong>: Addicts don’t vote; they don’t have
PACs; they don’t spend soft money, that’s political truth –</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: We’re locking them up and
consumption is falling –</p>
<p><strong>economist</strong>: The price of coke and heroin has dropped
and purity has increased. All this law enforcement has achieved is kids
can get better stuff, cheaper. In economic terms, you can forget it;
this is not a winnable war.</p>
<p><strong>rush phillips</strong>: Christ, you want to decertify
somebody, take Pakistan or Columbia. We don’t need them for
anything.</p>
<p><strong>economist</strong>: If you manage to seize an inconceivable
50 percent of all drugs coming into this country, you’ll still raise the
price of coke and heroin less than 3 percent which won’t affect drug use
at all.</p>
<p><strong>rush phillips</strong>: Why are we calling this a war at all?
You don’t declare war on your own people. Addiction is a little worm
that gnaws a house apart from the inside.</p>
<p><strong>undersecretary</strong>: We need Mexico for these reasons:
number one – Defense; two – Trade; three – Tourism; then, way on down
the line, comes Drugs. The President knows this. Why’s he holding
everybody’s feet to the fire?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mr. Wakefield, there’s a situation that
needs your attention right away.</p>
<p><strong>rush phillips</strong>: One in sixteen Americans is of
Mexican descent. Mexico our third largest trading partner…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’re looking pretty good for an old
guy.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My work keeps me young.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail
or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The worst serial killer in history - who?
Gacy - right? Killed forty two people. Our government killed fifty
thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Michael, you represent drug dealers, not
civil libertarians.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that
covered in your Constitution? Because it isn’t in mine.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Noriega is a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who
made the mistake of doing business with the U.S. Government. So, no, I
don’t have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government,
fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit
honest.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Last I read your clients were chopping
people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this
country.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I hope when you were on the bench, Judge
Wakefield, you didn’t handle the presumption of innocence in the same
fashion.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: If I ever return to the bench, Counselor
Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?
You don’t like it here? This is the best situation you’re going to have
for a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: I am a legitimate business. Fishing boats.
Tuna. Check it out. Tax records, everything –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill
me with a fucking cannon.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You can’t visit me here. I want my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: The amount of coke we got on you means
capital punishment in some states.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Move ’em to Texas, fry ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We got you on tape making the deal. We got
you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.
We got you.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: One chance here, Eduardo. Make us believe
you got a boss. No boss, it’s all on you.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: It’s a death sentence. I’ll never make it to
the trial.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We can protect you.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Who do you work for?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: This is coercion.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That’s a big word for a fisherman.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Who do you work for?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: I know another word… Immunity.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hello. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry, Jonas. I don’t care if that is the
price you have gotten in order countries.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This is America, a different country. I am
Carl, a different man. So you see, everything about our situation is
different and I believe the pricing will be different, too. You’re a
reasonable man… So take the weekend to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Every day with this guy is like starting all
over again.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Just watching you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I got that. How was your day?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I keep feeling like I’m forgetting
something.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: David, come inside –</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What is this? What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Mr. Ayala?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You’re under arrest for violation of Federal
Narcotics laws.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We have a warrant to search your home,
Mrs. Ayala.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Not you. You.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Javier Rodriguez. Twenty-nine years- old.
Graduated from Montessori school. Five years as a beat cop in TJ. Three
years with the State Police. Parents died four years ago in their
apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning because they could not afford
to fix their gas heater. Your sister works in a Maquiladora in Juarez,
making designer blue-jeans. On the police force three years, you
currently make 316 dollars a month.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: That’s your past. I want to talk about your
future. Would you be willing to do something for me?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: If I can.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: I’m trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: What is it you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: A small thing. Nothing really.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Does this offer include my partner?</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Only if he can be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: He’ll do what I say.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: His name is Francisco Flores. He is a
killer and gun smuggler for the Tijuana cartel. I need to speak with
him. I need you to find him and bring him to me so that I can speak with
him.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: This is fucking crazy. Instead of killing
us, he sends us on a suicide mission. Do you know who Frankie Flowers
is? He’s a psycho-cokehead- hitman. A faggot. He’s killed fucking who
knows how many people. You’d need half the force to get close to him.
And you can’t get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Then I guess I’m going by myself.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What’s it like? Imagine you’re being
accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the
beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don’t say “please” or “thank
you.”</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What about legalizing everything? Has
anybody talked about that?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Fine – legalization. Okay, forgetting all of
our international trade agreements, legalize everything today. The
Government inserts itself into all drug transactions. The U.S. becomes a
giant pharmacy. Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to
Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Like a Grateful Dead Concert.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Drugs begin pouring out of America into
every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: What if every country legalized at the
same time?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Somehow, I don’t see that happening.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: So you know we put the case before the
arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise. Superfund is just one
of those words. People stop paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That’s frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s so frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Did you meet the President?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Honey, your father knows the President.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: As it happens, the President of the United
States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in
for some “face time”.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Will we get invited to the White
House?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: How long’s the job?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s a presidential appointment so… until I
quit or get fired.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Czar for life, just like a real czar.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: That makes mom the Czarina. I’m a
Czarette. Like Anastasia.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: None of my friends can fucking believe my
dad is the actual Drug Czar.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Caroline –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Sorry, but I mean, come on.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It’s great, daddy. It’s just amazing,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Helena, I’m so sorry –</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Arnie, thank God.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Can you please tell me what on earth is
going on?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I understand. You’re upset. You want to know
what’s going on. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Why are you talking like that?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Listen to me carefully. First of all, Carl
isn’t here. DEA’s got him and they’ll hang on to him until arraignment,
which will probably be tomorrow. So here you’re wasting your time. Are
you with me?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Good. From now on I want you to expect that
every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your
lips is being read. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Arnie, this is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Got it? Good. Do not discuss anything over
the telephone. Do not talk to the neighbors. Stay out of your yard.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: What is he being charged with?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I don’t know, but under no circumstances
would I talk about it here. I want you to go home and relax the best you
can. Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very
important.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through
the looking glass.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: That’s a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go
home and be with your children.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Javi is working on his second beer when he
seems to recognize somebody.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: I’m curious how you did this with such
economy.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Everybody has a weakness.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: All I’m saying, what I’m saying, is it
never seems like anybody ever says anything that matters to them, like
we all look at each other and nod with responses we’ve been trained to
make, not real responses, just social conventions, phony, fake smiles,
surface bullshit… I mean, we’re all smart and do we have any idea what
each other are like, really like? Do I know what Seth’s afraid of, or
Vanessa, or fucked-up Bowman?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: …Probably, but do I ever say this stuff,
just say, “hey, I’m uncomfortable in this crowd, I don’t know what the
fuck I’m doing, either? I know you’re afraid and it’s okay–”</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We act like we have all the answers and we’re
totally invincible like our parents seem and their parents before them
and it’s fucking bullshit –</p>
<p><strong>fucked-up bowman</strong>: For instance –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: For instance I know you jack-off thinking
about Caroline even though you’re supposedly “in love” with Vanessa.
Whatever the fuck that means? I mean, what is that convention, anyway?
We’re all these random collections of self-interest, and then we just
decide that now we’re two people walking along –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: And Vanessa doesn’t think she’s pretty so
she does all these weird fucking diets which is totally about self-
esteem. And she’s beautiful. And that’s not even fair. Because listen to
me. I’m fucking lying right now. This is exactly what I’m talking about…
I’m supposedly talking about you, making some big point about you, and
it’s really about me. So I should talk about me, not you, not even the
universal “you…” Okay. Okay, I’m worried I’m not really smart or that
I’m not nearly as smart as people think I am, or that my parents’
expectations have been way too high since I was five, I mean who knows
they’re going to Harvard when they’re five, not that I’m blaming them
for anything because everything’s great, and I may not even get in, but
we all feel this shit and we never acknowledge it and if we can’t
acknowledge it to the people we care the most about then who will we
ever say it too and what kind of life will that be?</p>
<p><strong>fucked-up bowman</strong>: I jack-off thinking about Seth.
Everybody I know does.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Ach, that’s what I’m talking about.
Sarcasm. Always fucking sarcasm. You’re afraid and you think if you
admit it people will think you’re weak or won’t like you –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We live our lives by these unspoken rules that
are handed to us.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Let’s be different –</p>
<p><strong>fucked-up bowman</strong>: I can’t feel my hands.</p>
<p><strong>fucked-up bowman</strong>: I’m serious –</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: He’s blue. He isn’t breathing –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Is he breathing?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What do we do? Okay. Fucked-up Bowman’s
turning blue. Doctor. We need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Your dad’s a doctor. Call him –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He’s a research doctor. You’re dad’s a doctor,
too –</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What kind of research?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Mapping the fucking pig genome. We’ll call
your dad, he’s a neurosurgeon –</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: It’s three a.m. I’m not supposed to be
here. I snuck out –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Are you kidding… I’m staying with you
–</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He’s gonna fucking die right here on the
kitchen floor –</p>
<p><strong>another kid</strong>: He can’t. My parents are in Barbados
–</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Nobody has anything on them, right?</p>
<p><strong>torturer</strong>: We know Tijuana Cartel gunmen killed our
chief of intelligence, Francisco. We know you killed police commanders
in Tijuana and Mexico City. Why do you resist?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: My father is rich. He’ll pay you.</p>
<p><strong>torturer</strong>: Not the correct answer, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>torturer</strong>: We know that you went after the neighbor
of General Salazar, a simple alfalfa farmer. His grand-daughter was
shot. This is stupid behavior, Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>stewie</strong>: This is fabulous, Helena. What a
turnout.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Thank you so much, but I had a lot of
help.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: It’s a turnout because it’s a spectacle. Can
you imagine?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I’ve met her husband, as nice as they
come.</p>
<p><strong>stewie</strong>: It teaches me a valuable lesson… Apparently
crime pays.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Silly, you knew that already.</p>
<p><strong>tuxedo</strong>: Hello. Thank you. Thank you all. I have the
results of the silent auction…</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: …How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Sixteen</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Live with your parents?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Parents still together?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Do you work?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I volunteer. I read to blind people. One
day a week for two hours.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: In school?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Cincinnati Country Day.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: Private?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: How are your grades?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’m third in my class.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I get A’s. All A’s.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: You do? What else you do?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’m a National Merit Finalist. I’m on the
Hi-Q team and the Math team. I’m in the Spanish Club. I’m a Thespian.
I’m Vice-President of my class. I’m on the volleyball team.</p>
<p><strong>social worker</strong>: You wanna tell me what you’re doing
here, Caroline?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, honey. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Did you tell Dad?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Are you going to?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Is this bad for him?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I am on the board of my son’s school. I had
a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard. I have a right to know if my
husband is a legitimate businessman.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Of course he is. I’ve known him for twenty
years and he doesn’t jaywalk…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: …Carl is a very important member of this
community and when we’re through suing the police and the district
attorney and the DEA, they’ll have to rename the public parks for your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Your husband is very good at his job…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Which is smuggling illegal drugs into this
country.</p>
<p><strong>gordon’s pov</strong>: the blinds covering Helena’s study
glowing peacefully.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: They’re whispering. I can’t hear them, but I
know it. I smell conspiracy. I feel the lie vibrating out of the
home.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: She ain’t in on it.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: I have dreams about this, actual dreams
about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m telling you, she doesn’t know shit.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: She knows Arnie Metzger.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: So does half of San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: You want to make a wager on this?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: If all our assets are frozen and our “sales
force” has scattered… How am I supposed to survive? I’m giving birth in
three months. How do I get through this?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: You’re gonna get through it, but the first
thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl. We get Adler and we
beat this thing.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: How much do I pay him?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I suspect he’ll accept his payment in
publicity.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Caroline? How well did you know this boy who
overdosed?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: He didn’t hang around us. He’s like one of
those hippie kids. I’m not part of that group. It was a party in all
these rooms. His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical…
He’s blue, he’s puking… We didn’t want to get in trouble, but what were
we supposed to do? I mean, what would you have done if you had been
us?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: How well do you know this boy, Seth, who
was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and
possession of marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: He’s a friend. He’s also like the only one
who was dealing with the situation. He’d definitely had a few beers, but
it’s not like he wanted to drive. We didn’t know what else to do. It
wasn’t my pot.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Okay, honey. We understand. You’re mother
and I have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Honey, we’d like to talk alone.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Like always.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I think she’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: We’ll ground her, clip her wings a bit.
School and scheduled activities and that’s it until further notice. This
has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney’s
office, will probably help us out, quietly. Christ, this could be
embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Honey, this is difficult, but we’ve all had
our moments. I tried –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Stop. You experimented in college. I don’t
want to hear about that.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Should we take the quotes off experiment
and call it what it is?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: This is different.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: To begin with, she’s only sixteen
years-old.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I think she has to find out for herself, on
her own. We have to allow her space –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Space for what? To O.D. like that other kid?
I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her
parents. Because it isn’t. Correct?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We don’t want to push her away. These are
growing experiences.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How long have you known about this?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How long have you known?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Six months. I found some marijuana, that’s
all. And a little pipe about two inches long. I talked with her. She
said her friends smoked pot and drank –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Explain to me how you could think that I
shouldn’t know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn’t be relevant
to me. As a parent.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: She asked me not to.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: You watch and learn. I earn his trust. Then
more pain. Then I appear with kindness. Within a week he will follow me
around like a dog.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: But will he be house-trained?</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: When he loves me like a father, he will
never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his
superiors. Then we get them and they too will give us names. And
eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will
fall.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: This is shameful. A disgrace. Francisco
Flores –</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: It’s all right, son. It’s all right.
Salazar is here. You’re among gentlemen, now. This shameful treatment
will stop immediately. Guard!</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: I want to know who is responsible for this
treatment.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: We aren’t barbarians.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Bring this man a change of good clothes.
Has he eaten?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: You will dine with me from now on.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: This is a man who heads a large criminal
organization with international contacts we can only begin to
understand. Our case against him is very strong. He is not a flight
risk. His flight is assured. The people ask that your honor denies
bail.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: My client is no more a flight risk than your
Honor or the able prosecutor. He is a pillar of his community, a family
man with a wife and child in La Jolla, the community where he has made
his home for over twenty years. As our defense will quickly show, my
client is guilty of nothing more than being a handy target for an
admitted criminal. Therefore we ask that you release Carl Ayala on his
own recognizance.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m gonna deny bail.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mrs. Ayala, were you aware your husband is
the largest cocaine smuggler in America?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Alleged, people, alleged.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Mrs. Ayala is it true your husband has
ordered a hit on Eduardo Ruiz?</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Carl Ayala sits on the board of the
Children’s Hospital. He is heavily involved with Adult Literacy. He has
a small boy and another child on the way. If you spread this kind of
innuendo, you can expect legal recourse. Are we clear on this point?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I appreciate you coming in so early.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.a. kelly</strong>: Judge Wakefield, it’s an honor to
handle it for you. Consider it gone away. She’s a minor; it probably
would’ve expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and
I wanted to thank you personally.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.a. kelly</strong>: Like I said, open container, P.I.,
Misdemeanor possession. Easy to make it disappear. For you, poof, it’s
gone.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.a. kelly</strong>: One thing bothers me… That kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him. Serious amounts. He’s lucky he
lived. So I gotta ask: what’s your daughter on?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.a. kelly</strong>: I mean, did you ask her? What kind of
drugs has she tried?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I… I don’t really know.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.a. kelly</strong>: Is she in any kind of therapy…
professional help?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, of course not. She’s one of the top
students at her school.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.a. kelly</strong>: Well, I hope it stays that way.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: It’s Robert. Wipe your schedule clean for
the next three days. I’m tired of talking to experts who never set foot
outside the beltway. It’s time to see the front lines.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You should see little Montel play. Little
Montel is the next Maradona.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Maradona is a cokehead. Hand of God, my ass.
We’re wasting our time here.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He won. He was a winner. That bothers
you.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Winners don’t do coke. Or haven’t you been
reading the bumper stickers?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What do we have here?</p>
<p><strong>on the monitor:</strong>: David kicking a soccer ball with an
older strange man, TIGRILLO, Latino, 40’s, fit and tough looking.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: David, come back here this minute.
David!</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: David –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re playing!</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Yeah, this is fun.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Please put down my son.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Shouldn’t let your kid wander off with
strangers.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Thank you. That’s a valuable lesson. David,
come on.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Mrs. Ayala –</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Your husband owes a lot of money.
Enough that snapping this kid’s neck wouldn’t nearly cover it.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is going to disappear, and he won’t turn up until the
evening news.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: You get exactly one warning.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: The first payment is three million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Are you getting this on tape?</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: I love my job. I love it. The next time I’m
having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I’ll get over
it.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: A group of us are going out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Guzman, Tomas, Esteban –</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Your new friends.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Not this time.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: In my home I have B&amp;W speakers. I
recently purchased a compact disc burner. I can make my own cd’s, with
whatever music I like, as if I bought them at the store, only I don’t
have to pay these crazy prices.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: We have much in common. We both attended
school in the United States, and both of our fathers are engineers.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I got into stereo equipment when I was a
kid. Some people don’t notice the difference but it is very important to
me.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Of course it is. Have some more wine.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Now, Francisco, my friend… I must know
where these men are who killed my captains. Not where they were last
week, but where they are today, and better still, tomorrow. You are
clever. You can predict where they will be, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I can’t go home. I don’t want to go.
Please don’t make me.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: It’s not our decision.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I’ll be killed.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Stop complaining. Nobody knows what you’ve
been up to.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family
connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of
Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of
the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society
and using his fishing boats.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: So you pay off our customs officials?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: In Mexico law enforcement is an
entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA. Using
regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border
and calculated the odds of a search. The odds are not high, and we found
variables that reduce the odds. We hire drivers with nothing to lose.
Then we throw a lot of product at the problem. Some get stopped. Enough
get through. It’s not difficult.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: You’d think he wasn’t sitting here facing
life in prison.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: This has worked for years and it will continue
to work for years. NAFTA makes everything more difficult for you. The
border is disappearing. You people are like those Japanese soldiers left
behind on deserted islands who think that World War II is still going
on. Let me be the first to tell you, your government surrendered this
war a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: This attitude’s not gonna help him any, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: I got greedy. I decided to bring a little in
on my own and somebody tipped you off. That was my mistake. Carl would
never be so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He hired you. That was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Carl and I were friends from childhood. He was
loyal, that’s not a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: The busiest land border crossing in the
world. Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand
pedestrians on foot. I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot
of drugs are still getting through.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Any idea how much?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: I’ve read official estimates but I
wouldn’t bet my house on them. I’ve heard the entire cocaine supply for
the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers. At least a
half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope,
with drivers employed by people who don’t give a damn if they’re caught
or not.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What do you look for?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: We ask questions and measure the answers.
When something doesn’t ring true, a fact that doesn’t make sense, a
slight hesitation, then it’s off to secondary for a closer look. Before
NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year. Now it’s almost double.
Pretty soon there’ll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much
freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Any way we can do it better?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Sure. More money in intelligence on their
side of the border. So we have a better idea who we’re looking for. More
dogs. More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to
run the trucks through. Outside of martial law that’s about the best
you’re gonna do. But, I should tell you, there are two things that
really have us on edge right now. In the last six months seizures have
tripled, even though we’re pulling over the same number of cars. What
does that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That triple the amount of stuff is going
through.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Right. But, that’s not the biggest
problem. One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that
traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn
coke into something else. It doesn’t smell like coke. It doesn’t look
like coke. And what’s worse, it doesn’t react to field test. It could be
anything. Maybe it’s already happening. I mean, how would we know?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Yes, hi Jenny, account number 4168 2245
3173… I need a cash advance.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: What’s the largest amount I can get? Okay, I
guess that’ll have to do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay. She’s coming out. She’s leaving her
property. Okay, she seems to be heading for the van! She is approaching
the van!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What do you think she wants?</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: She’s your girlfriend. Open it, talk about
your kids.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I so hope I didn’t startle you. I thought
you might like some cold lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Uh… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I know this is a difficult situation and
you’re only doing your jobs. I don’t bear you any ill-will, but I do
have a small favor to ask.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: You want to ask us a favor?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: A man threatened my children. These charges
have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be bringing all the
nut-jobs out of the nut jar. Would you keep an eye out for anything out
of the ordinary. I don’t know what else to do.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Of course, we will.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: It’s probably poisoned.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: It’s good. Not too sweet.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Anna. What’s wrong? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t find Manolo.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He never came home last night. Was he with
you?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m worried. Last time he was out late, I went
through his clothes while he was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: What the fuck are you doing? You’re supposed
to be at work. Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: It’s no problem. I was just with everybody
we work with.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Oh, really. General Salazar was there?</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: No, but a lot of other people. You should
come. You should come out with us.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Go home. Get cleaned up. Get to work.
Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I’m not getting
left behind. Don’t fuck this up.</p>
<p><strong>hughes</strong>: The word going around is you’re not that
happy in your work. Maybe we can help.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You know my dad takes eight red cold pills
every day? He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to
seven, set your clock, two bourbons –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Maybe we could show up and smoke a little
rock with them to unwind –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at
the end of a long day.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Have you done your homework, honey?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yes, mom –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Then here’s a little bump.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Drugs weren’t even a problem until a hundred
years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem. Opiates.
But, who was using ’em? Chinese immigrants. Slave labor. And the darkies
up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju- ju music.
People on the fringe. Artists. Decadent rich people. And who got scared?
White men in power. Who’s scared today? White men in power. If J.P.
Morgan and John D. Rockefeller ever admitted using, it’d be a whole
different story.</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: What you want?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: 911, and the come down.</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Two hundred of C, hundred of the other.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Come on… We’ve been here before.</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: Then, let’s see your money.</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: Up the steps. You the experts. You
know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>junkie</strong>: What are you two, about twelve?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Caroline, give me your money.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: Goodbye… Caroline.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: Now, get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We’d like room 205.</p>
<p><strong>deskman</strong>: Then you hand me twenty-eight dollars.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I love this place.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and
Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I think so. If she didn’t she should have.
I’ve only got maybe an hour. Then volleyball practice is over and I have
to be home.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why? Nobody’s there.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: The maid… They ask her what time I get
back. She spies for them.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I wish we could stay here. Just be here
forever and ever. Make it a little home.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I want to have sex and do a hit right as we’re
coming.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>special-agent-in-charge</strong>: …Over 200 DEA field agents,
a budget of almost 100 million dollars and state of the art
communications equipment make the El Paso Information Center the Drug
Enforcement Administration’s flagship for the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Who are these guys?</p>
<p><strong>special-agent-in-charge</strong>: Agents who died in the
field.</p>
<p><strong>special-agent-in-charge</strong>: That house, that you see
from the DEA headquarters, belonged to Porfirio Madrigal – the Lord of
the Skies, largest trafficker in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: He died in a liposuction surgery, right?</p>
<p><strong>special-agent-in-charge</strong>: Right. Now it’s used by
somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants… Who knows?
Every damn day there’s birthday party. At first I thought they must have
three hundred children, then I realized they’re taunting us. Three miles
away and we can’t touch them. Ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>binocular pov</strong>: a child running in circles holding a
clutch of colored balloons.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Who do we interface with on their side?</p>
<p><strong>special-agent-in-charge</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico
side?</p>
<p><strong>special-agent-in-charge</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t think
there’s any one person. See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns
everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side,
sometimes all the property on both sides. Warehouses, transportation,
even tunnels. It’s very organized.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I want everyone thinking out the box for a
second. What are we gonna do about Mexico? Come on, guys. Out of the
box.</p>
<p><strong>rep from dea</strong>: Unlimited funds?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>rep from dea</strong>: From a DEA standpoint we need a vetted
task force and matching funds. And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Come on. I want to hear from everyone: FBI.
Customs. Treatment. Is there anyone from treatment on this plane? Then I
want an answer for why there isn’t anyone from treatment. Look, we know
we have to bust one of these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, not just as a
symbol, but hell yes, also as a symbol - they are symbols - and there’s
nothing wrong with sending a message. That’s why when Carlos Ayala hired
Michael Adler lead defense, I flew Ben Williams to San Diego to
prosecute. Because he’s the best we have, he’s our symbol that we’re
serious about putting the top people away. So, as of right now, this
flight only, consider the dam on new ideas thrown open.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: If I’m not mistaken, we got DEA, Pentagon,
U.S. Attorneys office, about a billion dollars of budget right here. So
what are you people waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: On a clear day you can see Mexico City.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: This place is swept twice a day. I learned
that in Miami in ’85. Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but
it’s a big game of wack-a-mole. Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.
And San Diego is so much more relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my
children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Helena, if I had it I would give it to you,
but I don’t have that kind of money.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Arnie, help me. Doesn’t anyone owe us
money?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Yes, I told you before, there are people who
owe you money but they’re not paying. There’s too much heat on Carl.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Please. Tell me who Carl sells to.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Even if I knew I wouldn’t tell you. You do
not want to come into contact with these people. Only Carl knows who
they are. That’s his real asset. Ruiz doesn’t know them. They don’t know
Ruiz. Church and State.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: What about legitimate businesses? We own a
construction concern, real estate –</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Laundromats for the washing of money.
Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Don’t you have some good news? Isn’t there
something positive you could say.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Sometimes I wonder what I’ll do if Carl
doesn’t get out. I’m not very adept at being on my own. I’ve always had
a man in my life. Always.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I remember when I first met you: little Helen
Watts from the wrong side of somewhere. I had a feeling even then that
your survival instincts were pretty well honed.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’m glad you think so, but I’m picturing a
debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being
compared to Pablo Escobar. And I’m wondering who would want to be with
someone like that?</p>
<p><strong>rosario</strong>: You two don’t like me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: We don’t have an opinion on you.</p>
<p><strong>rosario</strong>: Maybe it’s because I’m getting an apartment
nicer than anything you’ll ever see in your life?</p>
<p><strong>rosario</strong>: I can’t believe the old man kept his
promise.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: The General is a man of his word.</p>
<p><strong>rosario</strong>: They will say anything to get what they
want, but then you remind them, it’s always tomorrow, tomorrow,
tomorrow. Occupational hazard, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>rosario</strong>: His friend is giving us the apartment so
it’s not like he paid. It’s more like a favor.</p>
<p><strong>rosario</strong>: You don’t have the keys. Oh that’s perfect.
Are you an idiot?</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: There’s supposed to be someone here to let
you in.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Madrigal’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Porfirio Madrigal is not dead. I just saw
him.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: This is why Salazar is so interested in
cleaning up Tijuana. Madrigal, who’s supposed to be dead, owns him. And
Madrigal is making a move on Juan Obregon.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Javi! Come on. Don’t pull this you don’t
care bullshit. This is incredible information. It must be. Javi –</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: We keep our mouths shut.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I think we may have found our Mexican Drug
Czar. It’s this General, Salazar. At least I’ll have somebody on the
other side I can talk to.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Does this mean you’re going to be gone
more?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You might want to pencil in a little
face-time with your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Barbara –</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Because I’m at the edge of my capabilities,
Robert.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The first thing we have to do is present a
unified front.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: If you start in on the war metaphors I’m
going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Look, I’m as worried as you are –</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, I don’t think so. Leave me alone, give
me money. That’s what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting
me out that seems very familiar.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah, well, she has a way of self-
medicating that probably seems familiar, too.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m not the one who has to have three
scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I have a drink before dinner to take the
edge off my day. That’s different.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, it is?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored
to death.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Why don’t you go in and tell your daughter
how bored you are.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Caroline. Open this door immediately.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Who is it? I’m going to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: One minute.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Excuse me –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’re not going anywhere, young lady.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Where is it? Where are the drugs? Where are
they?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Fuck you. I wasn’t doing anything. You’re
like the Gestapo.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Fuck me? Oh, okay. Fuck me. Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m going to ask you one time to tell me the
truth so that I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Okay, young lady, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Like I give a fuck.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What is wrong with you? What? You’re going
away. You’re getting help somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You can’t make me.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Oh, yes I can.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>hughes</strong>: Special Agent Hughes, Drug Enforcement
Administration of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Somewhere safe.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: A place we have, that we know is
protected.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hughes</strong>: It’s really safe.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Okay. Where would you like to go?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: It’s important that we work together.
Mexico. America. One hand washing the other.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: We agree.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: So… maybe you tell me about your informants
in our operations.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: We thought maybe you’d have that kind of
information for us.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: This is a very different proposition.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: We pay for that kind of information.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Is that what you’re talking about,
Javier?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Ten years ago Tijuana had no drug problem.
Now it is epidemic. Ten years ago America takes a hammer to Pablo
Escobar, a hammer to the Miami drug trade, and you allowed everything to
move to my country. You dumped the problem at our feet. Now, drug use is
epidemic. Now, the treatment centers are full and get no state money.
They survive on donations and what they get for building doghouses to
sell to the</p>
<p><strong>u.s.</strong>: We need lights for the parks so kids can play
at night. So they can play baseball. So it’s safe. Everybody likes
parks. Everybody likes baseball. What I’m talking about is I would like
to see somebody take an interest in Tijuana. That’s what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>hughes</strong>: Javi, You want to come see us again, you’re
going on the box. No more of this water-wing bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: You wanna tell me what the hell that was
all about?</p>
<p><strong>hughes</strong>: He’s got something. We just have to be
patient.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How’s David?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: How’s David? How’s David? He’s terrific,
Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Helena –</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: We watched his father get dragged away by
federal agents. I don’t even know how to begin to tell him where you are
or when you’re coming back… Or if you’re coming back.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We’ll get through this, I promise. I’ll make
it up to you –</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: How? Supportive letters from prison while
I’m being kicked out of our home? Do you have any idea what is happening
out here? Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should
see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the
government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken
against an income tax lien. Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a
public hanging. Nobody will help us. Nobody will take us in. Nobody
wants anything to do with us. So tell me, Carl, how you’re gonna make it
up to me. Tell me again how we’ll get through this, and maybe while
you’re at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a
tender moment of connection.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Helena –</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Tell me what to do, Carl. I need guidance,
not a fucking platitude. I’m not bringing a child into the kind of life
I grew up with. I won’t do it. I want our life back.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I built our house and I don’t want to lose
it. Every stone, every brick, every board. My business… That would take
a lot of private study… That you don’t have time for. I suggest you look
into the Coronel… Into selling it. If you can stomach it, you should
look into it.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Look into the Coronel; otherwise, there is
nothing to do.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So it was my birthday an my ex-wife was
getting remarried and I was in some church basement telling a bunch of
strangers how it was a good day because I didn’t have to eat out of a
dumpster. That was enough to send me out on big one. I’ve been thinking
a lot about the first step: that I came to believe I was powerless over
alcohol and that my life had become unmanageable. See my disease tells
me I don’t have a disease. That I’m fine. That it’s my birthday and I
can have one little drink, then one little line, then one little Valium,
then two more fat lines, then two more 10 mil Valium… Six months later I
wake up in a sober living house in Philly. And I’m from Dallas, people.
It’s a disease – an allergy of the body and an obsession of the mind. I
know that now. So my name’s Marty and today I’m a grateful recovering
alcoholic who didn’t eat out of a dumpster. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Hi. I’m Caroline. I’m not sure I’m an
alcoholic. I mean I don’t really like to drink. For someone my age it’s
so much easier to get drugs than beer. I don’t know, this is really
weird and I’m really nervous…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I guess I’m angry. I mean I think I’m
really angry about a lot of stuff, but I don’t know what exactly.</p>
<p><strong>art appraiser</strong>: Tamayo. Carrington. A simply
wonderful collection of Mexican Modern. Give me three months. I know
several collectors in South America, very discreet.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I don’t have three months.</p>
<p><strong>art appraiser</strong>: It takes time to find the proper
collection.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: How much will you give me in cash?
Today.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You must be joking. That’s a fraction of
their value.</p>
<p><strong>art appraiser</strong>: I’m sorry, but that is the figure I
can get today.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Get out. Get out of my house.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: It’s all right. We’re have a disagreement,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: I recruited the best men in Mexico for my
task force and put them through a rigorous screening process. Not only
physical, but also psychological.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’d like to bring you up to Washington, walk
you around our side of things, and share some of the information we’ve
been able to develop on your cartels.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: That would be very helpful to me. Also, I
received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at
Quantico. I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to
absorb some of your methods.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: I’ve been too busy to completely settle
in.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’ve been making very good progress
against the Tijuana cartel.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will
be taken into custody before the end of the year. But, you must
understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police
force. We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is
already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Hopefully the exchange of training methods
and information between our countries will help with this problem.</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Yes, I hope so as well.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Let me ask you a related question. We’ve
talked about the supply side, but what about demand? What is your policy
for treating addiction?</p>
<p><strong>salazar</strong>: Addicts treat themselves… they overdose and
then there’s one less to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: This is ridiculous. Why is there no
elevator?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: When the DEA gets into the narcotics
business, then we’ll stay at the Four Seasons.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Eddie, how you like your new home? I hope
you hate it as much as I do.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz’s pov</strong>: of the Federal Court building not far
away.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: This is not what my lawyers negotiated.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Fuck your lawyers. You aren’t getting any
cappuccino or Biscotti either.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He first came to me in January. That would’ve
been nineteen eighty- seven. He wanted to rent warehouse space along the
harbor. I didn’t ask too many questions; I’m a businessman also.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. berry</strong>: I told Mr. Ayala there were
irregularities in his tax return. And I couldn’t represent him unless we
could explain this…</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I was the company secretary from 1991 to
1994. I supposedly worked for all six companies. But… they weren’t… I
mean, it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone. We never
sold anything the whole time I was there. Sometimes people came and got
paid. I don’t really know what we did.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Did Mr. Ayala say where the money came
from?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: No, and I didn’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Where do you think it came from?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: This speculation –</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: I’ll rephrase. Did you feel like you
were engaged in a legal enterprise?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: A friend… of Carlos Ayala.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’m on a special phone, may I speak
freely?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: You may speak.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I have a job for you and I don’t have much
time.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I love this place. Don’t turn around.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: You were followed by the police, but they
won’t hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You’re kidding. Can’t you shoot him or
something?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I don’t really like guns. You shoot
someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them
alive.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: When will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: I don’t know. Eduardo Ruiz is the only
real witness against Carl. The security is very tight. There may not be
a way.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: There’s always a way. If people get to the
Pope or the President, you can get to him.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: Careful… You’re sounding like your
husband, Mrs. Ayala.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s very hard for me to come and tell you
this.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s Manolo. He’s going to do something
stupid. I’m worried that he’ll get himself killed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’s saying he’s going to talk to the
Americans. Become an informer.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Why does he need money?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a
lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nine thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: What is he planning on telling them?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, you know, he’s going to say about
Madrigal… and Salazar.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Nobody saw her leave? Yes… I understand.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I have to go. I have to go home.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Should we bring the police into this?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: She’s not at that place you sent her?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: She snuck away. And we haven’t seen her. She
hasn’t come home.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh, man –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: She hasn’t called you?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I tried to talk to her when she was up there,
but they wouldn’t put me through. I’m surprised she hasn’t called.</p>
<p><strong>hustlers</strong>: What you want? Rock? Rock? Hey, what you
want?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Can you tell me anything? Do you have any
ideas?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m not the police. I don’t care about
experimentation. She’s a kid. I’m worried to death.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You won’t say anything to my parents?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I don’t give a fuck about your parents –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We sometimes went downtown to score.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: The West End. We buy it off the streets. I can
stop, you know, and she can’t. Two people, really similar, we can talk
about anything, but for me it’s like a weekend thing, then I get my shit
together, and for her it’s different –</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You don’t know what the hell you’re talking
about. You’re a cocky seventeen year-old and you don’t have a clue what
the stakes are. You don’t know the value of the life you’ve yet to throw
away. And neither does she.</p>
<p><strong>face</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What do you mean, what do I want?</p>
<p><strong>face</strong>: Rock or dope, man?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I don’t want anything.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hey man, I’m sorry. I’m just trying to
help.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You want to help? Stay the fuck away from
her.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m looking for my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: What the fuck do you want?</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: You want some of that?</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: What you gonna do to get some of that?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Please –</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: What you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: Maybe a taste.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: Feed this to you like a little bird.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: You want this?</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: This is the Express train. Baby turnin’ pro
and getting down in a big, big hole.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: Kiss it. Kiss your new mommy hello.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Your honor, it has come to our attention that
your honor, while in private practice, previously represented the town
of Seal Beach in their stop-work suit against the Police Department of
Seal Beach. We believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case and
we therefore move for a temporary suspension while this is
investigated.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Adler, this is a most unusual motion.</p>
<p><strong>adler</strong>: Nonetheless, your honor, we feel that our
client deserves every fairness afforded under the law.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: If this is in any way designed to delay the
testimony of Eduardo Ruiz…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: We’ll recess until 9:00 am Monday morning.
And I’ll see counsel in chambers.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that
chef, for like six months?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Oh, man, I’ve never eaten so good in my
life. Why don’t you develop a useful skill?</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Yeah, like turning into a beautiful
woman.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Would you mind if today we walked? It’s one
block. I could use the fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: They’re not getting into the car. What
are they doing? They’re walking right at me.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You’ve got a gun. Get out of the car and
shoot him in the head.</p>
<p><strong>francisco</strong>: They’re going to walk right past me.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: What are you? A mouse? Get out of the car
and do it. This is your chance.</p>
<p><strong>castro</strong>: Stay here. I’ll get the car.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I saw this guy at the courthouse. The car
–</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Manolo, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Manolo, have we interrupted?</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: No. I’m looking for the waiter. I want to
order.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: What are you gonna have?</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: A steak.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Well, if you like steak, we know a much
better place. We’ll take you there.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: That’s okay, really.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Manolo, we should really be going now,
before it gets too crowded.</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: I was going to feed them wrong information.
Feed them lies to… it was for…</p>
<p><strong>manolo</strong>: Don’t tell Anna I died like this. Tell her
it was something else. Tell her it was official business. Tell her that
I died doing something honorable. Please, tell her that for me…</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: You got anything you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Sorry about that… we had to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>somebody else</strong>: Are you sure you don’t have anything
to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to
try.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Have you gone crazy? You are not Carl. You
aren’t as good as Carl. They are moving the trial to a high security
location. The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay
out of things. Let us try to win the case.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: That is going to be rather difficult when
all the evidence is against us.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Helena, please. This is out of your
hands.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I know I made things worse. I know that and
I’m sorry, but Arnie I need something from you. Something only you can
help me with.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Helena –</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I need an introduction to the Obregon
Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I figured out what Carl was up to and I need
your help. Will you help me?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: About the other night, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: God, I don’t get it. Are we supposed to say
to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?
Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Mrs. Ayala. Thank you for coming. I am Juan
Marquez, I work for Mr. Obregon. I believe you know my associate,
“Tigrillo,” the Little Tiger.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old
son. I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: No, this is not possible. And I thank you
for coming down here, though I suspect it’s been a pointless
journey.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: I hear these stories. Your husband in jail.
His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: My husband is the victim of an informer in
your organization, not ours.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: That is not true, Mrs. Ayala. Your route is
compromised. Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors
in California.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I don’t think you’re going to do that.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: You don’t? Listen to this woman in a man’s
world, a very violent world.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: There are plenty of other suppliers in
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: But not in whose interest it is to help you
out of debt.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: My husband had been working on something he
called, The Project for the Children. Are you aware of this?</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: I don’t know. Perhaps I remember
something.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: We have the ability to change the color,
odor, and physical property of cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: You want to smuggle narcotics in
Mr. Espastico Jacobo. That’s nothing new.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Not in…</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: This doll is cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Every part, from his ears to his accessory
belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine. Odorless. Undetectable by
dogs. Undetectable by anyone.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Get a bowl.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Try it.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’m six months pregnant. I won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Fine, then we don’t have deal.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Fine, then we don’t have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: That’s good coke.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: It should be… It’s yours. I want our debt
forgiven. I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers
Cocaine for the United States. And I want the principle witness against
my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Perhaps… Perhaps… I’m afraid I must first
ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he
succeeded with flying colors.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Take this back with you. Deliver it safely
to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: That’s crazy. My husband is on trial for
smuggling.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Exactly, and this is how I know I’m not
getting into business with the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You will help me with my other problem.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San
Diego. And we have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: …And I have the electronic serial numbers
for their cellular phones. They change them every twenty-four hours but
I have a contact at MexTel who can get me the new ESNs within
twelve.</p>
<p><strong>hughes</strong>: That’s good shit.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Now that you have what you want, let’s talk
about how I get what I want.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Oh, don’t worry, Javier, you’re not gonna
have any problems there.</p>
<p><strong>hughes</strong>: I want to take a minute and talk about what
type of precautions you’re taking to protect yourself. When Salazar and
Madrigal go down, they might send someone to see you.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: You worry about getting me the things that I
want. I’ll worry about myself.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: You should feel good about this.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I feel like a traitor.</p>
<p><strong>customs officer</strong>: Please step from the car,
Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’m in a hurry –</p>
<p><strong>customs officer</strong>: Step from the car, Ma’am. This
won’t take long from your day.</p>
<p><strong>on the monitor</strong>: Helena’s car is on a lift three feet
off the ground. Officers pour over the inside and undercarriage of the
Mercedes.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Ma’am, we have to ask you to come with
us.</p>
<p><strong>customs matron</strong>: Ma’am, we have reason to believe you
may have illegal drugs hidden beneath your clothing. I need to conduct a
pat down search. Supervisory Inspector Haig will witness the search.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding me. I’m pregnant.
What if I refuse?</p>
<p><strong>customs matron</strong>: This pamphlet explains the law and
your rights under it. You’re welcome to read it first. It says we have
the authority to conduct this search. Would you like to read it first or
shall we proceed?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. castro</strong>: Montel… Oh, Montel.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. castro</strong>: You know how much he cared about you.
You do, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. castro</strong>: I know if he could have it back
somehow, he wouldn’t do it differently or have it any other way. He
wouldn’t. He loved his job.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Excuse me, Agent Gordon. Mrs. Castro. Helena
Ayala left Club Platinum in Tijuana. The Obregon Brothers’ place. They
stopped her at the border but she was clean. She’s in San Diego now.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: What are you thinking, calling me at home
with a message like that? You’ve compromised me and our relationship
–</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: The place is swept twice a day. I learned
that down in Miami in ’85… Arnie. I’m the housewife. I belong to the
most exclusive country club in La Jolla that accepts Latinos. Until
recently, I believed my husband imported hydroponic strawberries, which
I donated at the school fair.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: It’s the same stuff? From the rainy day
stash?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: It’s the same. What happened to what they
gave you?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’m desperate, but I’m not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>sheridan</strong>: I’m sorry… Did I wake you?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: No, it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>sheridan</strong>: Salazar’s been taken down. He was working
for Porfirio Madrigal.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: What? I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought
it was verified.</p>
<p><strong>sheridan</strong>: Apparently not. Look, it’s a shit storm
here right now. When are you coming back? I don’t know what to tell
people any more.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’ll get there as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>sheridan</strong>: If we’re moving the press conference, we
need to do it now. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Robert.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I have to call you back.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The silver wedding cup.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: My Leica’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: So’s the video camera.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: At least she’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: She’ll be at a pawn shop in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hey man, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Excuse me? Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Seth has to be excused. He’s going on a
field trip.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Come on. Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Women’s room, stall two. Should we stop for
ice-cream?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t know, maybe we missed her.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I can’t believe you used to bring my
daughter here, to this place.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hey man, back the fuck up. To this place.
What’s that shit? Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand
white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every
black person they see, You got any drugs? You know where I can get
drugs? What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black
person, on their possibilities? If you sent a hundred thousand black
people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white
person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and
their kids would be selling. It’s market forces, man. The product’s
marked up three hundred percent. You can go out on the street and make
five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the
rest of the day. You think white people would still be going to law
school?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: You’re starting to piss me off. Get out of
the car.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re gonna get me killed.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’m looking for my daughter, Caroline. She
comes here.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: This is a business. Get the fuck outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I need to find my daughter. I’ll pay
you.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the
fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn’t just
put you in a dumpster?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I have money –</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: I got money.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’ll pay you a thousand dollars. I have it
in my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: I want your money, I’ll take your money.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Just tell me where she is.</p>
<p><strong>sketch</strong>: Don’t do that shit again.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Great. What a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Man, I’m telling you. Don’t do this vigilante
thing. Either the cops find her or she’ll call you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Anna. Anna, please. Let me in.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Come on. You can’t stay locked in your house
all day.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I know this is a tragedy, but you have to
realize that good has come out of it.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: If Manolo hadn’t gone and told them what he
did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.
He did a great thing for Tijuana. He did a great thing for Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I want to believe you. I really do.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: You will believe me, because it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Open the door. Open the fucking door, man.</p>
<p><strong>muffled voice</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I know she’s in there. Let me talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>muffled voice</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking
about. Go away!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I know she’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, I haven’t touched her –</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Hi, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: It’s gonna be great… I mean, I’m okay and
all, because, see, I met a guy, he’s in this pretty famous band and…
They’ve invited me to write lyrics for them, I’m gonna be able to do
that and maybe sing, too… not at first, but later.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I’ve been doing research for the school
paper, that’s what I’ve been doing, like on assignment kind-of, I’ve
seen some stuff you wouldn’t believe, but I’m gonna write it all down
into lyrics. They think I’m really good, everybody says so, what do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: Salazar and Madrigal are no longer with us.
A feat none of these people could get accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>marquez</strong>: You’re going to be made the Special
Assistant to the new drug Czar, which makes you a very valuable law
enforcement officer. I hope you like to travel because we have plans for
Juarez and El Paso, Nogales, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Michoacan…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: How was she?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m really not sure. She seemed to
recognize it wasn’t Serenity Oaks. It’s a pretty hard-core facility, but
at least we know where she is. Maybe it’s what she needs now.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Big day. You’re a star.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Go shower. You smell.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>somebody</strong>: The Mafia. I’ve got his breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Where’s the love gone, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You expect me to be grateful for spending the
rest of my life looking over my shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: That thought makes me feel awful.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: Can’t you for a second imagine none of this
had happened? That my drugs had gone through. What would have been the
harm? A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is
still alive. We avoid having breakfast together. Don’t you see this
means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You’re breaking my heart.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: The worst thing about you, Monty, is you
realize the futility of what you’re doing and you do it anyway. I wish
you could see how transparent you are. This food tastes like shit.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: So go shower already.</p>
<p><strong>ruiz</strong>: You only got to me because you were tipped off
by the Juarez Cartel, who’s trying to break into Tijuana. You’re helping
them. You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: And shave. You better look nice and
believable for the jury.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: It’s like having another wife.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>somebody else</strong>: Breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>somebody else</strong>: Hurry up. It’s getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>man with tray</strong>: I’m on your side. God, you’re
jumpy.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Call an ambulance. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Call the ambulance. Don’t die on me. You
will not die on me. Do you hear me? Don’t you die on me.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the
jury… Because of the sudden death of Eduardo Ruiz, the people have
decided that at this point we cannot continue our case against Carl
Ayala.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Yeah, hi – So I’ve got a copy of
your speech here… It’s fantastic… So, Robert, my genuine thanks. You’re
my choice and you’re gonna be great. The President is sorry he hasn’t
been able to spend more time with you. After the press conference he
wants to really sit down. Oh, I got to the Post, too. Don’t worry about
that thing with your daughter, it’s not news; they’re willing to treat
it as a family matter, a personal matter. Look, even if it came out,
we’d turn it into a qualification, I’ve been in the trenches of this
Drug War, I have seen the face of the enemy, etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: This seizure is one of the largest seizures
in Mexican history… It represents the first bilateral effort of the
American DEA and the Mexican</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Today I’m very proud to announce that
Mexico, with the help of our American partners, is finally winning the
war against narcotics trafficking.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast
brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through
into El Paso?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I’m aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: So what’s it doing in Tijuana?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if
Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of
power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: It could mean that, yes.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel
is gaining power?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: It’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico
who isn’t connected in some war to one of the cartels?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Yeah, it’s possible… if you’re prepared to
die.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It’s Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Carl, I’m running late. I’m coming right now
–</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: So Arnie, when were you going to tell me
about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after
I got arrested?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I was just waiting for the right time.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: And you didn’t feel like you could trust my
wife with this news?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I just didn’t want to take a chance. I didn’t
want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything
else.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You had it all figured out. You move into my
house. You raise my kids. You sleep with my wife. It was a good plan,
Arnie.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Carl, that’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: So my wife is lying?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip
you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed. I wouldn’t sit
next to you in court listening to the dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Arnie, do think there’s a difference between
a reason and an excuse, because I don’t think there is.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Carl –</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Goodbye Arnie.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Arnie. He’s not going to be able to make the
barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Come downstairs. Everyone is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hello, Helena. What a great party.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Nobody. I’m a nobody who arrested you, but
your wife is a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Hey, you can’t be in here.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’m a cop.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Throw him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You didn’t win, Helena. You lost everything.
Tell your children a nice bedtime story… How you killed my partner.</p>
<p><strong>press secretary</strong>: …a sterling reputation and close
friend of the President, recently confirmed into The Office of National
Drug Control Policy… our new Drug Czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: The War on Drugs is a war on our nation’s
most precious resource… our children. Sixty-eight million children have
been targeted by those who perpetrate this war and protecting those
children must be priority number one. There has been progress and there
have been failures, but where we have fallen short I see not a problem
but an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: An opportunity to correct the mistakes of
the past while laying a solid foundation for the future. This takes not
only new ideas, but perseverance. This takes not only resources, but
courage. This takes not only government, but families.</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I’ve… I’ve outlined a ten-point plan,
representing a new bilateral effort…</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: I can’t do this. If there is a War on Drugs
then our own families have become the enemy. How can you wage war on
your own family?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: On the good days I feel like I get it,
like it all makes sense. I can stay in the moment. I don’t have to
control everything in the future. And I believe everything is going to
work out fine. On the bad days, I just want to grab the phone and start
dialing numbers. I want to pull my hair and run through the streets
screaming. But, thanks to the people I’ve met in these rooms, people
like Margaret and Jim and Sarah, people who’ve taught me how to listen,
I’m pretty sure I’ll make it through today.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Would you like to share?</p>
<p><strong>robert</strong>: My name is Robert. This is my wife, Barbara.
We’re Caroline’s parents. We’re just hear to listen.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: We’re back up and running. Completely
untouchable. Completely.</p>
