<h1 id="miller-s-crossing">miller-s-crossing</h1>
<p><strong>close shot a whiskey tumbler</strong>: That sits on an oak
side bar under a glowing green bankers lamp, as two ice cubes are
dropped in. From elsewhere in the room:</p>
<p><strong>the speaker</strong>: A balding middle-aged man with a round,
open face. He still wears his overcoat and sits in a leather chair in
the dark room, illuminated by the offscreen glow of a desk lamp. This is
Johnny Caspar.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Another well dressed, middle aged man,
behind a large polished oak desk, listening intently. This is Leo. He is
short but powerfully built, with the face of a man who has seen
things.</p>
<p><strong>the woods credit sequence</strong>: Although it is day, the
tree cover gives an effect of almost cathedral-like darkness. The sun
filters down through the leaves in gently shifting patterns.</p>
<p><strong>close shot tom</strong>: Unshaven, eyes closed,
motionless.</p>
<p><strong>a hallway</strong>: A loose shot looking over Tom’s shoulder
as he knocks on an partment door. Head credits continue.</p>
<p><strong>close shot a fedora</strong>: Lying on a marble bureau top in
a dark room. A gently rippling cookie plays over it–light from a
streetlamp thrown through a curtained window. Reflected in the bureau
mirror behind the fedora we see the soft glow of a burning
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Tracking in on Tom, sitting in bed,
smoking, staring at the bureau. The rippling street light plays over him
from the window. We hear a distant knocking.</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: The bedroom, as Tom swings his legs around
and gets out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>6. living room</strong>: Also dark, lit only by streetlight
filtering in.</p>
<p><strong>7. int bedroom</strong>: As Tom opens the double oak doors
and enters, leaving them open.</p>
<p><strong>7. ext alleyway early morning</strong>: We are on an extreme
close shot of a small dog. Behind him, in the distance, we can see the
mouth of the alley.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: is slouched, half-sitting, against the wall
of the alley. He is motionless. His mouth is agape. His eyes are rolled
up in a lifeless stare.</p>
<p><strong>close shot a little boy</strong>: Perhaps five years old. He
stares down at the dead man in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>close shot the man</strong>: Staring vacantly.</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: After a moment, he reaches forward.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: As the boy’s hand enters frame. The boy
pokes once at the man’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Staring.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Also staring, his skewed hairpiece ill
becoming his stunned expression.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot the alley</strong>: The dead man and the little bov
face each other in profile in the middle foreground. In the background,
between them, the little boy’s dog faces us, still on point, still
whining.</p>
<p><strong>int diner evening</strong>: A man sits facing us at the
counter in the foreground. His face is hidden by the newspaper he is
reading.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Looking down at the newspaper an the
counter, next to a steaming cup of coffee. Tom’s hand enters to put some
change on the counter, leaves, and we hear his receding footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>tracking in to close shot plaque</strong>: Set into the brick
of a building’s exterior, it reads: SHENANDOAH CLUB. In script
underneath: Members Only.</p>
<p><strong>11. int the club night</strong>: Tracking towards the front
door as Tom enters. He puts his coat and hat on the check counter.</p>
<p><strong>on beryl</strong>: A diminutive woman in a french maid’s
uniform with a pill box hat. She rocks her weight on one leg with her
hands proceed defiantly on her hips.</p>
<p><strong>tracking shot</strong>: Pulling Tom as he walks across the
gambling floor. He is joined bv a nervous young man in a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>13. int leo’s office</strong>: Pulling Tom as he enters the
office.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Leo faces us from behind his desk.</p>
<p><strong>fat tony</strong>: Tending the downstairs bar as Tom stalks
over.</p>
<p><strong>15. int ladies’ lounge</strong>: As Tom bangs through the
door, still carelessly holding his tumbler of whiskey. A rogue lock of
hair hangs down over his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: The hubbub of female voices evaporates as
all turn to look at the male intruder.</p>
<p><strong>int tom’s apartment</strong>: A wide shot, facing the
semi-circular windows, the door of the apartment behind us. A large easy
chair in the middle foreground faces away from us: a smaller chair is at
the window end of the room, facing us.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Slouched in a chair, in the corner of the
room, facing Tom, is Bernie Bernheim. He is about thirty and wears his
overcoat and hat and a good-natured smile. He holds an apple in one hand
and a paring knife in the other. The long peel of the apple corkscrews
down off the knife.</p>
<p><strong>17. street day</strong>: Pulling Tom along the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>18. int room</strong>: It is a large room with a couple of
card tables, straight- backed chairs, a ratty sofa–a sparsely furnished
card room off the main floor of a club.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Over black we hear the sound of running
water.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Gasping for air as his head is pulled out from
under a running faucet.</p>
<p><strong>22. ext the building</strong>: We see that the building’s
facade claims to be SABBATINI’S</p>
<p><strong>antiques and collectibles.</strong>: Tom weaves across the
street with his battle and glass towards O’Gar, the police chief,
leaning against a squad car, chewing a toothpick. He is watching
morosely as his men load other men into paddywagons; the street is
clogged with police vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>23. hallway</strong>: We are shooting over Tom’s shoulder as
he knocks at the door to Verna’s apartment.</p>
<p><strong>24. int apartment</strong>: As Verna gives up and Tom
enters.</p>
<p><strong>another window night</strong>: A living room window, open,
its white sheers billowing lazily in the draft.</p>
<p><strong>over his shoulder</strong>: Waiting in the darkness just
outside is another man in a topcoat and fedora. He is holding two tommy
guns.</p>
<p><strong>26. a victrola</strong>: The song is louder at the cut. We
are in an upstairs bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Stretched out an his bed, wearing a robe over
his pyjamas, smoking a cigar, listening–but only to the phonograph. Its
sound covers any other noise in the house.</p>
<p><strong>27. stairway</strong>: A close track on the two pairs of feet
climbing the stairs. We see only the feet, the swaying hems of the
topcoats and, occasionally dipping into frame, the muzzles of the two
tommy guns.</p>
<p><strong>26. bedroom</strong>: Leo, is motionless, looking down, a
puzzled expression.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The floor.</p>

song grows louder.</p>
<p><strong>26. bedroom</strong>: Leo, looking, slowly taking the cigar
from his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom door</strong>: From inside as–CRASH–it is kicked
in.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Hitting the floor and rolling under the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>the two gunmen</strong>: Striding into the room.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: On his belly under the bed, facing the door,
swinging a handgun in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: From floor level, the bottom of the
mattress above us, the floorboards stretching away.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Jaw clamped on his cigar, he starts firing.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Blood spurts as one gunman takes a hit in
the ankle.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Still firing.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The other gunman is ducking out the
door.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Firing.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: A bullet hit in the top of the fallen man’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Rolling out from under the bed.</p>
<p><strong>28. hallway</strong>: Facing down the length of the dark
hallway, towards the mouth of the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>29. second room</strong>: Leo throws open a window.</p>
<p><strong>30. ext</strong>: As Leo rolls out onto the long sloping eave
of a front porch.</p>
<p><strong>leo’s pov</strong>: The second floor window that he just
emerged from. Staccato gunfire erupts in the dark room.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Firing, the gun jumping and bucking in his
hands.</p>
<p><strong>29. inside the room</strong>: The gunman, riddled with
bullets and showered with broken glass, spins around, his thompson still
firing uncontrol- lably.</p>
<p><strong>back to leo</strong>: As we hear the screech of skidding
tires. A black coupe takes a curve on the street behind him, machine gun
fire spitting out of the back window.</p>
<p><strong>on the car</strong>: Growing smaller, still snitting fire and
lead.</p>
<p><strong>pulling leo</strong>: Still walking calmly up the street, the
gun still bucking in his hands. Bullets whistle by and claw up the
pavement around him.</p>
<p><strong>behind leo</strong>: His robe whips back in the breeze. He
fires again and we hear the distant sound of shattering glass. The car
weaves, runs up off the road, hits a tree and bursts into flame.</p>
<p><strong>close on leo</strong>: As he stops, squinting, raising the
gun.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The burning gunman zig-zagging into the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>back to leo</strong>: A faint smile curls around the cigar.
He drops the muzzle of the gun.</p>
<p><strong>upstairs hallway shenandoah club</strong>: The explosion
echoes over the cut as we track up the hallway behind Tom and a tall
cadaverous man with pre- maturely white hair. This is Dead Terry
McGill.</p>

<p><strong>33. hallway</strong>: Pulling Tom up the hall.</p>
<p><strong>tom’s apartment</strong>: Wide shot of his living room,
facing the windows. It is night.</p>
<p><strong>the door</strong>: As Tom swings it open. Verna stands in the
hallway outside. After a wordless beat she moves past him into the
apartment. Tom turns and follows her.</p>
<p><strong>the bedroom</strong>: Tom sits perched on the edge of the
bed, smoking a ciga- rette. Verna is in bed behind him. The lamp on the
nightstand is burning a faint yellow.</p>

Frankie, his nose swathed with bandages, is closing the door from the
outside.</p>

not responding to Frankie who prods him with his foot.</p>

Bernie in the foreground. Tree limbs groan in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>close bernie</strong>: Still kneeling, in shock, staring
wide-eyed at Tom.</p>
<p><strong>close on tom</strong>: Watching Bernie go.</p>
<p><strong>tracking</strong>: Pulling Bernie as he runs. Foreground
trees flash by. In the background we see Tom standing, his gun dangling
at his side.</p>
<p><strong>41. wide the road</strong>: Tic-Tac and Frankie are leaning
against the car, trading the flask back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>42. fade in</strong>: Looking down a deserted street towards
a glowing phone booth on a dark corner. Tom stands inside the booth
waiting, the receiver to his ear.</p>

office.</p>
<p><strong>close shot a man’s face</strong>: Crunch!–being hit by a
gloved hand.</p>
<p><strong>close on a newspaper</strong>: As the noise of fists against
flesh continues, echoing, in the background.</p>
<p><strong>on tom</strong>: Leaning against a pillar in a large bare
room with a hardwood floor. He is reading the newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>45. ext the gym</strong>: Peeling paint on its blackened-out

taking a speeding turn onto the street.</p>

at the car:</p>
<p><strong>police car</strong>: Cops with guns hang out every window.
They start firing.</p>
<p><strong>tracking towards bert</strong>: Bert</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: About a block away, a man with white hair
is crossing the street, from the side where the sniper’s shot came
from.</p>
<p><strong>back to tom</strong>: As he starts to leave.</p>
<p><strong>48. int diner</strong>: Dead Terry McGill sits at a stool
looking angrily down at a cup of coffee. Tom enters to sit next to
him.</p>
<p><strong>doorknob</strong>: As–CRASH–a foot enters to kick it and the

<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Facing the door, from behind Bluepoint and
Verna.</p>
<p><strong>bang.</strong>: Bluepoint straightens up from the body and
turns.</p>
<p><strong>low and wide on bluepoint</strong>: One corpse an the floor
beside him, the other corpse in the doorway behind him.</p>
<p><strong>his pov the window</strong>: The main zoom is now empty.
Sheers billow at the window, now open, that let’s out on the fire
escape. Off:</p>

<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sitting up in bed, smoking a cigarette,
thinking. The bedroom is dark.</p>
<p><strong>51. his pov</strong>: The windows throw moonlit squares onto
the floor. We can see only the legs of someone sitting in the
armchair.</p>

railing. Bernie’s trotting footsteps echo in the stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He runs back to his apartment.</p>
<p><strong>53. apartment</strong>: Tom runs across to the open window
and clambers out.</p>
<p><strong>54. fire escape</strong>: Tom trots down. His bare feet ring

<p><strong>the alley</strong>: As his bare feet hit the pavement. Tom is
a silhouette in the lamplight from the end of the alley.</p>
<p><strong>back door</strong>: Of his apartment building–over Tom’s
shoulder as he enters frame. The empty, brightly lit hall inside runs
straight the length of the building to the front door, which is just
closing.</p>
<p><strong>55. hallway</strong>: As Tom runs through toward the
front.</p>
<p><strong>long shot the hall</strong>: Clucking sympathetically, the
old woman is leaning down to help Tom up. As he drapes an arm over her
shoulder:</p>
<p><strong>close shot plaque</strong>: Set into an exterior wall,
identifying the SHENANDOAH CLUB.</p>
<p><strong>57. int club</strong>: Tom, in his overcoat and hat, is
walking up to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>58. ext the club</strong>: It is just cracking dawn.</p>
<p><strong>59. pulling tom</strong>: As he walks along a nearby street;
we can still faintly hear the sirens and police activity back at the
club.</p>
<p><strong>60. int car</strong>: As Tom sits into the back, next to
Bluepoint. Frankie slides in after him.</p>
<p><strong>61. ext woods</strong>: It is morning; the sun is now fully
up. Bluepoint and Tom walk side-by-side through the woods. Frankie and
Tic-Tac walk several steps ahead of them, each off to one side,
searching. Frankie is singing an old Neapolitan song.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Tracking. A canopy of leaves, sprinkled by
sunlight. The boughs of the trees sough quietly in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Looks forward.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: The backs of Frankie and Tic-Tac as they
walk on ahead.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He looks stupidly at Bluepoint. He looks

<p><strong>bluepoint</strong>: He hauls Tom to his feet and pushes him
towards Tic-Tac.</p>
<p><strong>extreme long shot</strong>: Four very small men in overcoats
and fedoras, looking down at the ground; they are dwarfed by the
surrounding trees.</p>
<p><strong>apartment building door buzzer</strong>: A beat-up panel in
the building’s entryway, listing tenants’ names and apartments opposite
a row of buttons.</p>
<p><strong>63. fourth-floor hallway</strong>: Tom walks up to 4C,
unpocketing a gun. He gently tries the knob, which turns, and
enters.</p>
<p><strong>64. drop’s apartment</strong>: As Tom enters.</p>
<p><strong>a large window</strong>: We are looking at the ground-floor
window from the street. Letters stencilled on the glass identify the
SONS OF ERIN</p>
<p><strong>social club.</strong>: A topcoated man scurries into frame,
knocks out a pane with the grip of a gun, and tosses a small pipelike
device inside. He scurries away and we pan with him across the street to
reveal a line of cars, police and civilian, parked along the far curb.
No men are visible except the scurrying man, who takes cover behind one
of the parked cars.</p>
<p><strong>social club</strong>: A beat. From inside we hear a pair of
trotting footsteps–</p>
<p><strong>the street</strong>: Glass showers the pavement and a charred
rag-doll of a body hits hard, face down, and skids a couple feet. Smoke
wisps from it.</p>
<p><strong>the club</strong>: A lick of flame from the bomb is already
dying and heavy grey smoke is billowing out.</p>
<p><strong>the street</strong>: Men start cautiously rising from behind
the cars. A lot of men. Some wear police uniforms; some are civilians.
All are armed.</p>
<p><strong>the club</strong>: Billowing smoke.</p>
<p><strong>the street</strong>: The men have straightened up. A
policeman calls through a bullhorn:</p>
<p><strong>the club</strong>: After a beat, the front door swings open.
A man emerges, one hand in the air, one holding a handkerchief over his
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>the club window</strong>: Smoke still pouring out.</p>
<p><strong>the street</strong>: Bullet hits chew up the cars and a few
of the men; the others drop back down behind the cars and start
returning fire.</p>
<p><strong>the window</strong>: A forbidding black hole in the exterior
wall. A second tommy has joined the first to pour lead out into the
street.</p>
<p><strong>reception area</strong>: Tracking in an a youngish secretary
in a severe dress, sitting behind a desk.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: On Tom.</p>
<p><strong>67. int mayor’s office</strong>: A grand, high-ceilinged
place. Mayor Levander sits behind his desk sputtering, his face turning
purple. Caspar, sitting across from him, is also turning purple. Sitting
to one side are two identical thirty-year-old men, appar- ently twins,
mustachiced, silent, respectful, mournful, their hands clasped over the
hats in their laps, wearing stiff new-looking suits with old-fashioned
collars.</p>
<p><strong>tom’s apartment</strong>: The phone is ringing at the
cut.</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: We are close on Tom as, in overcoat and
hat, he emerges from his apartment and looks down at the keys in his
hand.</p>
<p><strong>doorway: night</strong>: We are looking over Tom’s shoulder
as he waits in the rain in front of a large oak doorway with
wrought-iron fretwork. At the cut we hear chimes dying, and the door
swings open.</p>
<p><strong>int foyer</strong>: As Tom starts to shrug out of his coat,

walking over to the door to the room to close it.</p>
<p><strong>72. a clock</strong>: A large wall clock. It is 3:30.</p>
<p><strong>73. ext diner</strong>: As Tom pushes the door open and
exits. He tucks his overcoat collar up as he walks; it is pouring
rain.</p>
<p><strong>tree limbs</strong>: Night, but sometime later–it has stopped
raining. The branches groan in the wind. As they sway, streetlight
glitters off the leaves, still wet with rain..</p>

the car pulls away.</p>

down onto a step, a couple steps above the hat.</p>
<p><strong>pulling tom</strong>: He looks up.</p>

body.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Climbing and panning as we draw even with
the head.</p>

Wind is groaning through the hallway.</p>

floor; beyond him, Bernie leans against the doorframe in Tom’s open
doorway, smiling, his arms folded over his chest.</p>

office.</p>
<p><strong>77. downstatrs</strong>: Pulling Tom as he walks across the
gambling floor, drink still in hand.</p>
