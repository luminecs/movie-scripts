<h1 id="thelma--louise">thelma-&amp;-louise</h1>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I got it! Hello.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I hope you’re packed, little housewife,
’cause we are outta her tonight.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl
if I can go.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You mean you haven’t asked him yet? For
Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father? It’s just two
days. For God’s sake, Thelma. Don’t be a child. Just tell him you’re
goin’ with me, for cryin’ out loud. Tell him I’m havin’ a nervous
breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: He already thinks you’re out of your mind,
Louise, that don’t carry much weight with Darryl. Are you at work?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No, I’m callin’ from the Playboy
Mansion.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’ll call you right back.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Darryl! Honey, you’d better hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Damnit, Thelma, don’t holler like that!
Haven’t I told you I can’t stand it when you holler in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m sorry, Doll, I just didn’t want you to
be late.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Hon.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Have a good day at work today.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Hon?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You want anything special for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: No, Thelma, I don’t give a shit what we have
for dinner. I may not even make it home for dinner. You know how Fridays
are.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on
a Friday night. You’d almost think they’s want to forget about it for
the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Well then, it’s a good thing you’re not
regional manager and I am.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: ’Bye, honey. I won’t wait up.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: He’s gonna shit.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Good morning. Why, yes, she is. Is this
Thelma? Oh, Thelma, when you gonna run away with me?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Not this weekend, sweetie, she’s runnin’
away with me. Hi. What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What time are you gonna pick me up?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You’re kiddin’! Alright! I’ll be there
around two or three.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What kind of stuff do I bring?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t know. Warm stuff, I guess. It’s the
mountains. I guess it gets cold at night. I’m just gonna bring
everything.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Okay. I will, too.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: And steal Darryl’s fishin’ stuff.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I don’t know how to fish, Louise.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it,
how hard can it be? I’ll see you later. Be ready.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Hi. This is Jimmy. I’m not here
right now, but I’ll probably be back ’cause… all my stuff’s here. Leave
a message.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Psycho killers…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We don’t need the lantern. The place has
electricity.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I wanna take it anyway. Just in case.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: In case of what?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: In case there’s some escaped psycho killer
on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill
us.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will
come in real handy. Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he
steals the spark plugs.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We’d have to. That thing barely makes it
down the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise, will you take care of the gun?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Why in hell did you bring that?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh, come on, Louise… psycho killers, bears…
snakes! I just don’t know how to use it. So will you take care of
it?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Whose place is this again?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s Bob’s, the day manager’s. He’s gettin’
a divorce, so his wife’s gettin’ this place, so he’s just lettin’ all
his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’ve never had the chance to go out of town
without Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: How come he let you go?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: ’Cause I didn’t ask him.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Aw, shit, Thelma, he’s gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, he has never let me go. He never lets
me do one goddamn thing that’s any fun. All he wants me to do is hang
around the house the whole time while he’s out doing God only knows
what.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I left him a note. I left him stuff to
microwave.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I guess you haven’t heard anything from
Jimmy… yet?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: …never mind.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: One of your friends?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: How much longer is it gonna be? I’m
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Another hour of so. We’ve got enough food
for a month.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’ll never make it… Can’t we stop just for a
few minutes…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We’ve not gonna get to the cabin till after
dark as it is, Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Then what difference does it make if we
stop? Come on. I never get to do stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Alright, but it’s gonna be a quick stop.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I haven’t seen a place like this since I
left Texas.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Isn’t this fun?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Y’all wanna drink?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’ll have Wild Turkey straight up and a Coke
back, please.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Tell me somethin’. Is this my vacation or
isn’t it? I mean, God, you’re as bad as Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I just haven’t seen you like this in a
while. I’m used to seeing you more sedate.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, I’ve had it up to my ass with sedate!
You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really
let our hair down. Well, darlin,’ look out ‘cause my hair is comin’
down!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Alright… I changed my mind. I’ll have a
margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls like you
doin’ in a place like this?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Mindin’ our own business, why don’t you try
it.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, we left town for the weekend ’cause we
wanted to try and have a good time. And because Louise here is mad
because her boyfriend won’t call her while he’s out on the road…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We just wanted to get somethin’ to eat.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, you come to the right place. You like
chili? They got good chili.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Harlan, are you botherin’ these poor
girls?</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Hell, no. I was just bein’ friendly.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: It’s a good thing they’re not all as
friendly as you.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Your name’s Harlan? I got an uncle named
Harlan!</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: You do? Is he a funny uncle? ‘Cause if he
is, then he and I got somethin’ in common.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t mean to be rude, but I’ve got
something I need to talk to my friend about. In private.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Aw, I understand. I didn’t mean to bother
ya. It’s just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves.
You better dance with me before you leave, or I’ll never forgive
you.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh, sure. That’d be fun.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Jeez, Louise, that wasn’t very nice.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Can’t you tell when somebody’s hittin’ on
you?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: So what if he was? It’s all your years of
waitin’ tables has made you jaded, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, just relax, will ya. You’re makin’ me
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: So, Jimmy still hasn’t called yet?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Givin’ him a taste of his own medicine.
Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m sorry, Louise. I know you’re all upset.
It’s just I’m so excited to be out of the house, I guess. I wonder if
Darryl’s home yet.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I wonder if Jimmy’s gotten back.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Why don’t you tell him to just to get lost
once and for all?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Why don’t you ditch that loser husband of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: This one’s on Harlan.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Jimmy’ll come in off the road, you won’t be
there, he’ll freak out and call you a hundred thousand times, and Sunday
night you’ll call him back and, by Monday. He’ll be kissin’ the ground
you walk on.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: In the meantime, you said we were gonna have
some fun. So let’s have some!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma, I’m gonna hit the little girls’
room, and then we gotta hit the road.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise, I’m gonna come with you. I don’t
feel so good.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Oopsy-doopsy. We need to get you some fresh
air, little lady.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m spinning.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: How you feelin’ now, darlin’?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I guess I’m startin’ to feel a little
better.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Yeah, you’re startin’ to feel pretty good to
me, too.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I think I need to keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Don’t. I’m married. I don’t feel good. I’ve
been sick.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: It’s okay. I’m married, too.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: You’re beautiful. It’s okay. I won’t hurt
you. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Stop it! Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is
gonna wonder where I am. Let go!</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Louise is alright.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Don’t you hit me! Don’t you fucking hit
me!</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: You just shut up.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Don’t hurt me. Harlan. Please.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Get lost.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You let her go, you fat fucking asshole, or
I’m gonna splatter your ugly face all over this nice car.</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Now, calm down. We were just havin’ a little
fun.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Looks like you’ve got a real fucked up idea
of fun. Now turn around.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Just for the future, when a woman’s crying
like that, she’s not having any fun!</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: Bitch. I should have gone ahead and fucked
her.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>harlan</strong>: I said suck my cock.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Get the car.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Jesus Christ! Louise, you shot him.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Get the car!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You watch your mouth, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Get back to the interstate.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Shit! I… I, which way?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: West. Left.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t know, Thelma! I don’t know! Just
shut up a minute so I can think.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Shouldn’t we go to the cops? I mean, I think
we should tell the police.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you
think we should tell them?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I don’t know. Just tell ’em what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Which part?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: All of it. That he tried to rape me.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to
goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma! Who’s gonna believe that?! We
just don’t live in that kind of world. Pull over!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise… Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh Christ. Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’ve gotta stop for a minute. I’ve got to
get it together. I’m gonna find a place to get a cup of coffee and I’m
gonna sit down for a second. Do you want to come?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Is that yes? Are you up to this?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We gotta be inconspicuous. Do you know what
that means?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It means you don’t talk to anybody. You
don’t draw attention to yourself in any way. Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Tell me you understand that.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We have to think this through. We have to be
smart. Now is not the time to panic. If we panic now, we’re done for.
Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us. We’re still okay. Now all we have
to do is just figure out our next move.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Our next move? I’ll say one thing, Louise.
This is some vacation. I sure am having a good time. This is real
fun.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: If you weren’t so concerned with having a
good time, we wouldn’t be here right now.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Just what is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It means shut up, Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: So this is all my fault, is it.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Just shut up.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom. I… Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Could you identify ’em, if ya saw ’em
again?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Hal, I’ve told you about twenty times, yes, I
could identify ’em, but neither one of them was the type to pull
something like this.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Well, you’re not exactly an expert witness, but
what makes you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: If waitin’ tables in a bar don’t make you an
expert on human nature, then nothin’ will, and I could’ve told you that
Harlan Puckett would end up buyin’ it in a parkin’ lot. I’m just
surprised it didn’t happen before now.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Who do you think did it?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Has anybody asked his wife? She’s the one I
hope did it.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya? Do have
any ideas or don’t ya? I been standin’ in this stupid parkin’ lot all
goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home
in time to get back up again!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Well, if I had to guess, I’d say it was some
ol’ gal, some ol’ gal’s husband. But it wasn’t either one of those two.
The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You didn’t happen to notice what kind of car
they were driving?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: It’s a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal. I don’t
follow the customers to the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Alright, Lena. Go on home. We might have to
call you in for some more questioning.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Those girls are not the murderous type.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Collect from Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Thanks. I’ll try later.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma… Come on, Thelma!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We’re gonna go to the next town and stop.
We’ll get a motel room. I can rest for a while and then figure out how
to get some money. We’re gonna need money. Thelma. How much money do you
have with you?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What? Oh, I don’t know. Let me look.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Sixty-four dollars.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Umm. Shit. Forty-four dollars.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m cash poor.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Hmmm. We gotta get some money.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Why are you unpacking? You said we were just
gonna take a nap.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I’m just nervous. I gotta
figure out what to do.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, when you figure it out, wake me
up.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Just what the hell is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Why are you actin’ like this?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Actin’ like what?! How am I supposed to act?
’Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody’s head
off!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You could help me try and figure it out! I
gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I suggested we go to the police, but you
didn’t like that; so, frankly, Louise, I’m all out of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, what’s the big rush, Thelma? If we
just give ’em some time, they’ll come to us…! Oh Christ. I’m just not
ready to go to jail yet. Why don’t you go out to the pool or something
and I’ll figure it out…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Give me the keys.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You’re not touchin’ that car.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: My stuff’s in the trunk! God! You care more
about that car than you do about most people.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Most people just cause me trouble, but that
car always gets me out of it.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>i.d. tech</strong>: Blood?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>i.d. tech</strong>: His, I guess…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You guess?</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Hi. This is Jimmy. I’m not here
right now…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hello! I’m here. Hang on a minute!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Louise! Where are you? Are you alright?
Honey…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Hi. I’m okay. How are you? Long time no
see.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Louise, honey… Where are you? You sound
funny.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I am funny. I’m real funny.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you in town? This sounds long
distance.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No, I’m out of town. I’m in… I’m in real
deep shit, Jimmy. Deep shit Arkansas.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Louise, just tell me what the hell is going
on here! I come back, nobody knows where you are. Is Thelma with you?
Darryl’s been callin’ here every half-hour sayin’ he’s gonna kill you
both when you get back, he’s goin’ nuts. I don’t envy her if she is.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where’d y’all go?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Fishing. Look, Jimmy… I need you to help me.
This is serious. I’m in trouble and I need you to help me. Can you do
that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes, yes, darlin’. I can help you. Tell me
where you are.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I have a savings account with about
sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won’t be able to get
it out, but I’m good for it. I need that money. Can you wire me the
sixty-seven hundred dollars and I’ll pay you back? Please, I’m
desperate.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Something real bad has happened and I can’t
tell you what, just that it’s bad and I did it and I can’t undo it. Can
you help me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Of course. Of course! Where? Can’t I bring it
to you? For God’s sake, baby, please, just tell me what’s happened, what
could possibly be so bad?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Christ, sure… yes!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma
City,</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re in Oklahoma?!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Louise, let me call you back after I wire it,
so you’ll know which office to go to.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Can’t it go to any office?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, for that much money I have to tell them
exactly which office. I know, I’ve had to have money wired to me on the
road. And there has to be a code word or they won’t give it to you. I’ll
have to tell you the code.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Tell me now.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Call me back.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Okay. I’ll call you back. In an hour. Don’t
tell Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know. Call me back. Louise, I love you,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Come on, Thelma! Get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Did you finish thinking?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I think better when I drive.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: All we know is there were two women in a green
T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real
fast. We’re trying to get a make on the car, but nothin’ yet. So far, we
got nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Well, you’d best get something. Even if they
didn’t do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it. I want
somebody to at least talk to ’em. Put out an APB with a description and
see what we get back.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Is there any reason to believe they’ve left
the state?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: That’s certainly possible.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Why don’t we go ahead and let the bureau in
on this.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I have no problem with that.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Somebody’s butt is gonna bar-b-que.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Don’t get mad, Louise, but where are we
going?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oklahoma City. Jimmy’s gonna wire me some
money, and then…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell
him?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No, I didn’t tell him. And that’s something
we gotta get straight. Darryl’s been callin’, mad as a hornet, makin’
all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about
this. You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning
and he wasn’t even home. I don’t know what he’s got to be mad about. I’m
the one who should be mad.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’ve been tellin’ you that for the last ten
years.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Do you think Darryl’s having an affair?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t think Darryl is mature enough to
conduct an affair.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: But you think he fools around.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma, I’m going to Mexico. I think I can
make it in two and a half days, but I’m going to have to haul ass. Are
you up to this? I mean, I have to know. This isn’t a game. I’m in deep
shit. I gotta know what you’re gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I… I don’t know. I don’t know what you’re
askin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Don’t you fall apart on me. Goddamnit,
Thelma. Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or
some such shit, and this time… Not this time. Everything’s changed now…
Now you can do whatever you want, but I’m going to Mexico. I’m going.
Are you coming with me?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I think he does. Fool around.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Do you have a pay phone?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: ’Round the side, by the restrooms.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Louise!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Is that how you answer the phone?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I got it. I was afraid I’d missed you. I
almost couldn’t get a check cashed. It’s Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Who did it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Friend of mine, owns a club. Dickie Randall.
You’d know him if you saw him. His brother was in your class. Terry.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You didn’t say what it was for, did you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, honey. I told him I was buyin’ a car.
What is it for?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Good. That was good. Where do I go?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s a place called Shaw’s Siesta Motel. The
address is 1921 North East 23. It’s under your name.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: And what’s the mysterious code word?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Peaches.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s the code word. I miss you,
peaches.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Okay, Jimmy. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Louise?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Ma’am, are you sure you wouldn’t rather
have the large economy size?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Go call Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Call him?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Call him. Don’t tell him anything. Tell him
you’re having a wonderful time and you’ll be home tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Will I be?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t know. I won’t be.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Collect from Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Goddamnit, Thelma, where in the Sam Hill are
you?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m… I’m with Louise. We’re in the
mountains, we’re…</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What in the hell do you think you’re doing?
Have you lost your goddamn mind?! Is that it? I leave for work and you
take complete leave of your senses?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Darryl… baby… Darryl, calm down now, honey.
Please don’t get so mad. I can explain…</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Hold on. Hold on a minute, damnit.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: …only for one day and we’ll be back tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: No you won’t. You’ll be back today. Now! You
get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit. Thelma, do you
understand me?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Darryl, please… You’re my husband, not my
father, Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: That does it! That Louise is nothin’ but a
bad influence. If you’re not back here tonight, Goddamnit, Thelma… well,
I just don’t wanna say…</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Thelma?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Whoa! Excuse me! Miss, are you
alright?</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No. Thanks. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Would you mind me asking which direction
you and your friend are going? I’m trying to get back to school and my
ride fell through, so I’m kinda stuck. Are you going my way?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Umm. I think we’re going to Oklahoma City.
But I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Do you think you could… I mean, I could
help pay for gas.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ummm. Well, see, it’s not really up to me.
It’s not my car. Umm, we’ll have to ask my friend, but she’ll probably
say no. She’s a little uptight.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Well. Maybe we better not ask her. But
thank you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, we can ask her. That won’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise, this young man is on his way back to
school and needs a ride, and I thought since…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s probably not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Y’all have a nice day. Drive safe.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: See how polite he is? He was really
nice.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: You cheer up now!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I wish we could’ve brought him with us.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What did Darryl say?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: He said “Okay, Thelma. I just wanted to know
you were alright. I hope you’re havin’ a good time. You sure deserve one
after puttin’ up with me all the time. I love you, honey.”</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: How long before we’re in Goddamn Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I just don’t see what it would hurt just to
give somebody a ride. Did you see his butt? Darryl doesn’t have a cute
butt. You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m just not in the mood for
company right now. Here. Take this map. I need you to find all the
secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City. I think we should stay off
the interstates. We’re too conspicuous.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, it looks like we can get on this road
81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t want to go that way. Find a way that
we don’t have to go through Texas.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico from
Oklahoma and you don’t want to go through Texas?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You know how I feel about Texas… We’re not
going that way.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I know, Louise, but we’re running for our
lives! Don’t you think you could make an exception just this once?! I
mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is
Texas!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma! I’m not gonna talk about this! Now
find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will! You
understand?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No, Louise. How come you never said what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I… I just… I just don’t think it’s the place
I wanna get caught for doin’ something like… if you blow a guy’s head
off with his pants down, believe me, Texas is the last place you wanna
get caught! Trust me! Now, I said, I don’t wanna talk about it!!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Okay. We’ll go around Texas to get to
Mexico. This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’ll tell you what. He is gooood
lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>thelma/louise</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: So J.D., what are you studying in
school?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Human nature. I’m majoring in behavioral
science.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: And whaddya wanna be when ya grow up?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: A waiter.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What?!!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: So how come you don’t have any kids?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Darryl, that’s my husband, he says he’s not
ready. He’s still too much of a kid himself. He prides himself on being
infantile.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: He’s got a lot to be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise and Darryl don’t get along.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: That’s puttin’ it mildly.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: She thinks he’s a pig.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: He’s a real piece o’ work. I wish you could
meet him.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Did you get married real young?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Twenty-four isn’t young. I’d already been
goin’ out with him ten years when we got married. I’ve never been with
anybody but Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so, he
sounds like a real asshole.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: It’s okay. He is an asshole. Most of the
time I just let it slide.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Better slow down. That’s a cop.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Maybe you got a few too many parking
tickets?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We’ll take you on to Oklahoma City, then
you’d best be on your way.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: The prints on the trunk of the car match those
of Thelma Dickinson.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well I’ll be damned. Isn’t that strange.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: And the husband says a gun is missing. She took
a lot of stuff. It looks like she maybe planned on being gone a while.
The strange thing is, her husband said she would never touch that gun.
He got it for her ’cause he’s out late a lot, but he said she’d never
touch it, wouldn’t learn to shoot it, just left it in a drawer for
years.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What kind of gun was it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Right. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: We’re lookin’. They were on their way to some
guy’s cabin and they never showed up. We’re lookin’. We hope you’re
lookin’ too.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I just gotta run in for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You two better go on and say your
goodbyes.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Louise Elizabeth Sawyer. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Nothin’. Nothin’ came in today at all.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Nothing under peaches? Check again under
peaches.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Naw, nothin’ under peaches neither.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Did you say Peaches?! Why that’s the secret
word! Show her what she’s won, Don.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, peaches.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh my God! Jimmy! You… Oh my God! What are
you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can we get another room? Just put it on my
credit card.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: ’Round to the back.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world
are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ask me no questions, I’ll tell you no
lies.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Good answer. Same goes double for me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: This is J.D. He’s a student. We’re just
givin’ him a ride to… to here. Louise said we could bring him here and
then he’d have to go. And that’s what he’s doin’. He’s goin’. Aren’t
you, J.D.?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Yup. Thanks for the ride. You all take
care.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Yup. That’s him goin’. I love to watch him
go.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma kinda took to him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well, come on, gal, I got you a room. You can
go on in and take a nice cold shower.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Don’t mind me, Jimmy, I’m just a wild
woman.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I always knew that.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: A regular outlaw.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Let me just go in and freshen up for a
minute. I need to wash my face, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, honey. I don’t want to rush you. I just
wanna talk to you and… …be alone with you. I’ll just be in my room, 115,
you just come on down when you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ll be waiting.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I don’t care what you say about him. The boy
has got it bad.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: He’s always got it bad as long as I’m
running in the other direction. Don’t be fooled, he’s no different than
any other guy. He knows how to chase and that’s it. Once he’s caught
you, he don’t know what to do. So he runs away.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I heard that.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Our future.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: So what are you gonna tell him?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Nothing. I’m not gonna tell him a thing. The
least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already
is.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You are so sweet to that guy, you really
are. Imagine not wanting to drag him into this. He is a lucky man.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I didn’t ask him to come! It’s like I said,
Thelma, he just loves the chase.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well boy, he’s got his work cut out for him
now, don’t he?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Put a lid on it, Thelma! It’s hard enough as
it is. Just let me get this part over with. Now stay here and guard the
money. If there’s any problem I’m in room 115.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I won’t wait up.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of
loveliness, you always are.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Have another drink, Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Thelma? It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I just thought I… I know I’m supposed to be
gone, but…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’m not havin’ much luck gettin’ a ride.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, I guess I’d better…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Wait…! Um, where ya going?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I don’t know. Nowhere. What are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I don’t know. Nothin’. Took a shower.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: That sounds nice.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, you wanna use the shower?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Oh. I… where’s Louise?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: She’s off with Jimmy, that’s her
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: That’s lonely for you, I guess. I always think
of motel rooms as lonely.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh, yes, well, they can be.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the
trouble here? Tell Daddy everything.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Jimmy, my daddy’s still alive and it kind of
gives me the creeps when you do that…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, okay, just tell me what’s the
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Jimmy, I’m not gonna tell ya what the
trouble is. Someday soon you’ll understand why I can’t. But I won’t tell
ya, so don’t ask me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, peaches, okay. But can I ask you one
thing?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Does it have something to do with another
guy? Are you in love with him?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s nothin’ like that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Then what?! What, goddamnit, Louise! Where
the fuck are you going? Are you just leaving for fucking ever? What, did
you fuckin’ murder somebody or what?!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Stop it! Stop it, Jimmy, or I’ll leave right
now. I’m not kiddin’!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Alright, alright. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can I just ask you one other thing?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Will you wear this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Will you at least see how it fits?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Jimmy… it’s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You didn’t see that one comin’, did ya?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You wanna drink?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So whaddya think. I mean… I could… uh… get a
job. Of some kind. I mean you’ve been tellin’ me that for years,
right?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Why now, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ‘Cause, Louise. I don’t want to lose you. And
for some reason I get the feelin’ you’re about to split.
Permanently.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Jimmy, we’ve gone all these years… we never
made it work. We’re not gonna be able to just… I’m not… What kind of
job, honey? Can you see it. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m the one… I never made it work. I just…
It’s not that I don’t love you. It’s not that. I just never thought I’d
be thirty-six years old and I never thought… I don’t know what I
thought. What do you want, darlin’. What do you want me to do.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t know. It doesn’t even matter
anymore. I just want you to be happy… It’s not that I don’t love you
either. But Jimmy, your timing couldn’t be worse.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you just doin’ this to punish me?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Believe me, the last thing I want is for you
to get punished.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It does look good.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Faster than a speeding green T-Bird, able to
leap tall babes in a single bound…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Hi. Could I interest you in some Fuller
brushes?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Stop, stop, stop!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I am the great and powerful Oz…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: J.D.! Just tell me. I know you’re not some
schoolboy. Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’m just some guy. A guy whose parole officer
is probably having a shit fit right about now.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What?! Parole officer? You mean you’re a
criminal?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin’
parole, I haven’t done one wrong thing.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What did ya do?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’m a robber.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re a bank robber?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Nope. I’ve never robbed a bank.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I
robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed
like somethin’ I was good at so I…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No, I mean how would you do it? Do you just
sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never
got arrested for burglary. Burglary’s for chicken shits. If you’re gonna
rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to ’em and do it. Just take
the money. That’s robbery. That’s a whole ’nother deal.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Well, first you pick your place, see, then I’d
just sit back and watch it for awhile. Ya gotta wait for just the right
moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can’t be taught.
Then I’d waltz on in…</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: And I’d say, “Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
let’s see who’ll win the prize for keepin’ their cool. Simon says
everybody lie down on the floor. If nobody loses their head, then nobody
loses their head. You sir… You do the honors. Just empty that cash into
this bag and you’ll have an amazing story to tell all your friends. If
not, you’ll have a tag on your toe. You decide.” Then I’d split.
Simple.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: My gosh, you sure gentlemanly about it.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I’ve always believed if done right, armed
robbery doesn’t have to be a totally unpleasant experience.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: God. You’re a real live outlaw!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I may be the outlaw, but you’re the one
stealin’ my heart.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: And smooth, boy, you are smooth.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re kinda the best thing that’s happened
to me in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You’re a little angle, you are.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Louise? I think you are so damn beautiful. I
mean that. I always have.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I think you’re beautiful too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t worry darlin’. I’ll say I never found
you. I’ll say anything you want. We’ll find a way to get you out of
this, whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes
you say all the right stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m choking on it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Honey? Ummm… Do you want me to come with
you?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh… now… it’s probably not such a good idea
right now. I’ll… catch up with you later, on down the road.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You keep this!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Your taxi’s here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you happy, Louise? I just want you to be
happy.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m happy, sweetie. Happy as I can be.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Good thing he left when he did. We thought
we were gonna have to put out a fire.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes, baby?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Do you think you could ever shoot someone?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Do you think you could ever think of a set of
circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot
someone?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I could shoot your cousin Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Because he’s an inconsiderate asshole.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m asking you seriously, Sarah, a
stranger?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t know, honey. I guess it would
depend.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you
or one of the kids. I’m sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt
one of the children.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Yeah, I could too. But… I don’t know why I’m
even asking you this. It’s just… we can’t place anybody at the scene but
these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don’t know. I
keep hearing words – impossible – inconceivable. If just one person
would say…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Honey. Nothing’s impossible. You just don’t
shoot someone like that for no reason. Maybe he was askin’ for it.
Anyway, somebody’s husband probably got ol’ Harlan.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: That’s what everybody says. Only problem is
nobody’s husband was unaccounted for that night… Could you shoot Eddie
in the face? At point blank range?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: In the leg.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I gotta go to Little Rock.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What happened to your hair?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Nothing. It got messed up.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yes, now that you mention it. You seem
crazy. Like you’re on drugs.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, I’m not on drugs. But I might be
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t think I wanna hear what you’re gonna
tell me.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh my God, Louise!!! I can’t believe it! I
just really can’t believe it! I mean… whoa!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh, Thelma. Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I mean I finally understand what all the
fuss is about. This is just a whole ’nother ball game!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.
You’re making a spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You know, Louise, you’re supposed to be my
best friend. You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could
at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a
sexual experience that isn’t completely disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m sorry. I am happy. I’m very happy for
you. I’m glad you had a good time. It’s about time. Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Taking a shower.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You left that guy alone in the room?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Where’s the money, Thelma?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ummm… it’s on the table. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Goddamnit! I’ve never been lucky! Not one
time!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Shit. That little sonofabitch burgled me. I
don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise… It’s okay. Louise? I’m sorry. I mean
it.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s not okay, Thelma. It’s definitely not
okay. None of this is okay. What are we going to do for money? What are
we gonna buy gas with? Our good looks? I mean… Goddamn, Thelma!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Come on. Stand up! Don’t you worry about it.
I’ll take care of it. Just don’t you worry about it. Get your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Come on! Damnit, get your stuff and let’s
get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Move! Jesus Christ, take your damn time.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: As you know, we’ve tapped your phone. In the
event that she calls in.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re going to leave someone here at the house
in the event that she calls in. Someone will be here until we find
them.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: The important thing is not to let on that you
know anything. We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don’t
want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your
wife? Are you close with her?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I’m about as close as
I can be with a nut case like that.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, if she calls, just be gentle. Like you’re
happy to hear from her. You know, like you really miss her. Women love
that shit.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Eighty-eight dollars ain’t gonna make a
dent, baby girl.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Don’t worry about it. You want anything?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Drive!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Drive! Drive away!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What? You robbed the store? You robbed the
Goddamn store?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well! We needed the money! It’s not like I
killed anybody, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m sorry. Well, we need the money. Now we
have it.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh shit, Thelma!! Shit! Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Now you get a grip, Louise! Just drive us to
Goddamn Mexico, will ya!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Okay. Shit, Thelma! What’d you do? I mean,
what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, I just…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Alright, ladies and gentleman, let’s see
who’ll win the prize for keepin’ their cool. Everybody lie down on the
floor. If nobody loses their head, then nobody loses their head…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You, sir… You do the honors. Just empty that
cash into this bag and you’ll have an amazing story to tell all your
friends. If not, you’ll have a tag on your toe. You decide.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good God.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Lemme see the map.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise, you’d better slow down. I’ll just
die if we get caught over a speeding ticket.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: For the first time in my life, I wish this
car wasn’t green.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Are you sure we should be driving like this?
In broad daylight and everything?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No we shouldn’t, but I want to put some
distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oooooweee!! You shoulda seen me! Like I’d
been doin’ it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You think you’ve found your calling?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Maybe. Maybe. The call of the wild!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You’re disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Yes! I believe I am!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I swear to God, she wouldn’t tell me one
thing! Christ! You oughta try to find that kid that was with ’em.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Tell us about him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just some young guy. Around twenty years old.
Dark hair.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They said they’d picked him up along the way.
He was a student. But he didn’t look right. But he left when they got to
the motel.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you understand that you may be facing an
accessory charge?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: This is serious, son. A man is dead.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know! I’d tell you if I knew! Goddamn! I
know something happened, or she wouldn’t have left. I’m trying to
remember everything! Find that fucking kid. He probably knows
something.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: So what’s the plan, Thelma? You just gonna
stay drunk?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Try to.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Litterbug.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Aw, great. This always happens. Whenever
you’re in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Isn’t that nice? Truck drivers are always so
nice. The best drivers on the road.</p>
<p><strong>thelma/louise</strong>: Ugh!! Gross!! Oh my God! Aw, God!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ugh!! Why do they have to do that?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: They think we like it. Maybe they think it
turns us on.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Is this the guy you saw them with?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, happy day.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You gotta be kiddin’ me. They picked up a
murderer?!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Armed robber.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’re flying him here right now. He was
picked up this morning for parole violation. They also found about six
grand on him, so he probably knocked over something while he was out
there. They can drop him by here for questioning. I’m so happy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How much cash did he have?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I want you to call Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: To find out if he knows anything. If you
think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told
him and the phone is probably tapped.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think
so?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery,
Thelma!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Murder one! God, Louise, can’t we even say
it was self-defense?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: But it wasn’t! We got away! We were walkin’
away!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: They don’t know that! It was just you and me
there. I’ll say he raped me and you had to shoot him! I mean, it’s
almost the truth!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Why not?!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No physical evidence. We can’t prove he did
it. We probably can’t even prove he touched you by now.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: God. The law is some tricky shit, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: How do you know ’bout all this stuff
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Besides, what do we say about the robbery?
No excuse for that. No such thing as justifiable robbery.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Alright, Louise!</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Who’s the nut?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: That’s Thelma Dickinson’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Aw, God.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Alright! She did good! Didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Well, son, she’s doin’ a damn sight better ’n
you right now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where did you get $6600.00 in cash?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: A friend.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he
personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise
Sawyer. Do you know her too?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Umm, yes. She was driving.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.
He also says that at that time he met a man. He identified you through a
series of mug shots. He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed
“close.” Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: You might say we had a meeting of the minds,
yes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Did you know that Mrs. Dickinson and Miss
Sawyer are wanted in connection with a murder?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Did either of them ever indicate that they
might be running from the Law?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Now that you mention it, they might have been
a little bit jumpy.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You know what? You’re starting to irritate
me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Do you mind if I have a word with him alone for
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: What?! What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Son, I gotta feelin’ about somethin’ and I just
wanna ask your opinion. Do you think Thelma Dickinson would have
committed armed robbery if you hadn’t taken all their money?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Cat got your tongue?</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: How do you know I took it? How do you know
they didn’t just give it to me?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: There’s two girls out there that had a chance,
they had a chance…! And you blew it for ‘em. Now they’ve gotten in some
serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it,
I’m gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to
them. I’ve got no feelin’ for you. But I may be the only person in the
world who gives a rat’s ass what happens to them and you’re either gonna
tell me every damn thing you know, so there’s a small chance I can
actually do them some good, or I’m gonna be all over you like a fly on
shit for the rest of your natural life. Your misery is gonna be my
goddamn mission in life. That’s a sincere promise.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Now, for one thing, you violated your parole
two days out. And you know Judge Hainey. He hates this sort of thing.
Once he gets wind of this, he’s gonna blow sky high. And then when he
finds out that you’re a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery,
well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at
least the remaining eight, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, definitely.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: Okay. Is somebody gonna write this down?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Mr. Dickinson, if you’ll just hang on, I want a
word with you and then we’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>j.d.</strong>: I like your wife.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Come back here, you little shit!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Fill her up. There’s a phone right over
there.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Let’s get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m not kidding, Thelma. If you think he
knows, even if you’re not sure, hang up.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Darryl. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Thelma! Hello!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: He knows.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What?! All I said was hello.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You got any change?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Darryl, this is Louise. Are the police
there?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Uh, no! No, why would any police be here?
Hey, where are you girls, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Let me talk to whoever’s in charge
there?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: What are you talking about, Louise?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Hello, Miss Sawyer. I’m Hal Slocumbe, Chief
Investigator, Homicide, Arkansas State Police. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’ve been better.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You girls are in some hot water.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yes, sir. I know.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You’re both okay? Neither one of you hurt?
You’re bein’ careful with that gun?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We’re both fine.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Good. You wanna tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Sure. Maybe over coffee sometime. I’ll
buy.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I just want you to know, neither one of you are
charged with murder yet. You’re still just wanted for questioning.
Although, now, Mrs. Dickinson’s wanted in Oklahoma for armed
robbery.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No kiddin’. Listen, we gotta go. I’ll call
you back, all right?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Miss Sawyer, I don’t think y’all are gonna make
it to Mexico. We should talk. Please. I wanna to help you.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: That J.D. kid is a little shit.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: How’d they find out we’re going to Mexico,
Thelma, how they know that?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You told that thievin’ little shit where we
were goin’?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to
look us up. I asked him not to tell. I didn’t think he would tell
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Why not?! What’s he got to lose? Other than
my life’s savings, that is. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m sorry. I mean I…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Goddamnit, Thelma! Let me explain something
to you. Right now we have only two things goin’ for us. One, nobody
knows where we are, and two, nobody knows where we’re going. Now, one of
our things that was going for us is gone!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Just stop talkin’ to people, Thelma! Stop
bein’ so open! We’re fugitives now. Let’s behave that way!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise? Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Just past Boise City.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Idaho?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oklahoma, Thelma. We’re crossing into New
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I always wanted to see New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Now what what?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Whaddo we do?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh, I don’t know, Thelma. I guess maybe we
could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for
mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on
Saturdays. Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m not suggestin’ that! I’m not goin’ back.
No matter what happens. So don’t worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Can I ask you kind of a weird question?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Of all the things in the world that scare
you, what’s the worst thing that scares you the most?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You mean now or before?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Before.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I guess I always thought the worst thing
that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy
apartment with one of those little dogs.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What little dogs?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You know those little dogs you see people
with?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Like a Chihuahua?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Those, too, but you know those little hairy
ones? Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned
teeth?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh yeah. You mean Peek-a-poos.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yeah. Those. That always put the fear of God
in me. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old
with Darryl was kinda startin’ to get to me.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I mean, look how different he looks just
since high school. It’s bad enough I have to get old, but doin’ it with
Darryl around is only gonna make it worse. I mean, I don’t think he’s
gonna be very nice about it.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, now, maybe you won’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Always lookin’ on the bright side, aren’t
ya?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: This is so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Gosh. It sure is.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I always wanted to travel. I just never got
the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, you got it now.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Look! Look who it is, Thelma. I’ll be
darned. What’s he doin’ way out here.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Just ignore him.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh, Christ. I hate this guy.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We should have just ignored him.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Nothing. It’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What? What’s not funny, Thelma!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Okay, but… I can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Harlan.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?! What about him?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Just the look on his face when you… …it’s
not funny.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Now, Thelma, that is not…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Boy, he wasn’t expectin’ that!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Suck my dick… Boom!!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma. It’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: It happened to you… didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it! Thelma, I’m
not kidding! Don’t you even…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: …in Texas… didn’t it? That’s what happened…
Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m warning you, Thelma. You better drop it
right now! I don’t want to talk about it!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Okay, Louise… It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Shit! Thelma, wake up! Shit! We’re gettin’
pulled over!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What! What! Oh shit! Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What do we do? What do you want to do?!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t know! Shit! Let’s just play it by
ear. He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Please, God, please don’t let us get caught.
Please, please, please…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Turn off your engine.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Hello, Officer. Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: You wanna let me see your license,
please?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: You wanna take it out of your wallet,
please?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I told you to slow down. Hell, Officer, I
told her to slow down.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: About how fast was I going?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: About a hundred and ten. You wanna step
out of the car, please?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Is this your car?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: You wanna come with me, please? Walk
around and get in the car, please.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: In the back?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Front.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Am I in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: As far as I’m concerned, yes, ma’am, you
are.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Officer, I am so sorry about this. Could you
let go of that?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I really, really apologize, but please put
your hands on the steering wheel. See, if you get on that radio, you’re
gonna find out that we’re wanted in two states and probably considered
armed and dangerous, at least I am, then our whole plan would be shot to
hell. Louise, take his gun.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I am really sorry about this.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us
would have ever pulled a stunt like this. But if you ever met my
husband, you’d know why I just can… You wanna step out of the car,
please? You wanna put your hands on your head, please? Louise, shoot the
radio.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Shoot the radio!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: The police radio, Louise! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You wanna step to the back of the car,
please. Louise, bring the keys.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Open the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You wanna step into the trunk, please?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Ma’am, please… I got kids… a wife…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You do? Well, you’re lucky. You be sweet to
’em. Especially your wife. My husband wasn’t sweet to me and look how I
turned out. Now go on, get in there.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Air holes.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Hit it.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I know it’s crazy, Louise, but I just feel
like I’ve got a knack for this shit.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Drive like hell.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s just not working like this. We gotta do
something. It’d be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but
Jesus, Hal, this is makin’ us look bad. I don’t know… maybe they’re not
movin’. Maybe that little creep lied.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: He’s got nothin’ to gain by lyin’. Nothin’ at
all. He already got all their money. I just don’t know what we’re
dealin’ with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide
Teletype. Let’s just wait it out a little longer. She said she was gonna
call back. Let’s just sit tight.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We don’t have a whole lotta choice, do we? I
can’t figure out if they’re real smart or just really, really lucky.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It don’t matter. Brains will only get you so
far and luck always runs out.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise… are we still going to Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Then aren’t we going in the wrong
direction?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, I figure if you take a state
policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk,
it’s best to just get on out of the state if you can.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Just asking.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t want to see any more beef jerky. I
mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It’s
drivin’ me crazy. The whole car smells like it.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: It’s good. It’s what the pioneers ate.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t care what the damn pioneers ate. You
just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: And I don’t want any more Wild Turkey,
either. It’s burning a hole in my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Okay, okay… I’ve got some tequila. You want
some tequila?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Yeah, you want it?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: It’s in here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Shit. I’m gettin’ tired.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I think I’ve really fucked up. I think I’ve
got us in a situation where we could both get killed. Why didn’t we just
go straight to the police.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You know why. You already said.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What’d I say again?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Nobody would believe us. We’d still get in
trouble. We’d still have our lives ruined. And you know what else?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: That guy was hurtin’ me. And if you hadn’t
come out when you did, he’d a hurt me a lot worse. And probably nothin’
woulda happened to him. ‘Cause everybody did see me dancin’ with him all
night. And they woulda made out like I asked for it. And my life woulda
been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now. At least now I’m havin’
fun. And I’m not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I’m only sorry that
it was you that did it and not me. And if I haven’t, I wanna take this
time to thank you, Louise. Thank you for savin’ my ass.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I said all that?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No, Louise, you said the first part. I said
all the rest.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Let me speak to… Slocumbe.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She wants to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Hello, Louise.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: How are things goin’ out there?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect
goin’ here or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You’re still with us though. You’re somewhere
on the face of the earth?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, we’re not in the middle of nowhere,
but we can see it from here.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I swear. Louise, I almost feel like I know
you.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well. You don’t.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You’re gettin’ in deeper every moment you’re
gone.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Would you believe me if I told you this
whole thing is an accident?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I do believe you. That’s what I want everybody
to believe. Trouble is, it doesn’t look like an accident and you’re not
here to tell me about it… I need you to help me here.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Did Harlan Puckett…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You want to come on in?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Then I’m sorry. We’re gonna have to charge you
with murder. Now, do you want to come out of this alive?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You know, certain words and phrases just
keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search,
life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come
out alive? I don’t know. Let us think about that.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Louise, I’ll do anything. I know what’s makin’
you run. I know what happened to you in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Come on, Louise. Don’t blow it. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Max. You gotta take me there! I’m… I’m the only
one she’s ever talked to. I don’t want anybody losin’ their heads. You
know what happens. The volume gets turned way up and the next thing you
know those girls are gonna get shot.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay, Hal, okay.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yes, Thelma?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re not gonna give up on me, are ya?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re not gonna make some deal with that
guy, are you? I mean, I just wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No, Thelma. I’m not gonna make any
deals.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I can understand if you’re thinkin’ about
it. I mean, in a way, you’ve got something to go back for. I mean Jimmy
and everything.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Thelma, that is not an option.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: But I don’t know… something’s crossed over
in me and I can’t go back. I mean, I just couldn’t live…</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I know. I know what you mean. I don’t wanna
end up on the damn Geraldo Show.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: He said they’re charging us with murder.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Eeuww.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: And we have to decide whether we want to
come out of this dead or alive.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Gosh, didn’t he say anything positive at
all?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise, do you think we should change cars,
get another car?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Sure… You know how to hotwire a car?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Well, let me know when you figure it
out.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You awake?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You could call it that. My eyes are
open.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Me too. I feel awake.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Wide awake. I don’t remember ever feelin’
this awake. Everything looks different. You know what I mean. I know you
know what I mean. Everything looks new. Do you feel like that? Like
you’ve got something to look forward to?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We’ll be drinkin’ margaritas by the sea,
Mamasita.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We can change our names.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We can live in a hacienda.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I wanna get a job. I wanna work at Club
Med.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think
that cop can come up with to beat that?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: It’d have to be pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It would have to be pretty damn good.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We should head a little further in. There’s
not that many roads in this state. I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere
not so close to New Mexico. They probably wanna kill us in New
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re drivin’.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh my God! Louise! Look! Look! See if that’s
him!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s him. He’s got California plates. It’s
the same guy.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Pass him!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Hi there! You alright?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We’re fine! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Grrrreat!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Follow us.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Fresno.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We been seein’ you all along the way.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Yeah. I been seein’ you, too.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We think you have really bad manners.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We were just wonderin’ where you think you
get off behavin’ like that to women you don’t even know.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: What? What are you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You know good and damn well what I’m talkin’
about.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I mean really! That business with your
tongue. What is that? That’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: And, oh my God, that other thing, that
pointing to your lap? What’s that supposed to mean exactly? Does that
mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Does that mean suck my dick?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: You women are crazy!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We think you should apologize.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: I’m not apologizing for shit!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Say you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Say you’re sorry or we’ll make you fuckin’
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Oh, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You probably even called us beavers on your
CB radio, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Yeah… sure did.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Damn. I hate that! I hate bein’ called a
beaver, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Are you going to apologize or not?</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Oh goddamn!! You bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: You fucking bitch! Aaaaaaarrrgghh!!! You’re
gonna have to pay for that!!! I’m gonna make you pay for that!! You hear
me??!!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Hey. Where’d you learn to shoot like
that?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Texas… You were right about what happened to
me there.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You know what’s happened, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We’ve gone insane.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: …Abducted… shot up the car… stole the
officer’s weapon… tanker… blown up… terrorized…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re not even going to believe this.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh shit. Louise… Do you think he saw us?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I don’t know, but let’s get off.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Is your seat belt on?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for
what to do if we get caught.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Yeah, right. We’re not gonna get caught.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: …requesting assistance. In pursuit of
a green T-Bird, 1966 license, seven, one, nine, William, Zebra,
Adam…</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Roger. Be advised… …armed and extremely
dangerous…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: How far are we from Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: About two hundred and fifty miles.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: How long do you think that’ll take?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: We’re going to Mexico!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Uh oh. There’s another one.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Did you see that guy?! He was right in the
middle of the road!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?! What d’you think?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We probably shoulda filled up the car before
we blew up that truck.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: They’ll probably catch us when we have to
stop for gas!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I know this whole thing was my fault. I know
it is.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: There’s one thing you oughta understand by
now, Thelma, it’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise… no matter what happens, I’m glad I
came with you.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You too, sweetie, the best.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I guess I went a little crazy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: No… You’ve always been crazy. This is just
the first chance you’ve had to really express yourself.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I guess everything from here on in is going
to be pretty shitty.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Unbearable, I’d imagine.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I guess everything we’ve got to lose is
already gone anyway.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: How do you stay so positive?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Louise!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What in the hell is that up there?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Where?!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Way up ahead!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Oh my God!!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What in the hell is it?!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s the Goddamn Grand Canyon!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Isn’t it beautiful?!!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: It’s grand!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: God! It looks like the Army!</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: All this for us?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Hey! Don’t let them shoot those girls. This is
too much. They got guns pointed at ’em!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The women are armed, Hal. This is standard. Now
you stay calm here. These boys know what they’re doin’.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: This is the Arizona Highway Patrol. You are
under arrest. You are considered armed and dangerous. Any failure to
obey any command will be considered an act of aggression against us.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: We’re not giving up, Thelma.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Then let’s not get caught.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What are you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Go?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>arizona cop #1</strong>: …heard they shot a cop.</p>
<p><strong>arizona cop #2</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>arizona cop #1</strong>: With his own gun. Put him in the
trunk and blew him away…</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: Turn off the engine and place your hands in
the air!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Max! Let me talk to ’em! I can’t believe this!
You’ve gotta do something here!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m sorry to bother you, I know you’re real
busy right now, but how many times, Max? How many times has that woman
gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you
won’t even do that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get a hold of yourself! You are way out of your
jurisdiction, now come on! Calm down! Don’t make me sorry I let you
come!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Shit! I can’t fucking believe this!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>arizona cop #1</strong>: What in the hell?!</p>
<p><strong>arizona #2</strong>: The son of a bitch is in my way!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You, too, sweetie, the best.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: B.B. King song entitled “Better Not Look
Down” begins. It is very upbeat.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Hit it.</p>
<p><strong>b.b. king song</strong>: I’ve been around, I’ve seem some
things, People movin’ faster than the speed of sound, faster than a
speedin’ bullet. People livin’ like Superman, all day and all night. I
won’t say if it’s wrong or I won’t say if it’s right. I’m pretty fast
myself. But I do have some advice to pass along, right here in the words
to this song…</p>
<p><strong>b.b. king song</strong>: Better not look down, if you wanna
keep on flyin’. Put the hammer down, keep it full speed ahead. Better
not look back or you might just wind up cryin’. You can keep it movin’
if you don’t look down…</p>
