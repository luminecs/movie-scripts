<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Joyce… Joyce?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What’s wrong, Harvey? What are you doing
up?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes
about himself in a comic book? Or am I just – am I just a character in
that book?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: If I die, will ‘dat character keep goin’? Or
will he just fade away…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Trick or treat!!</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Well, look at this! All the superheroes
on the porch! Ain’t that cute.</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: We got Superman here, Batman, his
sidekick ROBIN, ohh, The Green Lantern even…</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: And what about you young man?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What about what?</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Who are you supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m Harvey Pekar .</p>
<p><strong>housewife</strong>: Harvey Pekar? That doesn’t sound like a
super hero to me…</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Pecker, Pecker…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I ain’t no super hero, lady. I’m just a kid
from the neighborhood, alright?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Ahh, forget this…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Why is everybody so stoopid?</p>
<p><strong>credit sequence - animated sequence intercut harvey
walking</strong>: WITH COMIC BOOK PANELS OF THE CARTOON HARVEY IN
ACTION. This is not your typical super-hero stuff.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Okay. We’re throwing a lot at ya here,
so lemme step in an’ help ya catch up. This is the story about comic
books, an’ a guy who made a whole life outta them. You could even say
comics saved his life. This guy here, he’s our man, Harvey Pekar – all
grown up and goin’ nowhere. Although he’s a pretty scholarly cat, he
never got much of a formal education. For the most part, he’s lived in
shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second
disastrous marriage. So if yer lookin’ for romance or escapism or some
fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? Ya got the wrong movie.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Doc, you gotta help me. My old lady’s
dumping me ‘cause I can’t talk. She says I’m a social embarrassment. Now
that she’s got her PhD, she’s some hot shit academic star an’ I’m
nuthin’ but a file clerk with nothin’ ta say an’ no voice ta say it. But
me bein’ a file clerk was fine when I wrote the damn check for her
tuition –</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Harvey, stop talking please, and open
wide.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I just don’t get it… We were doin’ okay for
a while. Then we took that stupid belated honeymoon. I started losin’ my
voice on the plane. Can you believe that… On the plane, doc?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Bad timing, I guess. Now please say “Ah,”
Mr. Pekar.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: “Ahhh.” “Ahhh” ruined the trip. I got crazy,
started to worry my voice would never come back. I mean, my wife didn’t
know me so long before we got hitched. What if she totally forgets what
I’m like? Man, it’s torture –</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What? Is it bad, doc?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: It’s not good.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: It’s cancer? First I got marital problems
and now yer tellin’ me I got throat cancer? Omigod…</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Harvey, calm down. It’s not cancer. You
have a nodule on your vocal chords. Probably from screaming and yelling
too much. And if you don’t stop talking and give it a rest, you’re gonna
lose your voice completely.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Whew… Okay, okay. But fer how long?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: A few months.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Months!!</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: See? More of that and you’ll do permanent
damage. Now go home, keep your mouth shut, and hopefully we won’t have
to operate.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hi Harvey. You weren’t in work today. Are you
okay, Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I’m heading downtown to the White Castle.
Wanna come, Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>spanish woman #1</strong>: I already told you, I’m waiting
for a call!</p>
<p><strong>spanish woman #2</strong>: Oh yeah? Since when is this your
private office?!</p>
<p><strong>spanish woman #1</strong>: Since you can kiss my ass.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: SPANISH WOMAN #1’s MOUTH</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Look at ‘em yakkin’. How do they do it?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: They all make it seem so easy.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Here’s our man walking home from the
doctor’s. He’s got the weight of the world on him. And fer what, really?
‘Cause his throat’s a little screwy? Man, people in India are starvin’
to death every day. His problems are nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Still, he can’t help feelin’ paranoid,
like some supernatural force is conspiring against him to rob him of his
voice.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Maybe his old lady will go easy on him
today, when she sees how upset he is.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ay… What is this?</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Exactly what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin’ me?! Fer
what? Ah, shit!</p>
<p><strong>lana</strong>: Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn’t working
for me anymore. Cleveland’s not working for me anymore. I gotta get out
of here before I kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Please! Wait, honey… Just listen to what I
got to say…</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Here’s our man – yeah alright, here’s
me – or the guy playin’ me, anyway, though he don’t look nothin’ like
me, but whatever. So it’s a few months later an’ I’m workin’ my flunky,
file-clerk gig at the V.A. Hospital. My voice still ain’t back yet.
Things seem like they can’t get any worse…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Thank you, Harvey dear.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Plebeian… where the hell did she get that
shit?</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Avoid the reeking herd! Shun the polluted
flock! Live like that stoic bird, The eagle of the rock!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Huh? Oh. Hiya, Mr. Boats.</p>
<p><strong>boats</strong>: You know what that means, son?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah. It’s from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie poem.
It means stay away from the crowds of common ordinary people an’ do yer
own thing.</p>
<p><strong>boats</strong>: Nope, it means don’t compromise yourself for
women. Ain’t gonna do you no good! Get away from ’em as soon as you
can!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Well I ain’t got no woman now. So I’m living
like the stoic bird, man.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: The only way to live, son.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Look at that fool over there. What’s he
wearing?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Huh? That’s an A.M.-F.M. radio he’s
listening to… They got ’em fixed up now like a pair of earmuffs.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: MMPH! Isn’t that somethin! People have
gone crazy. They’ll buy any kinda junk! Probably listening to that loud
rock stuff. Junk, junk, it’s all junk!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Well, I don’t know. Rock music’s got some
good qualities. I mean it ain’t jazz or nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Say, when you gonna bring me in some good
records? Some Nat “King” Cole with Strings…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I don’t got any of that, Mr. Boats…</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Yeah, you got it… You’re keepin’ it at
home, though! You won’t turn loose the good stuff… You just sell the
junk!</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa. Men have named
you.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: In the early sixties I was with some
buddies at a junk sale looking for some choice sides when I met this
shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb. You know the guy;
Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural an’ all – they made a movie about him,
too.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: C’mon, Harv. You dig Jay McShann. You gonna
buy that or what?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I don’t know, Marty. It’s got a lamination
crack in it… A quarter. Maybe I can get him down.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You are one cheap bastard Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah, I know I’m tight, man, but I live on a
government wage.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: You collect Jay McShann, man?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah, man. How ’bout you?</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Yeah but most of my records are back in
Philly.</p>
<p><strong>pahls</strong>: Harv, meet my buddy Bob Crumb. He just moved
to town. He’s an artist at American Greeting Card Company.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: That’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>pahls</strong>: You should see his comics, Harv. They are
outta sight.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah? I’m into comics myself.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: So Crumb showed me this comic book
novel he was working on – THE BIG YUM YUM BOOK. I’d never seen anything
like it.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: It’s terrific, man! I really dig your
work.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: This PETER WHEAT book is by Walt Kelly… It’s
pretty rare.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah? Can I get good bread for it?</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Nah! Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Listen man, let’s get back to your book.
What are you gonna do with it?</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: I hadn’t thought about it. It’s just an
exercise.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: It’s more than an exercise. It’s breaking
ground, man. There’s some wild shit in here.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: You’re spitting on me, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Crumb and I hung out a lot back then.
We had records and comics in common.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Check it out, man. Pretty scary.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah, ya don’t know the half of it.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Eventually people got hip to Crumb’s
art work and he started hangin’ out with a Bohemian crowd. After a
while, he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to San Francisco
where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: He’d come back ta Cleveland every few
years, an’ people’d treat him like a celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Once he came to visit when I was really
feelin’ bad. It was right around the time of my throat operation, an’
right after my second wife left me. At first it was pretty weird. I
mean, here my life was falling apart an’ everything was going great for
him. I was on my second divorce an’ he was a big hit with the chicks. I
was a nothin’ file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I dunno, man. On the one hand most women
gettin’ graduate degrees wouldn’t give a guy like me the time a’ day.
An’ she married me an’ everything, so I gotta give her some kinda
credit. But then she got so mean to me in the end. An’ it ain’t like I
tried t’keep her captive or anything like that, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: An’ then on top of it I lost my voice for
three months. I still sound like shit, but before I had nothin’. Man,
talk about hell. I started forgettin’ what I sound like, y’know? So I
started writin’ stuff down – stories an’ things, my points a’ view,
ideas. I even published a couple jazz record reviews. I guess that ended
up bein’ a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: But don’t think I buy into this “growth”
crap. Everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t’grow, an’
all that clich�d stuff. I’ve had enough bad experiences and growth to
last me plenty. Right now, I’d be glad to trade some growth for
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So how long are ya stayin’ in Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this chick in
New York. And I’m really busy with the comic book stuff. It’s good bread
and all man but I’m getting fed up with the whole scene.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What are ya talkin’ about? Yer makin’ a good
living doin’ yer art? Sheesh. How many guys get that lucky in their
life, huh?</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Yeah, I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ya know man, people are startin’ to know the
name “Crumb.” When you croak you’re gonna leave something behind.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Yeah, my ashes and some crappy doodles. It’s
not like I’m Blind Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: C’mon, man. It sure beats workin’ a gig like
mine – being a nobody flunky and sellin’ records on the side for a
buck.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Yeah, well that’s true…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>angle on folder</strong>: It is marked, “CHARLIE
MARSHALL.”</p>
<p><strong>angle on harvey</strong>: He swallows hard as he reads about
Charlie’s small, invisible and now vanished life… He tosses the folder
back onto the pile.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m starvin’.</p>
<p><strong>style comic panel depicting the exact same scenario. a
bubble</strong>: appears over CARTOON HARVEY’S head revealing his
thoughts. It reads: “Pickin’ the right check-out line is an art… There’s
a lot of things you gotta consider.”</p>
<p><strong>old jewish lady</strong>: Listen, goily, dese glasses are six
for $2.00 because I couldn’t carry twelf… But I vanted twelf so today
I’m buying six more… But you should only charge me $1.50 for dem… It’s
ok, you can esk de meneger.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Frank! I need a price check.</p>
<p><strong>suddenly, the right side of the screen becomes
fully</strong>: ANIMATED… Instead of still comic panels with balloons,
the Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.</p>
<p><strong>cartoon harvey</strong>: Man, Old Jewish Ladies will argue
forever with a cashier about anything. Get behind them in a line an’ yer
gonna wait forever!</p>
<p><strong>cartoon harvey</strong>: I mean, I’m a yid myself, an’ the
women in my family are like that… But I never got used to it… I may be
cheap, but I got limits!</p>
<p><strong>old jewish lady</strong>: Please. Let me ’splain von more
time.</p>
<p><strong>cartoon harvey</strong>: Wake up! You’re whole life’s gettin’
eaten away by this kinda crap! What kind of existence is this? Is this
all a workin’ stiff like you can expect? Ya gonna suffer in silence fer
the rest a’ yer life?! Or ya gonna make a mark. Huh? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Shit. Work.</p>
<p><strong>mattress guy #1</strong>: So how smart is she?</p>
<p><strong>mattress guy #2</strong>: I dunno. I guess she’s about
average.</p>
<p><strong>mattress guy #1</strong>: Average? Hey, man. Average is
dumb!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: See, ever since I read your stuff, man I’ve
been thinking I could write comic book stories that were different from
anything being done.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m thinkin’, the guys who do animal comics
and super-hero stuff are really limited ’cause they gotta try to appeal
to kids. And underground comics like yours have been really subversive
or opened things up politically. But there is still plenty more ta be
done with ’em, too, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Pass me the ketchup?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I mean with pictures and words, it could be
more of an art form. Like those French movies are. Or De Sica over in
Italy, y’know?… So I tried writin’ some things about real life. Stuff
the everyman’s gotta deal with.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: These are about you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Er, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: You turned yourself into a comic hero?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Sorta, yeah. But no idealized shit. No phony
bullshit. The real thing, y’know? Ordinary life is pretty complex
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: These are really good, Harv.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Really? Ya think so?</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I dig it. Can
I take them home and illustrate them?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Wow!!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: You’d do that for me, man? That’d be great!
I can’t draw a straight line!</p>
<p><strong>crumb</strong>: Hey, what’s up with your voice, Harv? All of
a sudden it sounds fine.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I don’t know, man! I guess you cured me!</p>
<p><strong>a glossy, full-color comic book featuring the two
mattress</strong>: GUYS: Scrawled across the top in big red letters
reads, “AMERICAN SPLENDOR. Vol. #1” A man’s finger points to the words,
“All Stories by Harvey Pekar. Art by R. Crumb.” The comic book sits atop
a table in the dreary snack room.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: See that? All stories by yours truly.</p>
<p><strong>ww ii vet patient</strong>: Hot off the presses, huh? We got
a regular Hemingway here.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: No way, Jack, I don’t go in for that macho
crap.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #3</strong>: I didn’t know you could draw, Pekar.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Nah! I don’t draw. I just write the stories.
A buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Harvey, am I in here? You promised I would be
in here.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah! Yeah! You’re in there, alright? Jeez,
Toby.</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Let me see this.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Mr. Boats, it’s not polite to grab things.
Next time –</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Son, you done good. Ya know, I was up in
Toronto a few weeks back an’ I saw the Red Chinese Ballet…</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Now that was beautiful. The way those
people were dancing together. Those Chinese work hard. I tell ya, they
work hard – Where is everybody goin’?</p>
<p><strong>mr. boats</strong>: Where these sickly men rushin’ off to?
They ain’t goin’ nowhere for now. Maybe not for a long time. But damn if
they ain’t in a rush to get there.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey look guys, here comes Captain
America.</p>
<p><strong>pahls</strong>: You gonna hang with the boys now that yer a
comic book star?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Cut it out. Man, I ain’t nothin’ yet
compared to Bob Crumb.</p>
<p><strong>guy #3</strong>: Ah, listen to him. One lousy comic book and
he wants to be Crumb.</p>
<p><strong>pahls</strong>: Hey Harvey, if ya wanna make comics for
adults, ya oughtta put some dirty stuff in it.</p>
<p><strong>guy #3</strong>: Yeah, you can write about Marty’s sex
life.</p>
<p><strong>guy #3</strong>: Right Marty? I heard ya went out with Bonnie
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>pahls</strong>: Yeah. Howdja do? Wudja git offa her?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ah, lousy. All’s I got wuz armaround.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Here’s our man eight comics later, a
brand new decade, same old bullshit. Yeah sure, he gets lots of
recognition for his writin’ now. Sure his comics are praised by all the
important media types tellin’ people what to think. But so what? It’s
not like he makes a livin’ at it like Bob Crumb. He can’t go an’ quit
his day job or nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Who am I kiddin’. Truth is I’d be lost
without my work routine.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I got a job… I got a job…</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: So – to stave off desperation and
feelings of uselessness – I resigned myself to a menial existence. But
hey, maybe the guy who’s had a happy life feels worse just before he
dies than th’ guy who had a sad one. Or, maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I
just needed a woman.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hi, Harvey. Do you want these gourmet jelly
beans? I gave up sweets for lent.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Huh? Sure, I’ll take ’em.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey, watermelon. That’s pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I recommend the pi�a coladas. They are
excellent and very authentic tasting.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey Toby, can you eat lentils during
lent?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Sure. I don’t see why not. You can’t eat meat
on certain days, but lentils should be acceptable anytime.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ya think there’s any connection between
lentils and lent?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I don’t think so but I’ll ask Sister Mary Fred
at church on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Sister Mary Fred, huh? Is she cute? Sounds
kinda mannish but who am I to be picky.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Harvey, you’re funny. She’s a nun.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So what? Maybe she became a nun because she
couldn’t get a guy.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Harvey, she became a nun because she had a
higher calling.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Higher calling. That is such a crock of
shit. I don’t know why you waste your time prayin’ anyway.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Well, Harvey, I like the ritual. And I’m a
very spiritual person. You know, you should try believing in something
bigger than yourself. It might cheer you up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What? Do I seem depressed, Toby?</p>
<p><strong>bob the director</strong>: Cut!</p>
<p><strong>bob the director</strong>: Okay, that was great. The bakery
scene is next…</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: My loneliness was unbearable, man.
Weekends were the worst. Sometimes in my sleep, I’d feel a body next to
me like an amputee feels a phantom limb.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Sure my comics were bringin’ me
notoriety, but my personal life was in shambles. I thought a little
attention would make me feel better. It only made me feel worse.</p>
<p><strong>counter girl #1</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah! I’ll have two crullers, a jelly donut
with powdered sugar… And you got any “day old bread”?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hey, you’re Harvey Pekar.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Alice Quinn. From school.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Oh yeah. College. We had a couple lit
classes together.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What happened to you? You just disappeared
after one semester.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I know, man. I got good grades and all but
there was this required math class. I can’t do math, an’ that required
class hangin’ over my head made me crazy. Eventually the pressure got to
be too much.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well, you’re doing okay anyway. I heard all
about your jazz reviews and your comics.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ya did?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Sure, you’re famous. Meanwhile I got my
degree but I’m just a plain old wife and mother.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah. I’m not doing as great as ya think. My
second wife divorced me and I work at a dead end job as a file clerk.
Sometimes I hang out with the guys on the corner but most of the time I
just stay home by myself and read.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re luckier than you think. My husband and
kids make it impossible for me to cuddle up with a good book.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m reading this book by Dreiser now –</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That’s one of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I hope it don’t end like so many a’ those
naturalist novels… With someone getting crushed ta earth by forces he
can’t control.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. It’s
certainly not a Hollywood happy ending, but it’s pretty truthful. Which
is rare these days…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: This is me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Nice car. I don’t have one yet.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Can I give ya a lift somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Nah. It’s a nice day. I’ll just walk.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well, we should have you over sometime for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Sure, I’d be glad t’come. But if you really
wanna do me a favor, introduce me to some a’ your single girlfriends. I
bet they’re all smart like you. I’m no catch, though, so I’ll take
anything you can get me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’ll work on it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Nice seeing ya Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: When I got home, I finished reading
JENNIE GERHARDT. It was real good, way better than I expected. That
Alice wuz right.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Sure Lester – the main character –
croaks in the end, but at least he’s old and dies a natural dignified
death.</p>
<p><strong>the camera travels around the room to find</strong>: Harvey
again, now silhouetted in the door frame, still clutching the book and
obsessed by his thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: I was more alone that weekend than any.
All I did was think about JENNIE GERHARDT an’ Alice Quinn an’ all the
decades of people I have known.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: The more I thought, the more I felt
like cryin’; Life seemed so sweet an’ so sad an’ so hard t’let go of in
the end.</p>
<p><strong>the camera travels a final time to find</strong>: Harvey
sprawled across his couch. But he’s not asleep; he’s still obsessing.
The book lies on his chest like a lover.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: But hey, man. Every day’s a brand new
deal, right? Just keep on workin’ and sump’n’s bound ta turn up.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What happened to the new American
Splendor?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: We sold ’em, babe.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: All of them?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Damn it! I put one aside for myself, next to
the register. I didn’t even get a chance to read it.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Whoa, sorry, Joyce. I didn’t know you were
such a Splendor fan. Next time take it home.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Maybe I’ll call the publisher. But they take
so damn long. Shit! Why does everything in my life have to be such a
complicated disaster…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Okay, I’m gonna hustle before the vibe in here
gets any worse.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Greetings from the second smallest state in
the union, an endless plastics and nylon plantation controlled by giant
chemical corporations.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: To make matters more dismal, there are no
decent comic book stores in my town, which is why my partner and I
opened one ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Despite our steadily faltering business, my
partner managed to sell the last copy of American Splendor #8 out from
under me. I’m a big fan and I hate to wait for a new order. Is there any
way I can get it from you direct? Sincerely, Joyce Brabner.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: …man, she’s got good lookin’
handwritin’…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Dear Joyce, Thanks for the letter. Whattya
do besides sellin’ comics?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’m a sometime activist and I teach writing
to prisoners. I try to help them build an interior life and make art out
of their monotonous, suffocating routine.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Sounds familiar. So you married or what?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’m divorced, thank god.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Look, I think you an’ I got a lot in common.
How am I gonna get you to come visit me in Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Cleveland? You think that’s a good idea?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: It’s a great idea. You should meet me,
’cause I’m a great guy. Despite the way my comics read, I got a lot of
redeeming characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I don’t know. Where would I stay?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: With me. Don’t worry, I’m not gonna put no
moves on you or anything.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’m not worried about that… Hold on, I just
spilled chamomile tea all over my bathrobe.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So what are ya worried about then?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Well, the way all those different artists
draw you, I don’t quite know what to expect. I mean sometimes you look
like a younger Brando, but then the way Crumb draws you – like a hairy
ape with all those stinky, wavy lines radiating off your body – it’s
kind of scary.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Those are motion lines. I’m an active guy.
Anyway, just come out here an’ I’ll try to be anyone you want me ta
be.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: That’s a dangerous offer. I’m a notorious
reformer…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey. Are you Joyce?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Hi, Harvey. We finally meet in person.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hiya. Look, before we get started with any
of this, ya might as well know right off the bat. I had a vasectomy.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Somethin’s wrong. Yer lookin’ around
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I guess I never imagined you eating in a
place like this.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Me? I never been here. I thought you’d like
it. But obviously ya don’t, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: It’s fine. What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I dunno. None, I guess. They sure got a lot
of meat on this menu.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: You’re a vegetarian?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I
couldn’t eat animals anymore.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Hmm. I support and identify with groups like
PETA, but unfortunately I’m a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I have all
these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal
distress. I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit
me politically when it comes to eating.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone in my
family’s got some kind of degenerative illness.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Good afternoon! I’m your server Cindy!
What can I bring you two today?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Look, I was gonna clean up, but why should I
give you any false notions? The truth is I got a serious problem with
cleanliness. I could wash a dish ten times and it’d still dirty. They
even kicked me outta the Army ’cause I couldn’t learn ta make a bed.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’ve seen worse.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey, go get me water and a few
aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What, ya got a headache?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: No, but I want to avoid one.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta
have company. I mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great
person. An’ hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but I’ve
just been through hell and back with women. I mean that last one turned
out to be a real nasty bitch.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I had a nice time with you, too.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah? You had a nice time?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Don’t make people repeat themselves. It’s
annoying.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Oh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: C’mere…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Which door’s the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey, Joyce! What’s wrong? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Ugh! I don’t know. I think that yuppie food
did me in.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I feel terrible. Lemme at least do something
for you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Can I make ya something? How about some
chamomile tea?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Chamomile tea? What the hell’s a guy like you
doing with that? I thought you drink soda pop for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I dunno. I noticed you drank a lot of it
when we started talkin’ on the phone. So I stocked up on herbal teas for
your visit.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: The girl at the Food Co-op picked me out all
kinds of herbal stuff. One of ’ems good for stomachaches. Grandma Bear’s
Tummy Mint, I think. Are you still there?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey, we better skip this whole courtship
thing and just get married.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Man, am I glad I talked you into comin’ up
here. Any more time alone and I mighta lost it fer good.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So you don’t have any problems with movin’
to Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Not really. I find most American cities
depressing in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: An’ yer okay with the vasectomy thing?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ay Toby.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No you can’t have any of my White Castle
hamburgers so please don’t even ask.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Can I have a fry?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I’m not going
to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Whattya got, a church function?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No, I’m driving to Toledo to see a movie.
Would you like to come?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight. I’m
gettin’ married.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Oh. Why Delaware?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: The chick I’m marryin’ is from Wilmington.
Plus, I gotta help her move her stuff here. Why you drivin’ ta Toledo to
see a movie?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s not playing at the Mapletown. I didn’t
know you had a girlfriend, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah. We met last week.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Toby, what movie could possibly be worth
drivin’ 260 miles round trip for?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: It’s a new film called “Revenge of the Nerds.”
It’s about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all
the time by the jocks, so they decide to take revenge. I already saw it
once.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Wow, ya really dig this movie.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: I like it a lot, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What are these nerds like? How would you
describe them?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hmm… Nerds are smart but they look and act
differently than other people. Like nerds might wear polyester button-
down shirts and flood pants where their ankles and their socks are
showing.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So what yer sayin’ is you identify with
those nerds?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And this movie
has uplifted me. There’s this one scene where a nerd grabs the
microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that
he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds. Then, he
asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward…
So nearly everyone in the place does. That’s the way the movie ends.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So the nerds won, huh?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Wow. You got this movie an’ I’m gettin’
hitched. We both had a good month, huh?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Right. Harvey, how long are you going to be in
Delaware because I’d really like to see this movie with you?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m only goin’ for a week but then I’ll have
a wife, so I’ll have to take her along. Is it a girl flick?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Depends on the girl. What kind of girl is your
new bride? Is she a nerd?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I don’t know, man. Maybe. She’s into herbal
teas.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I agree with Toby. I think it’s a story of
hope and tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Yes. It’s about time that the people who get
picked on get to be the heroes.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: It’s an entertaining flick an’ I can see why
you like it Toby, but those people on the screen ain’t even supposed to
be you! They’re college students whose parents live in big houses in the
suburbs. They’re gonna get degrees, get good jobs and stop being
nerds.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey, what did I say about loud talking?
Use your inside voice.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Look Toby, the guys in that movie are not
28-year-old file clerks who live with their grandmothers in an ethnic
ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: That’s enough, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: They didn’t get their computers like you did
– by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49.50 at the supermarket.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You’re funny Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Sure, Toby. Go to the movies and daydream,
but “Revenge of the Nerds” ain’t reality. It’s just Hollywood
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Okay, maybe I was bein’ so harsh on
Toby onna count a’ my own problems.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Y’see, I wasn’t even married a month
and my old lady was already showin’ signs a’ trouble. Granted, I tend ta
get married fast ’cause I’ll take any woman that’ll have me, but this
time I really met my match…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Okay, I think the thing with Joyce is that
as manic as Harvey can be, she matches him with depression. In that way
they complete each other. I mean, she’s obviously a very smart woman,
but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she can’t control.
And she’s totally obsessed with all things negative; y’know, diseases,
dysfuctions, etc.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What about these 78’s, Harvey? Can’t you sell
them to one of those collectors?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Are ya kidding? No way, man. I ain’t getting
rid of my 78’s.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Forget it then. I give up! How can I make
more storage space, if you won’t get rid of anything?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’ll get rid of stuff. Just not my good
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Everything’s your good stuff. How am I
supposed to live here, if there’s no room for me?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Aw come on, baby. I’ll make room for ya. You
just have to give me time. I’m not so good at these kind of things.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: That’s because you’re obsessive compulsive
Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: C’mon. I don’t wanna hear that psychobabble
crap!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I don’t care if you wanna hear it or not.
You’re the poster child for the DSM III. I’ll have you know that I come
from a very dysfunctional family. I can spot personality disorders a
mile away…</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hello Joyce. Is Harvey home?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Borderline autistic!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Polymorphously Perverse.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Paranoid Personality Disorder.</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Please leave a message.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey Joyce, it’s me. You’re not gonna believe
this but some LA producer called an’ he wants to do a play about my
life. Call me!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Delusions of grandeur.</p>
<p><strong>stage actor harvey</strong>: See, I think comics can be an
art form. With pictures an’ words, a guy can do pretty much
anything!</p>
<p><strong>stage actor joyce</strong>: That’s true, Harvey. But I didn’t
come all the way from Delaware to talk about comics …</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: If ya think readin’ comics about yer
life seems strange, try watchin’ a play about it. God only knows how
I’ll feel when I see this movie. But truth be told, the play wasn’t half
bad, and we got a free trip outta it. Things were goin’ pretty good for
a change. Variety called me “The Blue Collar Mark Twain,” and Doubleday
was interested in publishing an anthology of “American Splendor.”</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I hate checkin’ bags, man. It always takes
forever.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Jesus, look at the time. The bus is gonna
leave soon and there won’t be another one for an hour. That means I
gotta shell out an extra thirty bucks for a cab.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey wait, there’s our – Figures. That lucky
Yuppie’s gonna get on the bus in time.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Y’know Harvey, vasectomies are
reversible.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Damn Yuppies get everything.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Are you listening to me? I said vasectomies
are reversible.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What? Whattya talkin’ about? I don’t want
kids. An’ I came clean about my vasectomy the first time I set eyes on
ya’, right here in this airport.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I know but things have changed. I think we
can be a family.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Family?! What kinda family could we possibly
be? I ain’t no good with kids. I can barely take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’ll take care of the kid and you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: No way Joyce. Forget it. I can’t do it; I
can’t have no kids.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Where the hell is that Ornette Coleman
album, Joyce? I got a review due tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I didn’t touch it, Harvey. Would you let me
sleep?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: But it’s one o’clock! How late can a person
sleep?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: It happens to be Saturday you selfish
sonofabitch! And don’t you go telling me what to do. I’m the one who
moved into your city, into your home, into your vasectomy and into your
screwed- up life. The least you could do is allow me to live here my
way.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: I tried everything but nothin’ could
get this woman outta bed.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: I mean she wouldn’t get a job, wouldn’t
go out, wouldn’t make friends, nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Joyce diagnosed herself as “clinically
depressed.” I don’t know what the hell she was goin’ through but it was
sure takin’ it’s toll on me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: We can go out for dinner tonight. How ’bout
catching a bite at Tommy’s?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I give up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey Joyce, we got a message here. Why didn’t
you pick up.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Useless.</p>
<p><strong>angle on answering machine</strong>: A loud “beep,” then
…</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Hi, this is a message for Harvey Pekar.
My name is Jonathan Greene and I’m a producer for LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID
LETTERMAN. We’d like to talk to you about coming on the show to plug
your comics. Please give me a call at 212-555-3333.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Hi, this is a message for Harvey –</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Joyce finally got off the futon…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Aw, c’mon. Who the hell cares?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey, whattya doin?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Merchandising.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: People like this show?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m gettin’ hungry back here. They oughtta
leave ya donuts or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Dave’s ready for you now,
Mr. Pekar.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey, you got anything ta eat? My stomach’s
growling.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: There’s no time to eat now.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Okay. Our next guest works as a file
clerk in a Cleveland hospital.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Wait a minute. Where’s the doll?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: He’s got it at the desk. Will you relax
about that already?</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Guys, guys, we’re in a hurry
here.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: …He also writes comic books which detail
his day-to-day pains and pleasures, and this is an anthology of nine of
those comics. It’s entitled AMERICAN SPLENDOR… From off the streets of
Cleveland, please say hello to Harvey Pekar.</p>
<p><strong>the harvey pekar who walks onto the set is not the
actor</strong>: PORTRAYING HIM BUT RATHER THE REAL HARVEY PEKAR . THIS
IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE FROM HARVEY’S</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m ready for those Cleveland jokes. Go
ahead…</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Alright settle down Harvey. Settle down.
Now let’s explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work what
it is you do here, exactly. You have comic books about you in your daily
life in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: And are they embellished at all or is it
pretty much factual?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: No. It’s all true, David. All true.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: And you also have a regular job in
Cleveland working at a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: That’s right. Aiding the sick, yes.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Aiding the sick. Well that’s certainly
noble work.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Such brilliant repartee…</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Now it seems to me Harvey that you have a
very successful career here. This is being published by a major
publishing company, Doubleday. Why do you maintain the day job?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: To make a living! I don’t make a living as a
writer. I’ve been writing for many years, David. Maybe more years than
you’ve been alive.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah, I know that my youthful appearance
belies, you know, my actual age. But, I’ve been around for a long time
–</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: You know this guy?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’m beginning to wonder.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: But I have a feeling though, if you
wanted to, you could probably get by on what you make selling your work.
Because I know people are after you to write other things. You’re
publishing this anthology…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Who? What people? What people? What are you
talking about? Where the hell do you get that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m no show biz phoney. I’m telling the
truth. Come on, man.</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: At least he’s keeping up with
Letterman.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Pandering is more like it.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Damnit.</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: Excuse me, but what are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I’m trying to get some news. You know there’s
a big story about to break about the US selling arms to Iran and the
Contras.</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: That’s a monitor.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Ugh. Just forget it.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Harvey, I know you’ve got a job. I’ve got
a job. We’re both very lucky. We both have jobs.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Then what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: We’ve gotta go. Harvey I like you. I’m on
your side. I enjoy the comic books. And here, quickly tell us about the
little doll here.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: My wife made it.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Finally something good. Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: They’re made out of your old
clothing.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: And what do these go for?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Thirty-four bucks.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Thirty-four dollars? Thirty-four dollars
for this?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What are ya cheap. You cheaper than me?</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Would you pay thirty-four dollars for
that?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: No but I’m not asking it. My wife is.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: He’s a natural.</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: He is. Good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: C’mon. Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Whad’ya think?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Megalomaniac.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: It became clear pretty fast that I was
invited on the show just for laughs. But what the hell did I care?
Letterman was an okay guy. Let him take pot shots at me, s’long as I got
paid an’ got to plug my comics.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: A series of actual HARVEY appearances on
LATE NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Harvey, you are the embodiment of the
American dream…</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Funny thing is, somethin’ about me and
Letterman clicked for the viewers. He kept wantin’ me back.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: It is my pleasure to welcome back our
next guest, the lovable Harvey Pekar!</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Here was this slick, ambitious guy with
millions, winnin’ over the country by makin’ light of everything. And
then there was me… A messy loser with no dough who takes everything too
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Tell me Harvey, what do you do to get
away from the pressure of being – well, a file clerk?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Go ahead and laugh, folks. But he has more
contempt for you than I do!</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: An it wasn’t just me gettin’ all the
attention. As a result of my appearances on Letterman, my buddy Toby
Radloff landed a gig on MTV extolling the virtues of White Castle
burgers…</p>
<p><strong>mtv director</strong>: Christ! Watch where you’re going!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Fuckin’ yuppie or whatever kinda freak you
are.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: That day on the set with those MTV
jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed that real, salt of the earth people
like Toby an’ me were bein’ coopted by these huge corporations. We were
gettin’ held up and ridiculed as losers in the system. What can I say,
it was the 80’s man.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Hamburgers are a safer addiction than drugs.
Say no to drugs. Say yes to White Castle!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey, I’ve been reading about these kids
who grew up in war zones… Palestinians, Israelis, El Salvadorians,
Cambodians… These kids are amazing and they’re –</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: Hey, you’re that guy from the Letterman
show, right?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah, that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: That’s so excellent. You and Stupid Pet
Tricks are a riot.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah? Then why dontcha buy one of my comics,
man. That’s the only reason I go on that dumb show anyway.</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: Right, sure. Later, Harvey Pekar!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Anyway, I want to do a political comic book
about these kids. There’s a conference in Jerusalem in a few weeks, and
I can start by doing interviews there.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Whoa whoa, wait a second. Jerusalem? I can
barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Y’know why? ’Cause I don’t give a damn about
the Letterman show. I want to work on something important to me.
Something that matters.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey! You know I only go on the show for the
extra bread!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey… you’re yelling…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a
job, I could work on something that matters, too, huh?!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I’m sorry, baby. I – I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: I guess it was good ta finally see
Joyce excited about somethin’ of her own. Sure I was happy for her. But
I was still upset for me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: This is crazy. Can’t ya just do somethin’
here in Cleveland?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey, you’ll survive a few weeks alone.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Alright… Be careful. I love you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: It was later that night when I first
found the lump.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: I was determined to put it outta my
mind until Joyce got back. Easier said than done.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What do I care! Just gimme the chart
already!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: What is your problem today?!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Look, Miguel! I just don’t wanna keep comin’
back here for it, okay?!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Harvey, that patient’s due t’be admitted a
week from now! Why do you always have to be picking fights with
everybody?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: How many times do we gotta go through the
same bullshit. Just gimme the fuckin’ chart!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: We’ll see what the doctor says about
this.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Whadya mean? Another two weeks? Ya gotta
come home some time! Hello?</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: And there you have it, folks!
Another enlightening episode of Stupid Pet Tricks!</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: I was startin’ ta lose it. Between the
lump, the loneliness – I felt like everything wuz closin’ in on me. And
with Joyce over there savin’ the world, I never felt more like a
sell-out hack in my life.</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: Y’know ladies and gentlemen, when
Thoreau wrote that most men lead lives of quiet depression, he obviously
had not met our first guest, who happens to lead a life of whining
desperation…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Okay, asshole. You’ll pay for that one…</p>
<p><strong>letterman regular</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome back, Harvey Pekar.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey, Dave! You wanna know what my politics
are? I’m a strident leftist, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: I could have guessed half of that.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: You coulda guessed all of it, man! So why
don’t we talk about your parent company, G.E., huh? Let’s talk about
anti-trust violations and nuclear reactors!</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: Joe, put more sodas in the fridge,
there. And let’s clean up the counters. That Pekar guy’s a pig.</p>
<p><strong>production assistant #2</strong>: Whoa… you guys. Check this
out.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: You’re a cop-out, Letterman. You’re nothin’
but a shill for G.E.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: First of all, Harvey, what you are saying
is not true. Second of all, this is not the place to say it. If you want
to talk about this, go somewhere else, because you’re not talking about
it here!!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Don’t worry, Dave. I won’t come back unless
you beg me.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: You’re not coming back at all.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What do I care –</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: Because we’ve given you many, many
chances to talk about things that would be of general interest to people
–</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So what?!</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: – And also to promote your little Mickey
Mouse magazine. Your little weekly reader! But you’ve blown every chance
you’ve got. You’re a dork, Harvey!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Dave, you’re fulla shit! You’re fulla
shit!!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I guess you did it this time.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Who cares. He wasn’t helpin’ my sales
anyway. Baby, don’t go away anymore. I just can’t take bein’ alone.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: If you met those kids over there and saw what
they go through, you wouldn’t ask that of me.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: But if you go again I’m really gonna lose
it.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: It’s not open for discussion, Harvey. I need
this in my life right now.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: But I do appreciate the fact that you missed
me so much. C’mere…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey, what is that?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I don’t understand, does “tumor” mean the
same thing as “cancer”?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #2</strong>: …cat scan… diagnosis… MRI… cancer…
cancer… cancer…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: How can I have cancer? I don’t feel sick at
all.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: That’s a positive thing.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: My cousin Norman died of lymphoma. He was
twenty-nine. He was a brilliant oncologist.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Stop it! You’re not going to die, Harvey.
You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What’s going to happen to you, baby? Who’s
gonna take care of you if I’m not around?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey, look at me and focus. We are going to
get through this. I understand illness. I know how to handle these
things.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: But that’s you. I’m not strong enough. I
don’t know how ta be positive. I can’t do it. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Yes, you can. And I’ll tell you how. You’ll
make a comic book out of the whole thing. You’ll document every little
detail. And that way you’ll remove yourself from the experience until
it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I can’t do that. I’m just not strong enough…
I just wanna die.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Fine. I’ll do it without you.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, I’m Fred. You called me about the comic
book?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Right – the artist. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: This is my daughter, Danielle. I had to bring
her along. I hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Hi, Danielle. What’s that you’re holding?</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: A pony.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: A pony? What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: She’s a girl. Clarissa.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Oh, I see. Well, I’m Joyce. Nice to meet both
you and Clarissa.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’m really sorry to hear about Harvey. Is he
here?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: He’s going to work until next week, when he
starts the chemo. That’s why I wanna get this project started now. Once
he’s stuck here, I know he’ll take over.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Damnit!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Joyce, open the door! I lost my keys again!
Joyce!!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Joyce!! Open the fucking door!!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Fred?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Here are some ideas we batted around.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Sheesh. Joyce doesn’t know what she’s doing.
There’s too many words in these frames. When are ya comin’ back?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Uh, she said something about next Tuesday,
which is fine with me. Only thing is, I might have the kid again. My
ex-wife’s supposed to take her, but I don’t have much faith in her
showing up. She is in worse shape than me these days.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Next week my treatment begins. Do me a
favor. Bring the kid with you.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I wanna die… just let me die…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Joyce… Joyce?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What’s wrong, Harvey? What are you doing
up?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes
about himself in a comic book? Or am I just – just a character in that
book?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Harvey…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: When I die, will ‘dat character keep goin’?
Or will he just fade away.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: My name is Harvey Pekar. It’s an unusual
name – Harvey Pekar…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: 1960 was the year I got my first apartment
and my first telephone book. Imagine my surprise when I looked up my
name and saw that, in addition to me, another Harvey Pekar was
listed!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar… My middle
name is Lawrence… He was listed as Harvey Pekar – no middle initial…
Therefore, his was a purer listing.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Then, in the seventies, I noticed that a
third Harvey Pekar was listed in the phone book! This filled me with
curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: How could there be three people with such an
unusual name in the world, let alone in one city?!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Then one day, a person I worked with
expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death
of my father. She pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a
man named Harvey Pekar. One of his sons was named Harvey. These were the
other Harvey Pekars.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr. died.
Although I’d met neither man, I was filled with sadness. “What were they
like,” I thought. It seemed that our lives had been linked in some
indefinable way.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: But the story does not end there. For two
years later another Harvey Pekar appeared in the directory. What kind of
people are these? Where do they come from, what do they do? What’s in a
name?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Who is Harvey Pekar?</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Here’s our man a year later. Somehow I
made it through the treatments, an’ the doctors are optimistic. I guess
Joyce was right about doin’ the big comic book. We published the thing
as a graphic novel – our first collaboration – and ended up with rave
reviews. We even won the American Book Award. Go figure…</p>
<p><strong>angle on joyce</strong>: There is an awkward expression
almost resembling a smile on her face. He interrupts them.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Hey Joyce.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What is it Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: That was the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: He said I’m all clear.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: The weirdest thing that came outta my
illness was Danielle. With her real mother runnin’ around who knows
where, an’ seein’ how well her and Joyce got on, Fred decided she’d have
a better life with us. I was scared at first but then I thought, what
the hell. She’s a good kid. So we ended up takin’ her an’ raising her as
our own.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ya keep readin’ ’em backward.</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: I like reading them backward. Is that
you?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: I keep tellin’ ya, all of ’ems me, man.</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: You look like a monster.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah, well wait’ll ya see what you’re gonna
look like.</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: Me??</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Sure. Yer part of the story too, now.</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: What story?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: The story of my life.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Yeah, I know I’m not as interesting as The
Little Mermaid and all that magical crap…</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: Maybe I want to write my own comic.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Oh yeah? What about?</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: I don’t know yet. But not about you. You
have enough already.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ya know, you should write about things in
your own life. Like school and… ponies… I don’t know, girl stuff…</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: Do you have to hold my hand?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: What, are you embarrassed a’ me? I know, I’m
embarrassing. I felt the same way about my father.</p>
<p><strong>danielle</strong>: No Harvey. You’re just squeezing it too
hard. Joyce is right. You are obsessive compulsive.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a
lot. But don’t think this is some sunny, happy ending. Every day is
still a major struggle. Joyce an’ I fight like crazy, an’ she barely
works. The kid’s got A.D.D. and is a real handful. My expenses have gone
up so much that I’m writin’ freelance ’round the clock, just to make my
bills. My life is total chaos.</p>
<p><strong>real harvey</strong>: With a little luck, I’ll get a window
of good health between retirin’ an dyin’. The golden years, right? Who
knows. Between my pension and the chunk of change I got for this movie,
I should be able to swing somethin’. Sure I’ll lose the war eventually,
but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way. Right?</p>
