<p><strong>swordfish</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You know the problem with Hollywood? They
make shit. Unbelievable, unremarkable shit. I’m not some grungy
filmmaker- wannabee searching for existentialism through a haze of
bong-smoke. It’s easy to pick apart bad acting, short-sighted directing,
or the purely moronic stringing together of words many of the studios
term as prose. No, I’m talking the lack of realism. Realism. Not a
pervasive element in the modern American cinematic vision.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Take Dog Day Afternoon for example.
Arguably Pacino’s greatest performance, excepting The Godfather, Part I,
and Scarface, of course. A masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet’s
best. The acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. But, they
didn’t push the envelope. What if in Dog Day, Sonny really wanted to get
away with it? What if, and here’s where it gets tricky. What if they’d
started killing hostages? No mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the
cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam,
splatter. What? Still no bus?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: How many innocent victims would they let
get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on
hostage situations? And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no C.N.B.C., no M.T.V.
No Internet. Fast forward to the present, same situation. Can you
imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? In hours it would be the
top story from Boston to Budapest. All caught in 150 millimeter zoom,
computer enhanced, and color corrected. You would practically taste the
brain matter. Six hostages die. Ten. Twelve. Twenty. Thirty. Relentless.
One after another. All over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million
dollars that were federally insured.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Just a thought. I mean it’s not really
within the realm of conventional cinema, but what if…?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: You know, this movie of yours, I don’t
think it would have worked.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Really? How come?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Audiences love happy endings.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Pacino escapes. With the money. Boyfriend
gets the sex change operation. They live happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Homophobia?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Bad guy can’t win. It’s a morality tale.
One way or the other, he’s gotta go down.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Oh, well. Life does tend to be stranger
than fiction. Well, guys, gotta jet. This place is kinda dead.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Thanks for the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Rene Descartes is sitting in some bar in
Paris. Bartender says, ‘Hey, you want another drink?’ Descartes says, ‘I
think not.’ And disappears.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Move.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I won’t ask again.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Stanley… you coming?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: How we doin’?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Good. Take her out.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: Is everyone in position?</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: Almost, sir.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: Get her at your first opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: High ground one and two. You have a
green light.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: I’ve seen what this man is capable of –</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: The F.B.I. does not negotiate with
terrorists. I assumed you’d be aware of that. Joy.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Don’t talk, listen… When I made my Dog Day
Afternoon analogy, I was not speaking metaphorically. We have 22
hostages. Each has been wrapped with 20 pounds of C-four explosives.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: On top of that we have taped 15 pounds of
stainless steel ball bearings –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: – making them the world’s largest walking
Claymore mines.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Around her neck is a radio- frequency
electronic dog collar –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Dog walks out of his yard, he gets the shit
shocked out of him.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Stop them –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Same thing –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: – their yard is this bank. So, don’t fuck
with me.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: Hold your –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No! Noooo!!</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: Please be careful –</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: – that equipment is quite expensive.</p>
<p><strong>another customs official</strong>: Mr. Torvalds. Could you
step over here, please.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: How long am I going to be delayed?</p>
<p><strong>another customs official</strong>: It’ll be just a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>dark suit #2</strong>: Axl Torvalds. You are under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: This better be important, you
pulled me out of session.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Senator, I wouldn’t have asked you to come
here if it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Senator, we just received a communication
that Axl Torvalds was intercepted entering the continental U.S.</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Within the last two hours. According to our
source inside the F.B.I., he was nabbed coming through customs at L.A.X.
Alone…</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: Do they know who they are dealing
with?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: It is unlikely, sir. It was a routine check
and Torvalds freaked out. They just got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: This ain’t good, boys. The Vortex
has used Torvalds before. What do the feds know?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Nothing as of yet. He’s refusing to speak
English and the Finnish consulate has already contacted the State
Department…</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: So we haven’t been compromised?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: We’re not sure. We’re working on that right
now.</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: You better get sure real quick,
son, ’cause someone’s cock’s liable to end up on the block on this one.
And I promise you it won’t be mine.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Senator, I think we’ll be okay here –</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: I don’t fucking pay you to think,
Kaplan. I pay you to keep me informed. I know the Vortex. That’s why I
voted against using him on American soil.</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: It’s like using the Ebola virus to
cure a cancer patient. Son, what do you think’s going to happen if he
starts tying up loose ends.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Yessir. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who are you supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hello, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: For someone the N.S.A. has listed as the
most dangerous hacker in America, you sure don’t look like much.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Don’t look so surprised. I know everything
there is to know about you, Stan. From your mom’s maiden name to how big
your…</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bank account is.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How’d you get past my dog?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Boys like me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Great. What are you selling again?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Did I say I was selling something? I’m here
to help you, Stan. Look at you, you’re a mess.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: My employer wants to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You’re not very good at this, are you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re fucking up my chi.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Can I see that?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You need to straighten your left arm. You’re
bending it.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This is not a nice place you have here,
Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’ve only been here a few minutes and I’m
already starting to feel sorry for myself.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re wasting your time. I even touch a
computer, I go straight to Leavenworth, do not pass go, do not collect
200 dollars. Whatever I was…</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Stanley, think about it, they still teach
your techniques at</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m not here to suck your dick, Stanley, you
can sit around doing the martyr thing as long as you like. He’ll pay you
just to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I gotta go to work.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Oh that’s right, and fine work it is, too.
Stanley… Have you spoken to Holly lately?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Melissa… Holly home?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: invade her accentless</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I want to talk with Holly.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: It’s… It’s twelve-thirty, Stanley. She’s in
school. You know it’s illegal for you to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Don’t do this, Mel. It’s not good for Holly
–</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: How the hell would you know what is or
isn’t good for my daughter? You’ve spent the last two years in
prison.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Mel –</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Stop calling me that, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I just want to see my baby.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Well, she doesn’t want to see you, Stanley,
and I swear to fucking God, if you contact her, I’ll have Larry’s
attorney throw you into a hole so deep and dark it’ll make Leavenworth
seem like two weeks in Vegas; during which I’ll personally pay two
ball-busting skin-heads to –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Wow, Mel, you can take the girl out of the
trailer park, but you can’t take the trailer park out of the girl.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: I will not let myself be manipulated by
you, Stanley. Larry’s her father now.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Larry’s the porn king –</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Larry’s a film financier, a good husband,
and an astute businessman. What films he’s involved in are a function of
profitability and none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Get help, Stanley, get into a program, get
a therapist, get a dog, but whatever you do, stay away from my
child.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Your child? She’s our child.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: She will never be your child. You’ll never
have the kind of money to match Larry’s lawyers in court. Forget
Holly.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Judas.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hello, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Look, I’m beginning to lose my sense of
humor about –</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Let’s cut through the bullshit, Stan. If you
ever want to have a chance in hell of getting your daughter back you’ll
shut up and listen. Unless of course you want to stay here in your
pathetic, loser life while she learns what it’s like to be a fluffer in
one of her new daddy’s videos.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Do me the courtesy of not confusing your
own childhood with my daughter’s.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Look at your situation, Stanley. For twenty
months you’ve been in court six times, each time your custody case has
been thrown out. Your situation doesn’t look good, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: How much would it cost to retain the best
family lawyer in the country and regain custody of your daughter?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: All the way through the jury trial?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A lot.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This should get you started.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Whattaya have to lose? Just meet him. One
time. That’s it. You don’t like the setup, walk away.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: That’s it. And you keep the money.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>agent #2</strong>: Your client is wanted on 24 counts of
electronic crimes in seven different countries –</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Finland does not recognize these allegations
as crimes. Your laws –</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Do you see a Finnish flag hanging on the
wall, Ikea boy?</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: He said Ikea is Swedish.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: He understands English?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Okay… Guys, why don’t you give me a few
minutes here?</p>
<p><strong>agent #2</strong>: Uh, sir…</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: It’s okay. Just a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>agent #2</strong>: You’ve fucked up now, Hamlet.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: And Michaels.</p>
<p><strong>agent #2</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Hamlet was a Dane.</p>
<p><strong>agent #2</strong>: Adane?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Why would the number one cracker in the
world risk life imprisonment to enter the continental U.S.?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: My client has repeatedly reserved his right
not answer any questions at this time.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: He told me to tell Mister Roberts that he is
quite fond of ‘The X-Files.’</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: You need another cup of coffee –</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Until a year ago I was head of the largest
task force on cyber- criminals in the entire world. But, I burned out.
It happens. I snapped. I shot a suspect in the fucking hand. Accident.
Do you know how hard it is to work a keyboard with one hand?</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: Whatever you can do to me, he can do
worse. I’m already dead. The only place I stand a chance is back in my
country. I have friends there.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: I tell you what, you tell me what I want to
know and I guarantee you’ll be on the next flight to Finland. First
class. Courtesy of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: I’ll tell you what I know.</p>
<p><strong>bad agent #1</strong>: Yes, this is Assistant Director Joy,
would you find Agent Roberts. It’s important that I speak with him as
soon as possible. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: He exists in a world beyond your world.
What we only fantasize, he does. He lives a life where nothing is beyond
him.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: But it is all an act.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: For all his charisma and charm. For all
his wealth and expensive toys.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: Beneath it all he is a driven,
unflinching, calculating machine, who takes what he wants, when he
wants, then disappears –</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: – It works like this.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: I fly to where I am to meet him. He sends
one of his people to meet me.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: He tells me what he needs. I do my job,
I’m paid.</p>
<p><strong>torvalds</strong>: And I leave.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: That’s a real nice story. But you haven’t
given me shit.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Excuse me, sir… you have a call.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: So, take a message.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: It’s Assistant Director Joy, he said it’s
important.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: At least it’s not my wife. You need to
think about what else you know. Watch him.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: You will be hearing from my gover –</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: This is Roberts, I have a call from A.D.
Joy.</p>
<p><strong>fbi operator</strong>: Hold, sir.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: Joy.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Roberts. You needed me.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: You didn’t call me?</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: You just called me…</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I wish you’d let me buy you a suit.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m happy with what I’m wearing.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You have no self-esteem, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Miss me?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Gabriel, Stanley. Stanley, Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Big Stan. Nice suit.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You know, they say it’s the clothes that
make the man…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You buy it?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Hope not. Buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I flew fifteen hundred miles for this
meeting, how ’bout we get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Actually you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand.
But that’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I heard this story about this young hacker
who made a virus that broke the F.B.I.’s Carnivore program that was
actively reading every subscriber’s E-mail and scrambled the systems. He
did what the federal judges wouldn’t do and kept the government out of
our Privacy.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I think I heard that. Story is he went to
jail and the federal Carnivore program is back in full swing. It was a
real tragedy. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Stanley, meet Helga.</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: Hi, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Look, I don’t have a lot of patience for
this –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Stanley, we have a problem, maybe you can
help us out.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: faced with a fifth</p>
<p><strong>helga</strong>: You like tequila, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No need for modesty, we’re all friends
here, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: This is bullshit. I came –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You want something from me, amigo, I want
something from you. D.O.D. dBase, 128 bit R.S.A. encryption. Whattaya
think? Impossible?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Nothing’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: So it can be done? Maybe slide in a Trojan
horse hiding a worm?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Something like that. Is this an
interview?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Sort of. Marco, let’s give him some
incentive.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Relax, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’ve been told the best crackers in the
world could do this in sixty minutes. Unfortunately, I need someone who
can do it in sixty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re kidding…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: ’Fraid not.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Forty-five seconds. Time is a wasting, big
guy.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You have thirty seconds, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: She’s very good, isn’t she, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: C’mon, Stanley. 20 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Ten… Nine…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Three… Two…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Too bad, Stanley. Ya gotta die.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Wait… !</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I was just fucking with you, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So was I.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Relax, Stanley. You can do this.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Help? Help what, squeegee my brain off the
ceiling?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It was just a test, Stan, you passed.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A test… I don’t know why I let you talk me
into this. I can’t believe how desperate I am.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I thought you were here saving your
daughter, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Look… I’d do anything to get Holly back.
But, if I end up in a box or back in jail, then I really can’t help her,
can I? What I should do, is take my money and go back to court.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Back to court? Back to Melissa’s gladiators?
You throw a hundred grand at her, she’ll throw five back at you. It’s
not about Holly, it’s about beating you. You know that. Think,
Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What I’m thinking about is that you’re
willing to put a gun to my head to see if I can hack –</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: So, let me sum it up for you, Stanley. You
live in a trailer. You’re a felon, working a dead- end job. You want to
get Holly back, Gabriel’s your only shot.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Big Stan. I was afraid we lost you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Tell me what the deal is.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Let’s go up to the house. I’m having a
little get-together. I’ll explain it to you there.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Tell me you have some good news for me.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: Actually we have a small ray
of hope in the vast darkness that is your life, sir. Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: See these two guys?</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: Now watch this…</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: Recognize those two, same
guys, next day. Question is –</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: – who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Stanley Jobson…</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: Wired’s man of the year, 1996.
Pretty much a burnout but he was the hacker zeitgeist of his day –</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: I know who Jobson is. I busted him. Why are
you in L.A.?</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: His ex-wife lives in
Malibu.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #2</strong>: The new husband owns Backdoor
Films, a shady porn production house in Chatsworth. Decent production
value but they only shoot on video. His wife actually starred in a
couple of his videos. Apparently she’s an ‘actress.’</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Who’s the chick?</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: We don’t know yet, sir.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #2</strong>: Serious piece of talent.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #3</strong>: Way outta his league.
Something’s up.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #2</strong>: You know he also has a
ten-year- old daughter, who he’s not supposed to see. Maybe that’s why
he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #2</strong>: Or maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: I want to know who that girl is.
Pronto.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: And stake out his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: So Stan, tell me. How’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Break the code. At the club. You broke the
entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in
someone’s mouth, all in less than sixty seconds. How?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I used a logic bomb, dropped it through the
trap door –</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No, you didn’t. You didn’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: C’mon, you can do better than that. How’d
you do it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I used a password sniffer.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yes, I did –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: C’mon, Stanley. How’d-you-do-it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t know exactly. I see the numbers. In
my head. All my life. I don’t answer equations, I just see the answers.
Same with code. I can’t explain —</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Mozart always said he didn’t write music; he
just wrote down what he heard in his head. So did Faulkner, just with
words.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You definitely have a gift, Stan. The most
powerful people on the planet are like you. With a laptop and a phone
line you can make God look like a thirteen-year-old with a stack of
Playboys and a lack of imagination. C’mere, Stan, let me show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Pretty impressive, huh. So…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Here’s the deal. I need a worm, Stanley. A
hydra, actually. A multi-headed worm to break an encryption and then
sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What kind of cypher?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Vernam encryption.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: A Vernam’s impossible. Its key code is
destroyed upon implementation. Not to mention being a true 128 bit
encryption.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Actually, we’re talking 512 bit.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Tell ya what, I’ll pay you ten million
dollars. That should be enough to get your daughter back… … unless of
course it’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Nothing’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: C’mon, Stan. Let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It won’t bite you, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t know. It’s gonna be pretty hard
without a gun to my head.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Well, let’s put a gun to your head.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Tell me about your worm, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You surprised that a girl with real breasts
and an I.Q. over 70 can give you a hard-on?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I thought you were Gabriel’s.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I am not what you think I am.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You’re a smart guy, Stanley. You figure me
out.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Don’t you have that just-fucked-
the-neighbor’s-cat look this morning.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Problem?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Pretty impressive.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I thought we went over all that last
night.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The book, Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Ohhh. Look, no pictures. Get out of my
light.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Can I borrow your car? There’s something I
need to do.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: If you’re going to see your daughter, you
might want to reevaluate the way you look. Just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can I give you a lift?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Look, creep, I don’t think so –</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Daddy? Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Hey, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Daddy… What are you doing here? I missed you
so much.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Me too, baby. I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, Daddy. If Mom finds out you’re here she’s
gonna have you thrown back in jail.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s okay, baby. Let me give you a ride
home.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You believe in me, right?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Of course, but –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’ve found a way to get you back,
sweetheart. It’s my one shot and I’m taking it. Just give me a couple of
days.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I don’t want anything else to happen to you,
Dad.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Holly, everything’s going to be okay. You
just have to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I love you, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>dark suit #1</strong>: Friend of a friend. Let’s take a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>dark suit #1</strong>: Gotta suck to be you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Cut him off at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Fuck this.</p>
<p><strong>dark suit #2</strong>: Why didn’t you do that earlier,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>dark suit #2</strong>: Sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Go get him.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: What are you doing in L.A., Stan?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Vacationing…</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Why were you running? We just wanted to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Are you arresting me?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: For violating your parole by leaving Texas
without permission or for evading a federal agent and almost getting me
killed in the process?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Then why are we talking?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Didn’t know the court lifted the sanction
preventing you from seeing your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: You just want to cut through the
pleasantries and get down to business? Fine. I can help you with your
daughter, Stan. Help me, I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’ll have to forgive me, the fact that
you put me in jail for 18 months doesn’t inspire a lot of trust.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Whether I agreed with what you did or not,
you broke the law, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I guess we were both doing what we had to.
This was a nice trip down memory lane, but if you’re not arresting
me…</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: So, why was it you are in L.A. again?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I told you –</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: – vacationing. That’s right. Ya know it’s
funny. Axl Torvalds was just here for a vacation, too. Isn’t it odd that
the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m a sucker for Disneyland. Tell Torvalds
I said hello.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: If you’re not careful you can tell him
yourself. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Give him a card.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: In case you think of anything else you want
to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sorry about your nose.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Hey, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: You know, you’re in way over your head
here.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: It’s a long walk back up the hill, Stanley.
You want us to give you a lift?</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Follow him.</p>
<p><strong>random agent</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I have to hand it to you, Ginger. You look
good wearing anything. Even a wire.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You gonna kill me?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m thinking. What are you doing here,
Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I should probably ask you the same
question.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Little accident. Sorry about your car. I’ve
had a pretty shitty day so far. Looks like it just got worse. Who are
you, Ginger?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You can’t tell me? Well, that’s just
fuckin’ peachy.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Think, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: He’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s not my problem, is it? You’re asking
for a lot of faith here, Ging, without givin’ me any. You –</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: – Stanley –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: – brought me into this mess –</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: – Stanley –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: – I deserve to know who’s playing me,
Ginger. Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m D.E.A., Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Ginger…?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Well, Ging, doesn’t this look friendly.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m a friendly girl.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Actually…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Thought maybe you’d like to see me get you
your hydra.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Get?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You look like shit. Ginger kick your
ass?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Funny.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Miss me?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Terribly.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: My senior year at M.I.T., I created the
source code for the worm that I’ve been using for years.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: In the basement and through a file room is
the only P.D.P.-10 still active and on the internet, although only a few
people know this. It’s an I.T.S. machine and kept online just for
historical sake. I hid my worm inside it where no one would ever think
to look.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Now I just have to modify the code.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: He’s fucking amazing.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I see you have a groupie.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know, it’d be a lot simpler if you
would tell me exactly what the hydra is going to be used for?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Have you heard of Operation Swordfish?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You’ll appreciate the irony here –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: – In the early Eighties the D.E.A. set up a
network of dummy corporations as a government front to launder drug
money and gather evidence. Problem is, the front companies started
making money. Lots of money. By 1986, when Operation Swordfish was
terminated, there was close to 400 million dollars in the D.E.A.’s
accounts.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Money that just sorta disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It didn’t disappear. It just sat in those
accounts earning interest, it’s been 15 years. You have any concept how
much money we’d be actually talking about today? Billions, brother.
That’s nine zeros. Look, this is a sweet deal. We go in over phone
lines. Pop the firewall, drop in the hydra, and just sit back and wait
for the money.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Before we can tap into the secure cluster,
you have to find one of the banks on the backbone of this network. Do
you know how many banks there are in the U.S.? It could take years.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No problem. Look behind you, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: We don’t know that yet,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #2</strong>: There’s definitely something
going on. There are two T-5 trunks going into the house. That’s serious
bandwidth. Thermal scopes indicate a huge heat-load in the main living
area. Could be from mainframes, although they must have a genny ’cause
power consumption is right on par.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #1</strong>: Some of these fellows might be dressed
in Armani, but they definitely have the swagger of ex- military. Maybe
bodyguards but they seem more like mercs to me.</p>
<p><strong>fbi computer geek #1</strong>: From here we’re having trouble
pinning any of them down. Sure would be nice to task a satellite,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: I’m working on it. Send what you have
up-lines, maybe we’ll have one by the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Who the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Senator.</p>
<p><strong>senator reisman</strong>: Close the door.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: We have a problem. Look at these.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: We have him yet?</p>
<p><strong>communication</strong>: He’s coming online now, sir.
Ready.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: We have a problem –</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: – Seems you have gotten yourself in a
predicament.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’m not exactly following you.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: Transfer the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Senator, I sincerely hope you did not
contact me and jeopardize the safety of me and my men for this.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: Goddamn right I did. You know where I got
that? From the deputy director of the F.B.I. He thought I might be
interested.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Sir, with all due respect. Do you think
there is any aspect of this operation I am not fully aware of?</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: We are aborting the operation and securing
alternative means of finance elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: We are aborting this operation. Take a
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: A vacation? Have I ever failed you,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It’s my point. Senator, this operation is
going forward.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: You understand what you are saying?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Everything is under control.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: Do it. Terminate the Vortex.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Yessir. Sir, he does work for us.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: Excuse us. Son, let’s say you have a 200-
pound Rottweiler. He loves you, and it’s his job to protect you. But if
he ever bites you, even once, you gotta put him down. You can’t have an
uncontrollable weapon running unchecked in your back yard. He becomes a
liability. You never know who he might bite next.</p>
<p><strong>kaplan</strong>: Yessir, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Fuck!!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Stan?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: What’s wrong, Stanley, you look like you’ve
seen a ghost?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: C’mon, Stanley. Let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why can’t we talk here?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: ’Cause I don’t want to talk to you in the
house, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: How you doing, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Something you need to say to me?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You know anything about Harry Houdini?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: He used to make an elephant disappear in a
theater full of people. You know how he did it?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Misdirection.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: We have a tail. Hope you had a light lunch,
Stan.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Hold the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shit, it’s blocked.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Keep it straight.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: It’s just rough when you grow up lovin’
James Bond movies. Don’t worry, Stanley, it’ll be over soon.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Drive, drive!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Go, go!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I am!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Keep your cool, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Goddamit. I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Get in the fucking car, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m not going anywhere until you tell me
what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You’re on my good side and you want to stay
there. Stanley, I like you, but don’t confuse kindness with weakness.
So, get in the fuckin’ car. I need my hydra.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Stanley? You alright?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What do you think? I just watched that
maniac murder ten men in the street. I’m just fucking great. It doesn’t
matter if I get my daughter back if I’m dead. Even if I do survive this,
who’s gonna keep me out of jail? You?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I won’t let anything happen to you, Stanley.
You have to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Trust you? Two hours ago I found out you’re
D.E.A. The feds are crawling up my ass and there’s a dead body in the
basement that looks just like Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Stanley, if we don’t find out who he’s
working for then we’re just going to have to do this all over again.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Your little slush fund is not my problem.
I’m pulling the plug on this rodeo. Roberts may be an asshole, but he is
definitely the lesser of the two evils.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’ve been working on this thing for eight
months, and I will not let some jarhead fed fuck up my operation.
Please, I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: C’mon, Stanley. You have twelve hours. Do
what he wants. Finish the worm.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re starting to sound just like him.</p>
<p><strong>95 omitted 95</strong>: &amp; &amp; 96 96</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Ahh, the great American outdoors. I’ll
never understand the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too much like
masturbation for me, without the payoff.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: This’s a catch-and-release stream, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Oh c’mon, Jim. You gotta see the irony in
the chairman of the Joint Sub-Committee on Crime, fishing in a
catch-and-release stream.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: How could you do it, Jim? After all we have
sacrificed. All the blood, all the death… I’ve changed my identity so
many times, I don’t even know what I look like anymore. How could you
turn on me when we are so close?</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: You did this to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You brought me in to get the job done and
you didn’t want to know about the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: The F.B.I. was watching you –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I told you there was nothing that I was
unaware of –</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: That’s why we’re here. You are too
arrogant, too aggressive –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You have misplaced your loyalties, Senator.
You have sold America out. I am a patriot, and patriotism does not have
a four-year shelf life. Unfortunately, politicians do.</p>
<p><strong>reisman</strong>: And what are you going to do with that?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the
White House lawn for treason, Senator. You tried to execute me in the
name of politics, now I execute you in the name of the people.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You’re up, mate.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Get your shit, we’re headin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>100 omitted 100</strong>: thru thru</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Make sure that bus doesn’t top out over
fifteen-seven.</p>
<p><strong>merc</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Stan, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Have you finished?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What? Hello.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Hello, Mr. Jobson. This is Kristine
Jorgenson of Credit Suisse in Grand Cayman.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I need to verify your new account
information and have you choose a personal password.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Mr. Jobson, there has just been a transfer
of ten million U.S. dollars into your account.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Just like I promised, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Then let me go. I want to see my
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Soon, Stanley. Walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’m about to do something against my better
judgement. I’m going to tell you something I never tell anyone. I’m
going to tell you who I am.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Don’t bother. I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Do you? You think I’m a bank robber.
Really, I’m just like you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Like me? You’re a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: That I am. And worse. Much worse. I am
forced to operate on a different plane than you. But, I have ethics.
Rules to which I must adhere.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote a
letter to Madison because he was concerned that the freedoms of the
constitution would be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t understand why the fuck you’re
telling me this.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Listen to me and you will. In the 1950s,
armed with this letter, J. Edgar Hoover created an organization to
protect the freedoms of this country at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I don’t care about any of this. All I care
about is my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’m talking about your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: My daughter…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Yes. You, your daughter and 200 million
other Americans who take their freedoms for granted. You don’t
understand what it takes to protect those freedoms. That’s my job,
Stanley, to protect your way of life at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: So you and your band of lunatics are really
stealing all this money to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: That’s right, Stanley –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: – ’cause wars cost money.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’re going into the fucking bank.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: That’s what I’m telling you, Stanley. We
are at war.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: War? Who are we at war with?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Anyone who infringes on America’s freedom.
Terrorists’ states, Stanley. Someone must take their war to them. They
bomb a church, we bomb ten. They hijack a plane, we take out an airport.
They execute American tourists, we tactically nuke an entire city. We
must make terrorism so horrific that it becomes unthinkable to attack
Americans.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m out. I’m not doing this. You’re
insane.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Maybe. I wanted you to do this because you
wanted to, because we need men like you, but our time table’s been moved
up. Just relax and it will all be over in twenty-four hours. You’re
rich, Stanley. Pretty soon Holly and you will be basking in the sun on
the deck of some eighty-foot scarab, eating bon bons and living the good
life.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Pretty slick.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You want to send a team after him?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No. He’ll be back. We gotta move. Load
up.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Get that son-of-a-bitch on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: If you need to test my resolve then God
help you. You have 25 minutes. That plane better be on the runway.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Get my money, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Not until I see my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Do you really think I wanted it to come to
this. Do you? I am not a psychopath, Stanley, but I told you, I will
sacrifice as many lives as it takes to protect our country, including my
own. Now get me my money.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Will you let Holly go once you have the
money?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Both of you. You have my word, Stanley.
C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: We okay?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Look at the cover pattern they’ve set up. The
right hand doesn’t know what the left’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Look at this bozo. If the shit drops, he’s
gonna cap his buddy in the back of the head. Idiots.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I need the disk.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Almost done.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Whoa! What the hell just happened?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: They just cut the power. Forget it. How
long to transfer the money?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Couple of minutes. Which accounts?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: National Bank of Zurich. Spread it evenly
over these accounts. It won’t be there that long.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Good job, Stanley, I got someone who wants
to see you.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Holly!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Hold up.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Told you I was a man of my word,
Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s okay. I love you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: See ya around.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>cypher merc #3</strong>: Sir, the money just disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cypher merc #3</strong>: The money, it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: What do you mean, gone?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shit! Run, Holly!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Get her!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Won’t do you any good. The money jumps
every 60 seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the
next ten years. ’Course it wasn’t supposed to happen for another six
hours. The power surge must have scrambled the internal clock. But, you
kill me and you never get a single dollar.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You let the hostages go and then I’ll tell
you where and when you can extract the money. We all walk away, nobody
gets hurt. The accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher. Even I
can’t break through the fire wall. It’s my act of God policy. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Tell ya what. No deal.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Marco! Grab Agent Sculley!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No, don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: In all reality, Stan, she has you to thank
for this. That first night in Prague you broke the D.O.D. database that
contained her true identity. She’s D.E.A., Stan, but without you, I
never would have known.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What are you doing? Stop!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: String up the D.E.A. bitch.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Just let her down. I’ll do whatever you
want.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Then get me my money, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I’m not doing shit until you bring her
down. I’m serious. Let her down. Now!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Nooo…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Take a moment, big guy. Don’t make me put
you in a wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You didn’t have to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I didn’t Stan, you did. But we’re not done
yet. Marco…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: There are a lot of hostages here. I cared
about Ginger, can you imagine what I could do to someone I don’t care
about. How long before the money jumps?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sixty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: They better hope you installed a back door
or it could be a long day. Somebody get me a laptop.</p>
<p><strong>computer merc</strong>: Money just jumped.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Okay, Stan. Sixty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Forty-five seconds, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I need another laptop, logged on!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Twenty seconds, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Fifteen. She’s gonna die, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: C’mon, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Nine… Eight… Seven.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I need your account number.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Four, three, two…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Now, goddammit, it’s done. Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Well, that was fun.</p>
<p><strong>merc</strong>: Joy says the plane is ready.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Well, ’bout time for us to leave.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They’ll never let you escape. You’ve gone
too far.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Au contraire. Do you hear that? That’s the
sound of America watching.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Let’s roll.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: You just gonna let them drive the fuck on
outta here?</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: There isn’t a free cop in a hundred miles
that isn’t on his ass. He wants a plane. He’ll get a plane.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: He won’t get away. We’ll take them at the
airport. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I don’t think any of us want a repeat of
this morning. Keep at least a hundred yards from this bus at all times
and I want the airspace for five miles clear.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: and turning to the</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Whaddaya think, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You’ll never get away. Even if they have to
kill everyone on the bus.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Really? Five hundred bucks says I do. Tell
ya what, Stanley, I’ll even spot you the five bills.</p>
<p><strong>128 omitted 128</strong>: thru thru 132 132</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Stan, c’mere.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How the fuck can you justify all this?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You’re not looking at the big picture.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Stanley, here’s a scenario. You have the
power to cure all of the world’s diseases. But the price for this is
that you must kill a single, innocent child. Could you kill that child
to save the world?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You disappoint me, Stanley. It’s the
greatest good.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How about ten innocents?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Now you’re getting it. How about a
hundred?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: How about a thousand? Not to save the
world, but just to preserve our way of life.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No man has the right to make that decision.
You’re no different than any other terrorist.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You’re wrong, Stanley. Some men are put
here to shape destiny, to protect freedom, despite the atrocities they
must commit. I am one of those men. Thousands die every day for no
reason at all, where is your bleeding heart for them? You give your
twenty dollars to Greenpeace every year and think you are changing the
world. What countries will harbor terrorists, when they realize the
consequences of what I will do? Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads
in Minsk for forty million each? I buy half a dozen, I even get a
discount.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What the fu –</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: I saw Sugarland Express, Stan. Didn’t like
the way it ended.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I thought we were going to the airport.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Misdirection, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Listen…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Well why the fuck not.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: Everything in place?</p>
<p><strong>agent torres</strong>: We’re ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: Good –</p>
<p><strong>agent thomas</strong>: – sir…</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>agent thomas</strong>: I don’t think they’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: What do you mean you don’t think they’re
coming?</p>
<p><strong>agent thomas</strong>: The bus was just lifted off the street
by a giant helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>a.d. joy</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: The only way to fly, huh, Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Bank right!</p>
<p><strong>broker</strong>: Holy sh…</p>
<p><strong>154 omitted 154</strong>: &amp; &amp; 155 155</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: We okay?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: We’ll make it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Well, Stanley, gotta fly. Take care of that
little girl. Maybe I’ll see you again one day.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It can’t end like this. You can’t get
away.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: C’mon, Stan. Everything doesn’t always end
the way you think it will. ’Sides, audiences love happy endings.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: I’m F.B.I…</p>
<p><strong>swat guy</strong>: Check the rest of the hostages, we’ll come
back for them.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Are we sure this is Gabriel?</p>
<p><strong>doctor micheals</strong>: The body’s dentals exactly match
the dentals the Israeli government sent us for an ex-Mossad agent named
Gabriel Shears.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: It sure looks like Gabriel Shear. What the
hell was he doing in that bank?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What about Ginger?</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: We searched all the hospitals and morgues
but we haven’t been able to find her body yet.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You can’t find her body?</p>
<p><strong>torres</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Keep looking. Bodies just don’t fucking
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Disappear…</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Houdini made an elephant disappear in a
room full of people.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: You know how he did it?</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Elephant suit. Filled with his
assistants.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Assistants jump out. Blend in with the
others.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Voila.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: No more elephant.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m D.E.A., Stanley.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: – so advanced nowadays you could probably
pilot it from your trailer.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: Misdirection…</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: Cheer up, Stan, we got him. You’re a
hero.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Yeah that’s me. Hero.</p>
<p><strong>roberts</strong>: I was wrong about you, Stanley. I wanted
you to know that. You know, you should take your daughter on vacation.
Relax a little, you’re lucky to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I would like to transfer money between my
employer’s accounts.</p>
<p><strong>bank executive</strong>: Certainly. May I have your
employer’s account number and password, please?</p>
<p><strong>bank executive</strong>: account number, realizing who she
is</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s why I’m here. My employer doesn’t like
drawing attention to himself. He likes to keep a low profile.</p>
<p><strong>bank executive</strong>: Of course. Would you feel more
comfortable dealing with the bank president?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Would you?</p>
<p><strong>bank executive</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Get him.</p>
<p><strong>bank executive</strong>: Right away. A glass of Cristal while
you… Wait a moment…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bank executive</strong>: There seems to have been a series of
large withdrawals out of this account.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Everything okay, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Everything’s fine. Just making the last of
some charitable donations..</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How about you, almost done?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yep. Got it all figured out.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Well, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: By the way, where exactly are we going?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: The Petrified Forest.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: The Petrified Forest.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Right. And I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Scoot over, you.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Know why they call it the Petrified
Forest?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>woman from bank</strong>: You’re not fucking gonna believe
this. Stanley –</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: – How much he leave?</p>
<p><strong>woman from bank</strong>: 500 bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You don’t seem that upset.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Did you ever see the Maltese Falcon?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: 1941. Nominated for three Academy Awards, lost,
but what the fuck does the Academy know anyway. John Houston’s first
film and probably Bogey’s best.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: At the end, when they realize the bird’s a
fake, and all they had gone through and sacrificed was for nothing,
Gutman, the bad guy in the movie, says, ‘well, sir, what do you think,
shall we stand here, shed tears, and call each other names, or shall we
go to Istanbul?’</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Istanbul? What’s in Istanbul?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The, ah, stuff dreams are made of.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Huh?</p>
