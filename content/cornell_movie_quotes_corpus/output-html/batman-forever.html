<p><strong>production draft</strong>: —————- June 24, 1994</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hell of a night, huh Doc?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Hell’s in here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. burton</strong>: Mr. Dent…</p>
<p><strong>dr. burton</strong>: Counselor…</p>
<p><strong>dr. burton</strong>: Harvey….</p>
<p><strong>dr. burton</strong>: Harvey are you alright…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …And in Gotham City, ex-District
Attorney Harvey Dent escaped from Arkham Asylum for the Criminally
Insane.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Dent, once Gotham’s leading contender
for Mayor, was horribly scarred during an indictment hearing over a year
ago.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Dent, whose left-brain was damaged
during the assault, launched a grizzly crime spree before being captured
by The Batman. He is extremely dangerous. Repeat….</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: The solar generator tests are back.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Uh… great, could you wait a second…</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: The Mayor’s office called again -</p>
<p><strong>society matron</strong>: Who are you asking to the circus
-</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Five minutes to your inspection -</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, I want you all to just stand here for
fifteen seconds, okay? Fifteen, everybody got it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good. Nobody move, now.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I gotta give myself a raise…</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: Your weekly inspections are a departmental
highlight.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Really? You all need to get out more.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: We’ll probably go to the house for dinner.
Yes. Yes. Maybe he’ll throw a little party in my honor.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Idiot! Should have rented a tuxedo. Relax.
I’m sure Wayne manor has extra. After all, we’re almost the same
size.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Oh my God. It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: Well, Mr. Wayne, on to R&amp;D?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Um…I’m pretty sure I’m Bruce Wayne. And you
are?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me.
Personally. Just like I tell everyone. Well, we’ve never actually met,
but your name was on the hire slip.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m gonna need that hand back, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: What? Ah yes. Of course. I’m sorry. It’s
just that…you’re my idol. And some people have been trying to keep us
apart.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Mr. Nygma, you’ll forgive me for being rude.
But what exactly is on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Precisely. What’s on all our minds?
Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His
project was terminated this morning…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is
man’s greatest tool?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Man’s greatest tool is…The mind.</p>
<p><strong>21 edward 21</strong>: Voila. While holographically enhancing
any TV picture, my invention connects directly to the viewer’s brain,
puts the audience inside the show. Think of the entertainment problems
we can solve.</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: I can think of a couple problems that need
solving right here.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My
RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king. Not that
someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming.
But for the lonely, the…</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: Paranoid? The psychotic?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: …The Box can change their lives. Our stock
coupons will spike.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a
few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: Fred?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wayne Enterprises will spearhead an
entertainment revolution.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I just need a bit of additional funding. For
human trials. Let me show you….</p>
<p><strong>23 bruce 23</strong>: Maybe some other time..</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I want you to know, we’ll be full partners
in this, Bruce. What talks we’ll have, late into the night. Now, I’m not
used to business travel, so go easy on me. As for recognition, I’m sure
after a time I’ll get used to it. Look at us. Two of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Bruce…?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Call my secretary, she’ll set something up.
Factory looks great, folks. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Wait. You can’t go.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We’ll talk some other -</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No. Don’t leave me! My invention! I need
you!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m sorry, Edward. Just feels a bit like mind
manipulation. It raises too many question marks.</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: Alright everyone, back to work. We’ll
discuss this later.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You were supposed to understand.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll make you understand.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Lock.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Capsule.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred…</p>
<p><strong>29 alfred 29</strong>: I saw the signal, is. All is
ready.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I suppose I couldn’t convince you to take
along a sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’ll get drive-thru. Go…</p>
<p><strong>thug 1</strong>: Bat should show any minute, Face.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: You. Sport. Any thoughts? Counting on
Batass to rescue you?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: <em>We</em> sure are.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: …You gonna kill me?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Might. Might not. Could say we’re of two
minds on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I got family. …Please.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: What say we flip for it?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: What could be fairer than the random toss
of an honest coin? Life…</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: …or death.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Please. I swear I won’t say noth-</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: The coin <em>wants</em> to decide.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Exhilarating, isn’t it? The suspense?
Sudden death or a new lease on life? Really makes a man live in the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: You’re in luck. You get to live to whimper
another day.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: That floor has got to be very hard. Is
that better?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh…Face.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a
sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about
we cut you in for a share of tonight’s haul?</p>
<p><strong>thug 2</strong>: Face! For cryin’ out loud! You’re not gonna
pay him–</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Did we ask your opinion? The coin has
rendered its verdict. This man has a family to take care of. You have a
problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>thug 2</strong>: Oh no, Face. Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Hot entrance.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Two-Face?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Two guards dead. He’s holding the third
hostage. Didn’t see this one coming.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: We should have, though.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: <em>Two</em> million dollars waiting to be
transferred from the <em>Second</em> Bank of Gotham on the <em>22nd</em>
How could Harvey? <em>Two</em>-Face resist?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Batman, I’d like you to meet–</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Chase Meridian</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I asked Dr. Meridian to come to Gotham to
consult on this case. She specializes…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: …dual personalities. Abnormal psychology.
Washington’s poster child for the criminally insane. I read your
work.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I’m flattered. Not every girl makes a
super-hero’s night table. You might have some interesting insights into
Two-Face.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Let’s just say I could write a hell of a
paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Bats aren’t rodents, Dr. Meridian.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I didn’t know that. See? You <em>are</em>
interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or
do I just call you bats?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: May I remind you two we have a psychopathic
murderer on the loose here?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Right on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>thug 1</strong>: The Bat’s taking the bait! What now?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: At last, The Bat dies!</p>
<p><strong>thug 2</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Kill him too.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Wait! You said you’d let me go!</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Never heard of a double-cross?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Come on in, the water’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>swat leader</strong>: Police! Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Not the guest list we had in mind. Boys,
the party’s over.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Let’s fly.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: The man is taking his job <em>much too
seriously</em>.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: That was our money.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: He wants to play. Fine, let’s play.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Face!!!</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Ah, to finally be rid of that pointy
eared, steroid eating, rubber suited, cross dressing, night rat…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Uh…boss….</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Harvey, you need help. Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Words of wisdom from our ex-friend?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Mano a Mano a Bato.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Surrender.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Ever been to Arkham, Batman? You’d feel
right at home. You took a year of my life. So I’m here to pay you back.
There’s only one way out of this waltz. One of us dies.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I won’t kill you, Harvey.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Batman doesn’t kill? Bullshit. You’re a
killer too.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Goodbye old pal.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Too many questions. Too many questions.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I’ll show you it works.</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: Your project is terminated. I’m calling
security.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Caffine’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: This won’t hurt a bit. At least I don’t
think it will.</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: Goddamnit, you press that button and-</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Loosing resolution. More power.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Fred Stickley. Come on down. You’re the next
contestant on I Want Your Brain. Nygma your machine has unexpected side
effects. A feed back loop has caused your brain to absorb Stickley’s
neural energy. Stickley, I’ve had a break- through! And a breakdown?
Maybe. Nevertheless. I’m smarter. Hell, I’m a genius. More than a
genius. Several geniuses. Genae. Genie.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain
deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons. Patient exhibits symptoms
of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be
dangerous to the subject. Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to
someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine
pumps with the power of yours. New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think
faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da
pump. Yeah. Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The
acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio,
you little runt. Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer.
Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course.
A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman.
A poet. A chick in a short skirt wouldn’t be so bad either.</p>
<p><strong>stickley</strong>: …Fired…your fired…your fired. You
understand?! Fired!!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>130 edward 130</strong>: Fred. Babe. <em>You</em> are fired.
Or should I say Terminated!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Question marks, Mr. Wayne?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My work raises too many question marks?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Two years. 3.5762 percent of my estimated
lifespan toiling for your greater glory and profit.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Well, let me ask you some questions,
Mr. Smarter Than Thou. Why are you so debonair? Successful? Richer than
God? Why should you have it all and not me? Yes, you’re right, there are
too many questions, Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Like why hasn’t anybody put you in your
place? And it’s time you came up with some answers. Starting right
now!</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: You’re a killer too.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: The dreams again, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I think they’re getting worse.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: It’s a wonder you sleep at all.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What a marvelous shade of purple.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Really, sir, if you insist on trying to get
yourself killed each night.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: …Would it be a terrible imposition to ask
you to take better care of your equipment?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Then you’d have nothing to complain
about.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Hardly a worry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Commissioner Gordon phoned. There’s been an
accident at Wayne Enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why? Oh, why? I can’t believe it. Two years.
Working in the same office. Shoulder to shoulder, cheek to cheek, —we’re
talking face, by the way—and then this. I found this in my cubicle.
You’ll find the handwriting matches his exactly as does sentence
structure and spelling.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: We’ve questioned everyone who worked on the
floor. Computer records show no one going in or out after Stickley.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Computer records can be forged. I’ll have my
people pull up –</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Suicide. With all due respect, leave the
police work to us. We’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: The society matrons of Gotham have called
a record thirty-two times. Not to mention the press. I think that if
they don’t know soon who you plan to take to the charity circus, the
world will most surely come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: I don’t know. I didn’t see anyone…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No postmark. No stamp.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The Riddler? Why can’t anyone in this town
have a normal name?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Channel 12, sir.</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: –joined us, we’re talking about the
mutilation of Lady Gotham, caused late last night by Batman-</p>
<p><strong>145 bruce 145</strong>: <em>Excuse</em> me?!</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: – will take up to nine months to repair.
Today’s topic: Batman-crime- fighter or criminal?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: How ’bout Two-Face? Anyone here heard of
him?</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Batman is a major cause of crime in Gotham.
So-called super-villains seek him out hoping to prove themselves in
violent conflict. Batman does not deter crime, he invites it.</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: I’m sure our audience objects to your
gender bias. Batperson.</p>
<p><strong>aims</strong>: What is the Dark Knight’s credo? Batman does
not kill? What of those slain during his fight with Jack Napier aka
Joker? Or in his Christmas conflict with the orphan Cobblepot? Batman
belongs behind bars, not his morally disadvantaged victims.</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Which part of the word didn’t you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I could like this woman.</p>
<p><strong>149 chase 149</strong>: Batman is a <em>reaction</em> to the
crime in this city, not a creator of it! Without him many more would be
dead. Batman is a true hero…</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: Hey, Doc, got the hots for Batman?</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: What do you think? Call us at…</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Batman, Batman, Batman. God, we want that
man’s blood on our hands.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: Oh you are most obscene, my frightful
grotesque.</p>
<p><strong>lace</strong>: Don’t listen to her. You’re every girl’s
dream.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: Waste Dorothy and Toto here, you and me can
get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: Harder, baby. Hit me again.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: No. LEATHER Sadist.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Too many bats to fry to think about fun.
We wanna take him apart limb by hyper-extended limb. Feel his bones
crunch in our hands. Beat him until he’s as black and blue as that
ridiculous rubber suit.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: On the other hand, perhaps something slow,
a delicious incursion of despair, a campaign to shatter his psyche and
bring him crumbling to his knees.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Hell. Why wait? Rupture his organs.
Shatter his spine. Still have time for a late dinner.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: But simple murder? It’s just too damn
simple. Besides, it’s been done. No. We need a plan.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Yes. Something senseless, brutal, savage,
violent.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Yet witty.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How’s the sonar coming, Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: A few hitches sir, but I’m confident we’ll
have a prototype in no time.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’ll never work.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I believe you said the same thing about the
Batmobile.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Scholarly research?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She has an excellent mind.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: If I misinterpreted your interest in the
lady, I humbly apologize–</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I wonder if she’d go out with me.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Apology hastily retracted.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: They don’t understand. They think I became
Batman to fight crime.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Do you remember the night I fell into that
cave and the bat chased me?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Your parents’ wake. Rain fell like
tears.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …The night Batman was born. What was I doing
in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that
storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I don’t know, sir. Your dear parents.
Suddenly gone. So much loss…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those
eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me. In time I came to believe that
if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn’t be scared
anymore. I was wrong. They think I became Batman to fight crime. I
became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Perhaps it’s time you paid a bit more
attention to Bruce Wayne. There was no one at the door, just this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucertola</strong>: Ya wanna cough up your rent, or do I
post an eviction notice?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Mrs. Lucertola. What a surprise. Come in. I
was just sitting down to write the check.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucertola</strong>: What is it exactly that you do,
Mr. Nygma?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: My dear Ms. Lucertola. Italian, isn’t it?
For lizard. How fitting. I think the question better asked: what is it
that I don’t do?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Most recently I have devised a way to change
the destiny of mankind and the world as we know it, all in my favor of
course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucertola</strong>: The rent Nygma!!!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Might I persuade you to take a seat on this
couch? To indulge me in a little experiment?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucertola</strong>: Hey, I got no time for-</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Showtime.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucertola</strong>: My favorite story.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yes. TV. Balm to the minds of the masses.
The great deadener. If only it were more lively. But wait. I can
help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lucertola</strong>: Oh my lord.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Not quite. But I’m getting there.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Now this is much better. No pain. Just a
little holographic TV to keep your mind off the fact…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: …That I’m taking your mind. Not your
thoughts, mind you. Just your neural energy, simply sucking some IQ
points as it were.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: His intelligence jumps. Ms. Lizard don’t
know it. The crowd goes wild. Boys, I want one of these babies in every
home. It’s the new information super highway and, pay attention now
kids. I’m the on ramp. From their brains to the TV to my brain, with no
commercial interruptions! There are seven million brains in the Naked
City… …and they’re all mine!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Mr. Wayne. Chase Meridian.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Somebody’s been sending me love letters.
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Psychiatrists make you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just ones this beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut
off?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: On occasion. Usually at night.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Still play with dolls, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: She’s a Malaysian dream warden. She stands
sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams. Need one?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Me? No. Only things that need calming in my
dreams are the Rockettes.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: My opinion. This letter writer is a total
wacko.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Wacko? That a technical term?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Patient apparently suffers from acute
obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for
you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So what you’re saying, this guy’s a total
wacko, right?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You have a thing for bats?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: That’s a rorschach, Mr. Wayne. People see
what they want to.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I think the question would be, do you have a
thing for bats?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So, this Riddler, he’s dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What do you know about obsession?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s a stretch but I’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: The letter writer is obsessed with you. His
only escape may be…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: To kill me.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You understand obsession better than you let
on.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No insights here, doc. Just trying to get
comfortable on your couch. Oops. Times up.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: That’s usually my line.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Look, I’d love to keep chatting-</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Would you? I’m not so sure.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But I’m going to have to get you out of those
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And into a black dress.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?</p>
<p><strong>ringmaster</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen. Seventy feet above
the ground, performing feats of aerial skill without a net, the Flying
Graysons!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I’m surprised you aren’t blind by now.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m sorry. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Now we can just sit back and watch the show
like normal folks.</p>
<p><strong>ringmaster</strong>: Tonight’s benefit has raised $375,000
for Gotham Children’s Hospital. Let’s thank our largest single donor:
Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Like normal folks.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What? This isn’t normal?</p>
<p><strong>172 ringmaster 172</strong>: And now Richard, the youngest
Flying Grayson, will perform The <em>Quadruple</em> Flying
Somersault!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That kid is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I don’t get you Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Me? I’m easy. Especially after a couple of
martinis.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an
act, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t believe it. I’m just skin deep.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Look, I’m rock climbing Sunday. How about
coming along?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a
really great guy…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Well, I met someone…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Fast work. You just moved here.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You could say he kind of dropped out of the
sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He sure did.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I said I’m sure he did.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, and I do use the
term loosely, your attentions please. Tonight, a new act for your
amusement. We call it Massacre Under the Big Top.</p>
<p><strong>186 two-face 186</strong>: People, people. Show some grace
under pressure. A little decorum, please. <em>SHUT UP</em>!!!</p>
<p><strong>188 two-face 188</strong>: If we may direct your
attention…</p>
<p><strong>191 two-face 191</strong>: Inside that wooden box: two
hundred sticks of TNT. In our hand: a radio detonator.</p>
<p><strong>193 two-face 193</strong>: You have three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>194 the mayor 194</strong>: What the hell do you want?</p>
<p><strong>195 two-face 195</strong>: Want, Mr. Mayor? Just one little
thing. Batman. Bruised. Broken. Bleeding. In a word: dead.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Who do we have assembled before us?
Gotham’s finest. Rich, Influential. Smart. One of you must know who
Batman is. Hell, we’d lay odds one of you <em>is</em> Batman.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: So, unless the bat is surrendered to us
post haste, we’re off on a proverbial killing spree. City wide mayhem
and murder. Starting tonight. With all you lovely folks as our very
first corpses to be. You have three —well just under three— minutes.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Boys! Move, move, move! Cannot get good
help these days.</p>
<p><strong>199 chris 199</strong>: Go! We’ll hold them off!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Show’s over.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Day in, day out, it always comes down to
the same old question. Life… Or death.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Our kinda day.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Never did like the circus. Too many
freaks.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: No!!!!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: It’s good of you to take him in. He’s been
filling out forms all day. He hasn’t even eaten.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Welcome, Master Grayson. I’m Alfred.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: How ya doin’, Al?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Al?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Big house. How many rooms?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Gee, I’m not sure. Alfred? How many rooms?
Total?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Ninety-three, including the sauna.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Take any three you like. After you get
settled we can…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Okay. I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I figure telling that cop I’d stay here saved
me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense
but thanks. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Where will you go? The circus is halfway to
Metropolis by now.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I got no place at the circus without my
family. I’m going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I’m going to kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won’t take the
pain away. It’ll make it worse.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You’re just
some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don’t even know
me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s not just the sadness. Is it? The shame
is worse. Feeling like somehow you should have saved them.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You’re right. I don’t know you. But I’m like
you.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Oh, is the young master leaving? Pity. I’ll
just toss this away then. Perhaps the dogs are hungry -</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I’ll set this up in the guest suite. Just in
case.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Master Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s happening again. Just like my parents. A
monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed
them.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that
boy’s parents.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: No. You said I. I killed them.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Hey?.. Hello?… Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Commissioner…?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: He’s home. I sent the signal.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Last night at the circus. I noticed something
about Dent. His coin. He’s obsessed with justice. It’s his Achilles’
heel. It can be exploited.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You called me here for this? The Batsignal
is not a beeper.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I wish I could say my interest in you was
purely professional…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Are you trying to get under my cape,
Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: It’s the car, right? Chicks love the
car.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What is it about the wrong kind of man? In
grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather
jackets.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Now black rubber.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Try a fireman. Less to take off.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I don’t mind the work. Pity I can’t see
behind the mask.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: We all wear masks.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: My life’s an open book. You read?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I’m not the kind of guy who blends in at a
family picnic.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: We could give it a try. I’ll bring the wine,
you bring the scarred psyche.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You are direct, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You like strong women. I’ve done my homework.
Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I haven’t had much luck with women…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Maybe you just haven’t met the right
woman…</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I saw the beacon. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Nothing… False alarm.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Ever have one of those days where you just
want to kill someone?</p>
<p><strong>voice in the dark</strong>: Riddle me this.</p>
<p><strong>voice in the dark</strong>: The answer is, your enemy.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>voice in the dark</strong>: You can just call me… The
Riddler.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: How’d you find us?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: You <em>are</em> Two-Face, you would need
to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one
spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs…</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Congratulations. You get to die on the
dean’s list.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Has anyone ever told you have a serious
impulse control problem? You know, I simply love what you’ve done with
this place. Heavy Metal with just a touch of House and Garden.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: It’s so dark and Gothic and disgustingly
decadent…</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!
It’s so you. And yet so <em>you</em>! Very few people are both a summer
<em>and</em> a winter. But you pull it off nicely.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: A man with a death wish.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Harvey. You need me. Since you’ve gotten
out of Arkham, you’ve managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a
statue? And, correct me if I’m wrong here, but weren’t you outsmarted by
an acned acrobat at the circus?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Let’s see if you bleed green.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Alright, counselor. Go ahead. Fire away.
But before you do, let me ask you one question. Is it really me you want
to kill?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Do you know about hate, my dual visaged
friend? Slow, burning hate that keeps you sleepless until late in the
night, that wakes you before dawn. Do you know that kind of hate? I do.
Kill him? Seems like a good enough idea. But have you thought it
through? A few bullets, a quick spray of blood, a fast, thrilling rush,
and then what? Wet hands and post-coital depression. Is it really
enough? Why not ruin him first? Expose his frailty. And then, when he is
at his weakest, crush him in your hand.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: …Take a hit.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Up, up, up.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I
respect the sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: This is your brain on the box. This is your
brain on their brain.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: This is my brain on your brain on their
brain. Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: No. Wait…</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Addictive isn’t it? Just Say No. Until I
say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here’s the
concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather
production capital so I can produce enough of these to create an empire
that will eclipse Bruce Wayne’s forever. And, in return I will help you
solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: You are a very strange person. You speak
as if we are old friends, which we are not. You barge in here unarmed
when it is clearly suicidal to do so. Still, an intriguing proposition.
Heads: we take your offer.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Tails: we blow your <em>goddamned head
off</em>!</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: …working with Two-Face, Gotham’s new
criminal mastermind is calling himself The Riddler. Twenty million in
diamonds were stolen yesterday with no sign of Batman.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: In other news, entrepreneur Edward Nygma has
signed a lease for Claw Island. Nygma says he plans to break ground on
an electronics plant….</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Close your fist. Reach back.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Get it?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Riddler. You punch like a girl. Put some
heart into it.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Okay. Okay. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: May I help you, Master Grayson?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: How come this is the only locked door around
this museum? What’s back there?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Master Wayne’s dead wives.</p>
<p><strong>272 vondelle (on screen) 272</strong>: Has Batman lost his
touch? We’ve become a city of sissies crying Batman, Batman, Batman at
the first sign of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: I just love a captive audience.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Oh, but all I want is to take all your
jewels oh oh. No, oh you villain don’t take my jewels, oh no. I will. No
you won’t. I will. No you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Where are you sending Batboy this
time?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Here. Get a good seat.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Why sit back when you can be part of the
show?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: …Nygmatech brings the joy 3-D entertainment
into your own home.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen. Let me tell you my
vision for the future. “The Box” in every home in America. And one day,
the world.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Riddler and Two-Face are tweaking the data
before the computer pulls it off the emergency bands.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in
more than three dimensions. Then… Damn. Hit us again.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Haven’t you had enough? Don’t Think And
Drive.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Our Paleolithic yearnings are best
expressed in a pre-linguistic- Sorry. Just thinking out loud.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Not until you do that thing I like. On se
tue pour des mesnonges. J’ai gache ma vie… Woah. Harsh toke.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Don’t bogart that ’trode.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>riddler &amp; two-face</strong>: …Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>aims</strong>: This Box is nothing more than an electronic
narcotic.</p>
<p><strong>royce</strong>: Thousands more Gothamites each day are tuning
out by tuning in to its holographic fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>aims</strong>: It’s turning citizens into zombies…</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: Gripe, gripe, gripe. Isn’t this what they
said about TV? I think “The Box” is the future. What’s your opinion? I
want to know…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Master Dick?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Up here, Al.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Just checking, young sir.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Four seconds from…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The style of the letters I’m getting matches
those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me
riddles? Who’s your decorator? U-Haul?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Sorry. I haven’t even had time to unpack.
Instant coffee okay?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Call it clinical intuition. I thought your
dreams might need changing.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: My parents were murdered. In front of me. I
was just a kid.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces
missing. I can’t really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my
dreams. I’d kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them….</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: And now….</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: They’ve changed. The dreams, I mean. There’s
a new element I don’t understand. A book. Black. Covered in
leather….</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Damn. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Find anything interesting?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Why do I feel like the other man, here?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a
living.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’d say this goes a little beyond taking your
work home.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What do you want me to say? That I’m not
attracted to him?</p>
<p><strong>302 chase 302</strong>: Look at the abuse he’s taking. He’s
not just fighting criminals. He’s punishing himself.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: It’s as if he’s paying some great penance.
What crime could he have committed to deserve a life sentence of such
agony?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Maybe he just had a lousy childhood, is that
it Doc?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Why do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If
you’re jealous…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m not-</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You want me close but you won’t let me near.
What’s the terrible, dark secret you’re protecting everyone from?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: In a sense we are all two people. The side we
show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather
distressing news about Master Dick.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I’m afraid Master Dick has… gone
traveling.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He ran away?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Actually, he took the car.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He boosted the Jag? Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Not the Jaguar. The <em>other</em> car.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The <em>Rolls</em>?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: <em>No</em>, sir. <em>The</em>
<em>other</em> <em>car</em>!</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I’m Batman. Damn, did I forget to dress
again?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Chains. You don’t seem like the type.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: The Caped Crusader strikes again. Sans cape,
of course.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Another victory for the Dark Knight.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Dark nighty-night.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Is your will up to date?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I could definitely get behind this super hero
gig.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You forgot the part where you kiss the
girl.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Don’t you want my number?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I need to be part of this.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Me and my brother Chris were putting money
aside so our folks could retire. Dad’s knee was going. Chris was
engaged, you know that? Two-Face took…everything. Now I can pay him
back.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What I do isn’t about revenge.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Right, slick. Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This isn’t a game.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Back off, man.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You don’t understand. It’s an addiction. You
fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain’s
back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a
choice. I want better for you.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Save the sermons about how great you want my
life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren’t for Batman my parents wouldn’t be
dead. You don’t get it, do you? This is all your fault.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham
zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He’s protecting more than
industrial secrets, Alfred.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I shall be near at hand. Should you need me.
And sir, I know it’s difficult but try and have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were
sulking.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a
little rich for me.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Touchy, touchy.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So how goes your `scholarly’ pursuit of
Batman?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Oh God, Bruce. You’re still jealous.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You’re being
ridiculous. I can’t be jealous of Batman. Can I?</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: You’re outselling Wayne Enterprises. Any
comments?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Actually, I’m outselling Wayne Tech two to
one…</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: The Times has named you Gotham’s
bachelor of the year. What do you have to say about that?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You might want to ask Bruce Wayne. Bruce,
old man!</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: So glad you could come.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great
party-</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: The press were just wondering what it feels
like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way… And
what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Chase?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit
you must be. What do you think of my new invention?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What? Oh, it’s very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely
disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: No grape could be more intoxicating than
you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms. Skol.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Nostrovia.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: La’chiem.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Slanta.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Rinka.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Banzai.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I’m drinking.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I notice you’ve sub-divided your B coupons.
Feeling a little light on principle?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Actually, I like to divest just before a
major re-capitalization.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Excuse me, boys. I’d hate to stop this
testosterone flood on my account-</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Quite right. Shall we dance?</p>
<p><strong>showgirl</strong>: Naughty, naughty.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Alright, folks, this is an old- fashioned,
low-tech stick-up. We’re interested in the basics: jewelry, cash,
watches, high-end cellular phones. Hand ’em over nice and easy and no
one gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Emergency, Alfred.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: You’re ruining my big party. Are you insane?
Actually, considering your dual persona, let’s just forget the
question.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: We’re sick of waiting for you to deliver
The Bat, Riddle boy. You promised us Batman.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Patience, oh bifurcated one.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Screw patience. We want him dead. An
nothing brings out The Bat like a little mayhem and murder.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Oh well, in that case. As long as you were
going to rob me, you could have at least let me in on the caper. We
could have <em>organized</em> this, <em>planned it</em>, pre-sold the
movie rights.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Harv, babe, I gotta be honest. Your entrance
was good. His was better. What’s the difference? Showmanship.</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: Batman, Batman, Batman help!</p>
<p><strong>vondelle</strong>: Batman. You’re my <em>God</em>!!!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Okay boys. Phase two.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Bat’s right behind us.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Nothing worse than a bad case of gas.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Lights. Camera. Action.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Why won’t you just die?!</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Boys, let’s go have us a party. Anybody
else feel like donuts?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What the hell did you think you were
doing?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You have a real gratitude problem. You know
that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What’s a good side
kick name?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How about Richard Grayson, college
student?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: …I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we
catch him, you gotta let me kill him!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We don’t kill. Killing is what damns you.
It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You’re going
away to school.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I saved your life. You owe me. So either you
let me be your partner or I’m going after Harvey on my own.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s starting all over again, Alfred. Another
boy lost to rage. And it’s my fault. If Harvey hadn’t come gunning for
me at the circus…His family…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Maybe they’re right.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Which `they’ might that be, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Jack Napier’s dead. My parents are avenged.
The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime
prevention programs.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Why do I keep doing this?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Why, indeed?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me.
Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Dr. Meridian…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She’s the first woman in a long time that’s…
No. She’s the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne.
If I let go of Batman I’ll lose her.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the
lady?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as
Bruce Wayne and hope…?</p>
<p><strong>phone</strong>: Hello?..Hello?..Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Who am I Alfred? I don’t think I know
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t believe it. I’ve imagined
this moment since I first saw you. Your hands. Your face. Your body.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: And now I have you and…. Guess a girl has to
grow up sometime.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I’ve met someone. He’s not…you. But… I hope
you can understand.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: You know, Ed, we woke up this morning, we
just knew we were gonna kill something. The Bat got away. Looks like
it’s gonna be you.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Why do we need you? You only come between
us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for
ourselves. Time’s up, laughing boy.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the
empire. All yours. Hell, Harv, old pals. I’ll kill me for you.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Too…bad…about…Batman.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: What about Batman?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: What if you could know a man’s mind? Would
you not then own that man?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: A few dozen extra IQ points and my little
invention learned a new trick. It does more than drain your brain. It
makes a map of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Would you like to see what my old friend
Bruce has in his head.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Riddle me this, what kind of man has bats
on the brain?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Go ahead. You can say it.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: You’re a genius.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Happy Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Happy Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: …Tonight it ends.</p>
<p><strong>387 dick (over) 387</strong>: What the hell do you mean, it
ends?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: From this day on, Batman is no more.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You can’t-.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive.
Trust me. I know.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: But what about all the good we can do? There
are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And when you finally get Two-Face?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Exactly. And once you’d killed him you’d be
lost. Like me. All this has to be a choice. Otherwise…it’s a curse.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Bruce, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Chase is coming for dinner. Why don’t you
join us.</p>
<p><strong>392 riddler 392</strong>: And today not even my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Bruce, Batman. Bruce, Batman.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: There’s something I want to talk with you
about. It’s…Well, we.. I…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give
me your pin or something?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Let me go first, okay? I think I’ve found
something. About your dreams. I pulled the files on your parents’
murders. There was a missing diary, Bruce. Alfred told the police your
father always kept it on his desk. But the day after the murders, it was
gone. Maybe that’s the book you’re-</p>
<p><strong>398 chase 398</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Flashes. Images. Of that night.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Your memories are repressed. They’re trying
to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t want to remember!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Stop fighting.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: My parents are laid out in the library. Their
skin smells like talcum powder. I’m so small. My father’s diary is on
his desk like always. I’m opening the book. Reading. I’m running out
into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can’t hear my screams over
the rain. I’m falling…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce?
What does the book say?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t-.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You do know. Try.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing
a movie tonight. Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me
to the movie. To that theater… It was my fault. I killed them.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren’t
responsible.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …Not the bat?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I always thought it was the bat that scared
me that night that changed my life. But it wasn’t. The real fear was
hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents’ deaths
were my fault. That’s what I couldn’t remember. That’s the crime I’ve
been paying for all these years.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Chase. There’s something I need to tell
you–</p>
<p><strong>little voice</strong>: Trick or Treat?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Trick.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Get the girl.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: What’s that I hear?</p>
<p><strong>406 riddler 406</strong>: Why it must be the fat lady getting
ready to sing.</p>
<p><strong>410 riddler 410</strong>: Gonna have a hot time in the old
town tonight. Who used to say that? Somebody always used to say
that.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Bruce, you sure know how to throw a
party.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Sheath your weapon my impetuous cohort.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: We want to dust him. We truly want to dust
him bad.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Oh yes, and certainly <em>WE</em> will!</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: My poor sweet hero.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: We’ll kill him alright. But first…
Boys.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Bruce!</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: …We’re going to make him suffer.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The injuries are relatively minor. The shot
did cause a concussion. Watch for headaches. Memory lapses. Odd
behavior. I’ll check back in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: How are you feeling, young man?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not that young. It’s been a long time since
you’ve called me that.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Old habits die hard. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me
the bad news.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Dick has run away. They have taken
Dr. Meridian. And I’m afraid they found the cave, sir. It’s been
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The case? What cave?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: The Mayor’s called again. He’s not going to
show. Maybe he’s hurt sir. Maybe he’s–.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: No! …No.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m Batman? I remember my life as Bruce
Wayne. But all this. It’s like the life of a stranger.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Perhaps the fall…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: There’s one other thing. I feel..</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …Afraid.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind
man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …A bat.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing
me. Oh my God, Alfred.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: No demons, son. Your monsters are here.
Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: It’s happy time Gotham. Have you hugged
your little boxes today? I’m in heaven. I’m in heaven with a girl like
you.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Batman will come for me.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Someday my bat will come. Some day my bat
will come. I’m counting on it.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You’re frying your brain.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Nap time gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But Martha and I have our hearts set on
Zorro, so Bruce’s cartoon will have to wait until next week.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …Not my fault. It wasn’t my fault.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Master, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: …Batman, Alfred. I’m Batman.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: All the answers are numbers.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: But 1, 3, 1, 8, &amp; 5. What do they
mean?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What do maniacs always want?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Recognition, of course.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Precisely. So this number is probably some
kind of calling card.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Letters in the alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Of course. 13 is M….MRE.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: How about, MR. E.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Mystery.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And another name for Mystery?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Enigma.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good thing Mr. E. didn’t know about the cave
under the cave.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What now sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Claw Island. Nygma’s headquarters. I’m sure
that’s where they’re keeping Chase. Are all the Batsuits destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: All except the prototype with the sonar
modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn’t yet been tested.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Tonight’s a good night.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: What do you suggest, Alfred. By see or by
air?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Why not both?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Dick… Where did you get that suit?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I…um..took the liberty, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I thought you could use a friend.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Not a friend.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: A partner.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: He’s not coming. Shut it down.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: A-14.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Miss.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: B-12.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might
add.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: A hit.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: You sunk my battleship.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Holy rusted metal, Batman.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: The ground. It’s metal and its full of holes.
You know. Holey.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: This place was a refueling station for subs
during the war…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Dick.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: The Bat or the Bird. We couldn’t decide
who got to kill who. Or is it whom?</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: We flipped for it. We got you.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: What’s wrong, circus-boy? No mommy and
daddy to save you?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: For my mother.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: For my father.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: For Chris.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: For me.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: The scales are tipped. The blindfold torn
from the lady’s eyes. Justice will be served.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: You’re a man after my own heart, son.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: See you in hell.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: No. I’d rather see you in jail.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: The Bat’s taught you well. Noble.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: A mistake. But definitely noble.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to
the Bat. How’s tricks?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and
Dick. This is between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: And me and me.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: …Of course. The Box does more than enhance
neural energy. You’ve been sucking Gotham’s brainwaves.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: And now it’s new. Improved. Better than
ever.</p>
<p><strong>496 batman 496</strong>: …The jolt I felt in the beam at your
party. You’ve devised a way to map the human brain. To read men’s
minds.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Oh, Bruce, you are clever. How fitting that
numbers lead you to me. For numbers will crown me king. My Box will sit
on countless TV’s around the globe, mapping brains, giving me credit
card numbers. Bank codes. Safe combinations. Numbers of infidelities. Of
crimes. Of lies told. No secret is safe from my watchful electronic eye.
I will rule the planet. For if knowledge is power then tremble world,
Edward Nygma has become a God. Was that over the top? I can never tell…
By the way, B-man, I got <em>your</em> number.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: I’ve seen your mind. Yours is the greatest
Riddle of all. Can Bruce Wayne and Batman ever truly coexist? Stop me if
I’m wrong here.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: So let’s help you decide, once and for all,
who you really are. Behind Curtain #1…</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: The captivating Dr. Chase Meridian. Love of
Bruce Wayne’s life. Behind curtain #2…</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Batman’s one and only partner. Below, my
personal favorite…</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: A watery grave!</p>
<p><strong>502 riddler 502</strong>: A simple touch and five seconds
later these two day players are so much gull feed on the rocks below.
Not enough time to save them both. So who will it be? Bruce’s love?
Batman’s partner? You decide. Is this fun or what?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Edward, you’ve become a monster.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: You flatter me. No monster. Just The
Riddler, and here’s yours. What is without taste or sound, all around,
but can’t be found? On your mark, get set…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Death. Death. Without taste, sound and all
around us. Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This
is one giant death trap.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber
suit can’t be smart? Well, it’s been grand. Sorry you all have to die
now.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Wait. I have a riddle for you.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: For <em>me</em>? Really? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as
clear as daylight. What am I?</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Oh please. You’re blind as a bat.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Exactly!</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: All those heroics for nothing. No more
riddles, no more curtains one and two. Just plain old curtains.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Haven’t you forgotten something, Harvey?
You’re always of two minds about everything….</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: Oh. Emotion is so often the enemy of
justice. Thank you, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>two-face</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Help Chase. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Did Two-Face call him Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>riddler</strong>: Why can’t I kill you? Now there’s a riddle?
Not smart enough. Find a way. Too many questions. Why you and not me?
Why me? Why??!!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Poor, Edward. I had to save them both. You
see, I am Bruce Wayne and Batman. Not because I have to be. Now because
I choose to be.</p>
<p><strong>dr. burton</strong>: Edward Nygma has been screaming for
hours that he knows the true identity of Batman.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Edward…</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: It’s Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember
me?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: How could I forget?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman
is.</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Yesssssss. I know!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Who is The Batman, Edward?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: Can’t tell if you don’t say please.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You’re right, Edward. I didn’t mean to be
impolite. Please.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Edward, please. Who is Batman?</p>
<p><strong>edward</strong>: I AM BATMAAAAAAANN!!!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Mr. Wayne sent me to pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Where’s Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: He asked me to convey his deepest apologies,
Dr. Meridian. But he wanted me to give you this.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: He said to thank you. And to tell you he no
longer needs it.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Does it ever end Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: No, Miss. Not in this lifetime.</p>
