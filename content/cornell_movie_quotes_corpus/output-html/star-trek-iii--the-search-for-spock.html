<p><strong>spock</strong>: Space… the final frontier.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: These are the continuing voyages of the
Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: To explore strange new worlds… To seek out
new life forms, and new civilizations… To boldly go, where no man has
gone before…</p>
<p><strong>“the genesis planet.</strong>: STARDATE: 8001.3”</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: We are approaching destination planet at
point zero three five. So noted in ship’s log.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Very well, Lieutenant. Execute standard
orbital approach.</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Standard orbit, aye.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Communications. Send a coded message for
Starfleet Commander, priority one… “Federation Science Vessel Grissom
arriving Genesis Planet, Mutara Sector to begin search. As ordered, full
security procedures are in effect. J.T. Esteban, commanding.”</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: Aye sir, coding now.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Dr. Marcus, it’s your planet.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you, Captain. Begin scanning,
please.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: This is where the fun begins, Saavik!</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Like your father… so human. All units
functional, recorders are on… Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully
developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two
Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sector two… Indicating desert terrain.
Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Sector three… Sub-tropical vegetation…
Temperature – Temperature decreasing rapidly –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s snow. Snow in the same sector.
Fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: … Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: All the varieties of land and weather known
to Earth within a few hours walk!</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: You must be very proud of what you and your
mother have created.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s a little early to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Same sector. Metallic mass.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Underground deposit?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Negative, on surface… A manufactured
object.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There’s only one thing it could be… Short
range scan.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Approximately two meters long… Cylindrical
in form…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: A photon tube…!</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Could it be Spock’s?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It has to be. Gravitational fields were in
flux… It must have soft landed…!</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: In code to STARFLEET… Captain’s Spock’s
tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on
subsequent orbits.</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: Yes sir… Coding your message.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: USS Enterprise, Captain’s personal log… With
most of our battle damage repaired, we are almost home. Yet, I feel –
uneasy. And I wonder why.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Perhaps it is the erratic behavior of Ship’s
surgeon McCoy… Or the emptiness of this vessel: most of our trainee crew
have been reassigned; Lieutenant Saavik and my son David are exploring a
new world… and Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone…
No. More empty even than that…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The news of Spock’s tube has shaken me. It
seems that I have left the noblest part of myself back there, on that
newborn planet.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Status, Mr. Sulu?</p>
<p><strong>6 omitted 6</strong>: &amp; &amp; 7 7</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in
two point one hours.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Very well. Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach
scan… Take the science station, please.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our
Project Genesis inquiries?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: No, sir, no response.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hmm.. Very odd. Scotty. Progress report?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I’m almost done, sir. You’ll be fully
automated by the time we dock.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You’ve
fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time
till we can take her out again?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Eight weeks, sir. But you don’t have eight
weeks so I’ll do it for ya in two.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your
repair estimates by a factor of four?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my
reputation as a miracle worker?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Your reputation is secure, Scotty. Mr. Sulu,
take the con. I’ll be in my quarters.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Aye sir.</p>
<p><strong>trainee foster</strong>: Sir… I was wondering…</p>
<p><strong>trainee foster</strong>: Are they planning a ceremony when we
get in…? I mean, a reception…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: A hero’s welcome, son? Is that what you’d
like?… Well, God knows, there should be. This time we paid for the party
with our dearest blood.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Bones.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Are you planning to shave today?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ll be orbiting Earth in two hours.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, don’t do this. This is me. Jim. Your
friend.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Damn it, Bones, don’t quote Spock to me! I
have enough pain of my own and I don’t need your – self- indulgence!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … What the hell are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones!… You must deal with the truth! He’s
gone. Spock is gone. And we both have to live with that.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Steady… Steady, boys. Keep scanning… I
thought you people were reliable… Where the hell is he!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He has been here for some time. I can feel
his presence.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Don’t give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo –
there ain’t another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Put me on the hailing frequency.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Sure - whatever games you wanna play.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Commander Kruge: this is Valkris. I have
obtained the Federation data, and am ready to transmit.</p>
<p><strong>15 int. bridge - bird of prey (cloak effect) - close -
15</strong>: KRUGE’S PET</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Well done, Valkris… Stand by.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Well done, Valkris…Transmit data on my
command… Now!</p>
<p><strong>19 int. bridge - bird of prey - (intercut with 19</strong>:
MERCHANTMAN)</p>
<p><strong>valkris</strong>: Transmission completed. You will find it
essential to your mission.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What’s going on? When do we get paid
off…?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Soon, Captain… Quite soon.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>25 int. bird of prey - (intercut as needed with 25</strong>:
MERCHANTMAN)</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: For God’s sake, help us! Please! We’ll keep
your damn secrets, just don’t let us die in space!</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: I’ll be in my quarters. Execute course to the
Federation Boundary.</p>
<p><strong>maltz</strong>: Yes, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: New orbit commencing… Coming up on sector
three…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Short range scan.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: As before… Metallic mass… Verifying
triminium photon tube… No new data.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Check for trace radiation. Infrared
enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: … Radiation residual… Level is minimal…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t believe it…</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: If equipment is functioning properly,
indications are – an animal life form.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: You said there wouldn’t be any.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: There <u>shouldn’t</u> be any. Only plant
forms were built into the Genesis matrix.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Cross referenced and verified. An
unidentifiable life form reading.</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: Do you wish to advise Starfleet,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Wait a minute…! We don’t know what we’re
talking about here…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Why don’t we beam it up?</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Oh no you don’t! Regulations specifically
state: “nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has
been eliminated.” Can you guarantee that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Not from here, no.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Captain… the logical alternative is obvious…
beaming down to the surface is permitted…</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: “… If the Captain decides that the mission
is vital and reasonably free of danger.” I know the book, Saavik.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Captain, please – we’ll take the risk. We’ve
<u>got</u> to find out what it is…</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: … Or <u>who</u>.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: All right – get your gear. I’ll put you
down next time around.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Thank you… <u>Sir</u>!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Standby automatic approach system … Advise
approach control.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Approach control… this is Enterprise. Ready
for docking maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Enterprise is cleared to dock.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Lock on!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Systems locked.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spacedock, you have control.</p>
<p><strong>controller</strong>: Affirmative, Enterprise. Enjoy the ride,
and welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enterprise confirms. With thanks…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Would you look at that?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior,
ready for trial runs…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: She’s supposed to have transwarp drive…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Aye. And if my grandmother had wheels, she’d
be a wagon.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Scott…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, but as far as I’m concerned,
there’s nothin’ needed for space travel that this old girl doesn’t
already have.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.
Be tolerant.</p>
<p><strong>36 int. spacedock - the cafeteria (fx shot with ilm
36</strong>: ELEMENTS)</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Enterprise, stand by for final docking
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Standing by… Mr. Sulu, activate moorings…
Stand by umbilical and gravitational support systems…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Aye, sir, moorings activated… All systems
standing by…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Admiral… This is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov – ?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: An energy reading from ’C” deck – from
inside Mr. Spock’s quarters…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock’s quarters
sealed!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself.
Nevertheless – I am reading a life form there.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov – this entire crew seems on the
edge of obsessive behavior concerning Mr. Spock. I’ll have a look…
Mr. Sulu, continue docking procedure.</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: Jim… Help me… take me… up the steps… of
Mount Seleya… through the hall of ancient thought…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, what the hell are you doing? Have you
lost your mind!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s where we are, Bones. we are home.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mount Seleya? Bones, Mount Seleya is on
Vulcan! We’re home on Earth!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Admiral: docking is completed. Starfleet
Commander Morrow is on his way for inspection.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura! Get the medics down here! Get them
now!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, it’s all right…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Tetsch-hut!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Welcome aboard, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Welcome home, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you, sir. I take it this is not a formal
inspection.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: No. At ease, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Where’s Doctor McCoy?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Indisposed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Ah, too bad… Well… You have all done
remarkable service under the most – difficult of conditions. You’ll be
receiving Starfleet’s highest commendations, and more importantly,
extended shore leaves.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: That is, all but you, Mr. Scott. They need
your wisdom on the new Excelsior… Report there tomorrow as Captain of
Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: With all appreciation, sir, I’d prefer to
supervise the refit of Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Yes, well… That really won’t be
necessary…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: But sir – this refit will take a practiced
hand. There’s much to do – It could be <U>months</U>.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: No, Mr. Scott, I’m sorry… There isn’t going
to be a refit.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Admiral, I don’t understand. The Enterprise
–</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We
think her day is over…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But, we had requested – we were hoping to take
her back to Genesis…</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Genesis?! Whatever for?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why – a natural desire to help finish the work
we began!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: That’s out of the question. No one is going
to Genesis!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: May I ask why…?</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a
galactic controversy… Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are
all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis…
Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s image</strong>: To fully understand the events on
which I report, it is necessary to review the theoretical data on the
Genesis Device…</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: So! Speak!</p>
<p><strong>torg</strong>: Great power… to control… dominate… destroy. If
it works.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Speak.</p>
<p><strong>matlz</strong>: Impressive… They con make planets…
Possibilities are endless… Colonies, resources…</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Yes… New cities, homes in the country… your
woman at your side… children playing at your feet… and overhead,
fluttering in the breeze… the flag of the Federation. Charming…
Station!</p>
<p><strong>maltz</strong>: Yes, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: It works. Oh yes, it works.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “… It was this premature detonation of the
Genesis device that resulted in the creation of the Genesis planet…”</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Share this with no one.</p>
<p><strong>torg</strong>: Understood, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: We are going to this “planet.” Even as our
emissaries negotiate for “peace” with the Federation, we will <U>act</U>
for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this
weapon. The secret of ultimate power!</p>
<p><strong>torg</strong>: Success, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Station!</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Transporter room, stand by to energize…</p>
<p><strong>50 ext. surface of the genesis planet - (beam down
50</strong>: EFFECT)</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of
soil samples for geological aging.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll handle that later.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: My readings indicate great instability.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We’re not here to investigate geological
aging, we’re here to find life forms!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>52 int. grissom bridge - favoring esteban (intercut
52</strong>: WITH SAAVIK)</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Grissom to landing party. We have you
approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well
below danger level.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant.
This landing is Captain’s discretion and I’m the one who’s out on a
limb.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: I’ll try to remember that, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: . .. Spock’s tube…</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: David –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well. There’s your life form reading. These
were microbes on the tube’s surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.
They were fruitful, and multiplied.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: But… How could they have evolved so
quickly…?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Saavik… He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Spock’s burial robe.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Absent friends.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: … Admiral, what’s going to happen to
Enterprise?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: She’s to be decommissioned.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Will we get another ship?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I can’t get an answer. Starfleet is up to its
brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand…
and wait.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: How is Doctor McCoy, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s the good news. He’s home in bed, full
of tranquilizers, and he promised me he’d <U>stay</U> there… They say
it’s exhaustion… We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ah. Mr. Scott, fresh from the world of
transwarp drive… Come!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sarek!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Ambassador, I – I had no idea you were here… I
think you know my crew…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: I will speak with you alone, Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Excuse us, please.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sarek… I would have come to Vulcan… to express
my deepest sympathies…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have
been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your
own report.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then you know how bravely your son met his
death.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: “Met his death”? How could you, his friend,
have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you –
and you denied him his future!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I – saw no future –</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: You missed the point, then and now… Only his
body was “in death,” Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes, I was…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Then you must know that you should have come
with him to Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But – why?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Because he asked you to! He entrusted you
with his very essence – with everything was not of the body. He asked
you to bring him to us – and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra.
His living spirit.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can
know. I’d have given my life if it would have saved his. You must
believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: He would not have spoken of it openly.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then, how –</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join
your mind?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Of course…!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: … He spoke of your friendship.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: He asked you not to grieve…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Yes…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: … The needs of the many outweigh…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … The needs of the few…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: … Or the one.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Spock…</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: I have been… and always shall be… your
friend. Live long… and prosper!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … No…! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly
shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches
Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had
mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body’s end is
near.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But he couldn’t touch me…! We were
separated!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: I see… and I understand. Then everything that
he was… Everything that he knew… is lost. And when I return home
empty-handed, many shall mourn.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Please wait!… Surely he would have found a
way! If there was so much at stake – Spock would have found a way!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Yes… But – how…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sarek!… What if he melded with someone
else?!</p>

<p><strong>sarek</strong>: One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What must I do?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: You must bring them to Mount Selaya – on
Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find
peace…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What you ask is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them
both, you <U>must</U>.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I will. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: We hear it whenever the ground quakes.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life
sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to
investigate.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: We concur, Saavik. And Saavik… be advised
we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I’m
getting nervous…</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Do you have an explanation?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Later. Let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will
advise… Out.</p>

<p><strong>morrow</strong>: No. Absolutely not, Jim, it’s out of the
question!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Harry. I’m off the record now. I’m not
speaking as one of your staff. I’m talking about thirty years of
service. I have to do this, Harry. It has to do with my honor, my life –
everything I put any value on.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Jim… You are my best officer and if I had a
best friend, you’d be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I
don’t break rules!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Don’t quote rules, Harry! We’re talking about
loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep
emotional damage –</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Now wait a minute! This business about Spock
and McCoy… Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism – I’m
sorry! But part of me doesn’t want you to make a fool of yourself…
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Harry, you don’t have to believe! I’m not even
sure I believe. But if there’s even a chance that Spock has an eternal
soul – then that is my responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Yours…?!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: As surely as if it were my own! Harry, give me
back the Enterprise! With Scotty’s help…</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the
pounding.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then I’ll find a ship – I’ll hire a ship.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Out of the question! The Council has ordered
that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then let me speak to the Council! Harry,
<U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: No, <U>you</U> understand…! The Council has
its hands full with Klingons and Romulans! They’re trying to hammer out
a treaty on the Genesis Device and they haven’t got time for your
personal views on friendship and metaphysics! Jim! Your life and your
career stand for rationality, not intellectual chaos. Keep up this
emotional behavior and you’ll lose everything. You’ll destroy yourself!
Do you hear me, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes… I hear you. I just had to try.</p>
<p><strong>morrow</strong>: Of course… Now take my suggestion, enjoy
your leave – and let all this tension blow away.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’re right. Thanks for the drink.</p>

<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Saavik… Does Dr. Marcus think there could
be – any chance of – ah – radioactive contamination?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: None that I can detect, sir.</p>
<p><strong>esteban</strong>: Well, all the same, I’m going to advise
Starfleet and get instructions.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: I’m sure Starfleet would approve, sir.</p>

you want – There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very

<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Very good.</p>

We have to get thee hell off this planet!</p>

<p><strong>saavik</strong>: I have already made one transmission too

planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Protomatter. An unstable substance which
every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously
unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It was the only way to solve certain problems
–</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Did your collaborator know?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: My mother knew nothing about it. That’s why I
asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: So, like your father, you changed the
rules…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: If I hadn’t, it might have been years – or
never!</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: And how many have paid the price for your
impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done… And what
is yet to come?</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: You got a visitor, Doc. Make it quick,
Admiral. They’re moving him to the Federation funny farm.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes, poor friend. I hear he’s fruity as a

<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Shhh. How many fingers up?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Good, your sense of humor’s returned.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’re suffering from a Vulcan mind meld,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Give me your arm. This will make you well
enough to travel. How do you do this anyway?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Where’s Admiral Kirk?</p>
<p><strong>guard 1</strong>: He’s with the prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Get him quickly. Commander, Starfleet wants
him right away.</p>

him, his visitor’s just leaving. What? Well, some Admiral name of –
Kirk. Well how am I supposed to know – ? He’s a damn <u>Admiral</u>!</p>

well.</p>

<p><strong>uhura</strong>: How is that…?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask
for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind
end of space.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Peace and quiet appeals to me,
Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Well, maybe that’s okay for someone like
you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my
life. Some adventure… Even just a surprise or two.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful
what you wish for: you may get it.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Gentlemen. Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.</p>

famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!</p>

orders, no encoded i.d…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: All true.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Well – what are we going to do about
it?!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u>
are going to sit in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all
sense of reality?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: This isn’t reality. This is fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: You wanted adventure? How’s this? The old
adrenalin going? Good boy. Now get in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Will you be able to handle that…?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Oh, I’ll have “Mr. Adventure” eating out of
my hand. And I’ll see you at the rendezvous. All my hopes.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: As promised, she’s all yours, sir. All
systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run
her.</p>

that personally. My friends… I can’t ask you to go any further.

before they can fire.</p>

ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit
there.</p>

<p><strong>kruge</strong>: They know we would die first.</p>
<p><strong>maltz</strong>: My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to

<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Put him on screen! Study him well.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s image</strong>: This is Admiral James T. Kirk of the
Federation Starship Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: So! The Genesis Commander himself!</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s image</strong>: … By violation of treaty between the
Federation and Klingon Empire, your presence here is an act of war. You
have two minutes to surrender your crew and your vessel, or we will
destroy you.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: He’s hiding something. We may have dealt him
a more serious blow than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>torg</strong>: How can you tell that?</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: I trust my instincts. Admiral Kirk. This is
your opponent speaking.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Do not lecture me about treaty violations.
The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of
Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you. On
the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed
your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will
execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who is this?! How dare you –</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Who I am is not important. That I have them
is. I will let you speak to them.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Saavik… Is… David with you?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan
scientist of your acquaintance.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: This Vulcan – is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: He is not himself – but he lives. He is
subject to rapid aging – like this unstable planet.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello, sir. It’s David.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: David… Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s okay – I should have known you’d come…
Saavik’s right: this planet is unstable. It’s going to destroy itself in
a matter of hours.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: David!… What went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: David, I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. Just don’t surrender. Genesis
doesn’t work! I can’t believe they’ll kill us for it –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: David?… David!</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I
meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere… I am
going to kill one of the prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Wait! Give me a chance –</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Saavik?!… David…!?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Admiral. David is dead.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You Klingon bastard! You’ve killed my
<U>son</U>…!</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you
want them killed too? Surrender your vessel!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All right, damn you! All right! Give me a
minute to inform my crew.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant
crew. Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!</p>
<p><strong>torg</strong>: They outnumber us, my Lord –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a
Bird of Prey?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: About a dozen officers and men.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: With some on the planet…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I swear to you, we’re not finished yet.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, you and Sulu to the transporter room.
The rest with me. We have a job to do.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board
this ship on my next signal.</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No tricks. I’m looking forward to meeting you.

<p><strong>kruge</strong>: I underestimated him… He did the one thing I
didn’t anticipate … He destroyed himself…</p>
<p><strong>maltz</strong>: Sir, may I –</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made
Kirk willing to die.</p>
<p><strong>maltz</strong>: We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps
their information –</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I
let him slip away.</p>
<p><strong>maltz</strong>: But surely, our mission has not failed –
?</p>
<p><strong>kruge</strong>: Our mission is over. I have failed… A human
has been bolder and more ruthless than I… That – is the real

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: My son… “To thee no star be dark… Both Heaven
and Earth… Friend thee forever…”</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What happened…?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: He gave his life to save us. That is all I
know.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!</p>

I’m sorry about your crew, old boy, but – c’est la vie, as we say on
Earth…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well? I’m waiting for you!… What is your
answer?! I have what you want. I have the secret of Genesis… But you’ll

Standby…</p>

<p><strong>kruge</strong>: No.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I lied.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Estimating Vulcan at point one niner.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Saavik: message to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him
we bring McCoy and a living Spock. Ask him to prepare for the Katra
ritual.</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Yes, Admiral. But that may not be
possible.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What? What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock’s
consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But we have Spock alive! That’s more than we
bargained for!</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor
Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to
attempt it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And if they don’t.? What will Happen to
Spock?</p>
<p><strong>saavik</strong>: . He will remain always as he is.</p>

The body of your son breathes still. What is your wish?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: I ask for Fal-Tor-Pan, the refusion.</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: What you seek has not been done since
ages past – and then, only in legend. Your request is not logical.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Forgive me, T’Lar. My logic falters where my
son is concerned.</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: Who is the Keeper of the Katra?</p>
<p><strong>priestess</strong>: McCoy… Son of David. Since thou art
human, we cannot expect thee to understand fully what Sarek has
requested. The circumstances are extraordinary: Spock’s body lives… With
your approval, we shall use all our powers to return to his body that
which you possess: his essence. But McCoy… You must now be warned! the
danger to thyself is as grave as the danger to Spock. You must make the
choice.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What I have done, I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: But at what cost? Your ship… Your son.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If I hadn’t tried, the cost would have been my
soul.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I know you… Do I not?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes. And I know you.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: My father says you have been my friend… You
came back for me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You would have done the same for me.</p>

needs of the many.</p>

friend.</p>
