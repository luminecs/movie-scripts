<h1 id="new-york-minute">new-york-minute</h1>
<p><strong>new york minute</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>ext. suburban street - dawn</strong>: CLOSE ON the anxious,
sweating, frightened face of DREW MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life.
Think Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man – someone, something – is after her
but UNSEEN. She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer, her
BREATHING becoming more labored. Cutting through a deserted park, she
leaps a bench. Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves. Around the corner, she’s back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her racing FOOTSTEPS
and quickening BREATHS.</p>
<p><strong>drew’s pov - her own front door</strong>: and safety loom
half a block down. She pours on the effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the
stairs and makes the door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it
shut.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the shrub</strong>: where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND
LEVEL, a GOLDEN RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!</p>
<p><strong>drew’s pov</strong>: The puppy squeezes through the hedge,
wiggling its bum to extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up,
hugs it close:</p>
<p><strong>six-year-old girl</strong>: Where are you going, Jelly
Bean?</p>
<p><strong>wagging.</strong>: From under piles of clothes and sheets,
PARKER MacLEOD, 17, Drew’s twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
shrieking ALARM CLOCK. With a SIGH, she throws her feet over the edge of
the bed. Her room is a train wreck. Grabbing a MatchBox 20 T-shirt from
the pile on the bed, she gives it a sniff. Good enough. Pulling it on,
she pauses, looks a bit concerned down at her navel. A recent
belly-button piercing looks a little red. She touches it. Ouch. When a
RINGING is heard, she begins tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to
unearth the source. She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:</p>
<p><strong>thoreau 786: made critical error last p.m.</strong>: Parker
snickers, types her return from…</p>
<p><strong>course around 3:00 a.m.</strong>: This makes her smile.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She leans in again and plucks one from
the other eyebrow. Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until you’re shaved. She reaches for the
other side… but suddenly catches herself and stops. Deep breath. Let’s
not get too psychotic. She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then
replaces them. Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit. Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Why the young executive look?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I have my interview at NYU today.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No way Mom knows about that.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: And she never will. At least until after I’m
married.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Didn’t it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Like hell.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Piercings are so… unhygienic.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>love to meet. gotta go.</strong>: Accompanying the text, a
PICTURE Warren has sent finishes downloading – eighteenish, the shaggy
chic, Calvin Klein model-type.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hellooo, Warren.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed
professionally and obviously together even at this hour, pours coffee
for herself and her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still
in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head. As a matter of
routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he takes it, kisses her and sits
down to the paper.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Morning, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Morning, baby.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: How’s the book coming?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Well, sweety, my writing process is a lot
like a giant hydroelectric dam. For a long time I just let the great
ideas build up and build up until the sheer weight of them spills over
and the words just come pouring out.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Still stuck, huh?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Not a word.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Another one for the trophy room, huh?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Boys can be fun. You should try one some
time.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You ready for your interview?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ve prepared a color-coded itinerary based on
dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue/red,
double- checked the train schedule, confirmed with the Weather Channel
and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night, you know, just
to account for all the possible glitches.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’ll take that as a yes.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I’m proud of you for sticking to your plan
all these years, sweety.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I still don’t understand why you want to
finish college in two years? What’s the big hurry?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I want to hit the ground running. All those
football games and the partying and the whole dating scene. It just
seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more
productively.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: The Accelerated program would look great on
your med school application.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Football games I get. But partying? A waste
of time?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: To each her own.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Well, Drew. I have a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I took the day off. I’m going into the City
with you.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What – ?!</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Isn’t that great! We can do some shopping,
have lunch, real girl stuff. Won’t that be fun?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: If you want to have fun, I’m the one who
should go, not Mother Teresa over there.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Let me know if you want me to do the
Heimlich. It’d be cool to have you owe me your life.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No… I mean, it’s… impossible. I’ve got every
minute accounted for right up to the interview. Blue and red! It won’t
work.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I just thought… you know… I’ve been working
and we haven’t had a chance to spend much time together…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D.,
is tearing up.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: … and both my babies are going away to
college next Fall.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Don’t be sad, Mom. Just think, when Drew
leaves for school, you won’t be losing a daughter, you’ll be losing an
anal-retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a
virgin.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m sorry, Mom. It’s really sweet of you. But
don’t worry. Parker will be living here with you forever since no
college on earth will ever take her.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Stop it, you two.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s not fair you guys get to go into the
City and I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Don’t you have a chem test, young lady?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Chemistry? Please. Name one time you ever
used chemistry in your life.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I use chemistry every day.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re a doctor, Mom. I’m not going to be a
doctor. I can’t even say the word ‘orifice,’ let alone put a finger up
one.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>int. drew’s room - morning</strong>: Drew’s room looks like a
four-star hotel suite. Almost trembling with tension, she ENTERS and
immediately sits down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the
present DATE:</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Come on, honey! Let’s tear up Manhattan!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You’re smart. You’re resourceful. You’ll find
a way to make it work.</p>
<p><strong>int. quinn’s saab - continuous action</strong>: RING! Quinn’s
CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed, checks the incoming number.
Drew closes her eyes and prays.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Doctor MacLeod… I’m sorry, but my itinerary
is booked solid today. Call Dr. Wessels. He’s covering for me. He did?
Are you sure it’s the baby’s head? All right. I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I’m sorry, hon. It’s a Blue Light special in
Maternity. Every bed’s full and some poor woman is about to give birth
in the gift shop. I have to go in.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Ah, darn it, Mom. That’s a shame. It’s like
fate is conspiring against us.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You absolutely, positively have to promise me
we’ll do it another time.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I promise. I better hurry. Have Parker drop
you at the train station on her way to school, will you?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Kill ’em in that interview.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Mom, you know, I might not get in.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Are you kidding me? You’re Drew MacLeod.
Nobody’s smarter, nobody works harder and nobody, and I mean nobody, is
ever more prepared.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Hey! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>ext. philadelphia train station - morning</strong>: Commuters
all jump from their cars and into the station.</p>
<p><strong>int. the girls’ honda - morning</strong>: Parker pulls up to
the curb at the station. Drew collects her bag.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Good luck with your interview.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You know, Parker. Chemistry is important. When
you think about it, everything’s made of chemicals.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, I’m interested in chemistry. Just not
the kind with all the numbers and stinky test tubes.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Ah, chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>int. first train car - morning</strong>: Drew finds a seat.
She neatly folds her jacket and sets it next to her. She pulls out a
lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind her – just right. Next, she
takes out a tiny inflatable lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her
lap. A pen goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos. After
laying out her interview materials, she turns to her reflection in the
window.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Professor Spaulding. Good afternoon. I’m Drew
MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Looking for a seat.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: This can’t be happening. Wait, I know. This is
one of those Ground Hog Day dreams, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Ow! I’m awake now. You’re supposed to
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You know, I just got this itch.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Then scratch it and get back to school.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I couldn’t concentrate anyway. I’m too…
distracted today.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You’re permanently distracted. It’s called
Attention Deficit Disorder. Is this about that chat room guy? It is,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No! It’s about spontaneity, which you
obviously wouldn’t know anything about.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I swear to God, Parker, you go through
boyfriends like Junior Mints. It’s pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Pathetic? You want to talk about pathetic?!
At least I don’t count getting accidentally felt up in dodge ball as my
first date!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re going to be eighteen and you’ve never
even HAD a boyfriend!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Is this any of your business?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: This is ridiculous. I don’t have time for this
today. Fine. Don’t graduate from high school. Make a mess of your life
over some complete stranger. I don’t care. But leave me out. I have
something important I need to accomplish today, so please go away.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Would you like this seat so you two can
fight?</p>
<p><strong>drew/parker</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I have to mentally preview my day now. I can’t
talk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Uh, Drew? Do you have any money? I don’t
have enough for a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Please. Like you never ditched school.</p>
<p><strong>int. second train car - morning</strong>: Parker’s got her
headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle Cracker’s “Follow Me,” torturing
everyone in her car.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: ‘You don’t know how you met me…’</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>int. the train - women’s room - continuous action</strong>:
Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if the coast is
clear. Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes, closes
the door and THERE’S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Ticket, please.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Why don’t I save the b.s. story and just ask
you to cut me a break this one time because I know you’ve got a big
heart and you remember what it was like when you were young and… and… …
randy?</p>
<p><strong>ext. trenton station platform - morning</strong>: Parker’s on
the platform. The Conductor climbs back on the train into the FIRST
CAR.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I guess you were never young and randy!</p>
<p><strong>int. first train car - morning</strong>: The Conductor heads
up the aisle – does a double-take when he sees Drew.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: I tried to be nice about it, but if you
want the police involved, this is the way to do it.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Police? I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: No ticket, no train ride.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No! That’s not me! That was my twin sister you
threw off!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Young lady, in thirty years I have heard
every possible line but that’s the lamest ever.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: She’s right there!</p>
<p><strong>angle on the platform</strong>: No Parker. He hauls Drew down
the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR,</p>
<p><strong>she bumps head-on into bike
messenger/pre-med/mountain</strong>: CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY – they
really do CRACK FOREHEADS,</p>
<p><strong>in time with dream guy?</strong>: BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE
WOOZIES. He smiles:</p>
<p><strong>dream guy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m… ouch.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: She’s fine, considering she should be in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: This can’t be happening! I have a… a… little
paper thingy. What are they called? Ticket! I have a ticket! It’s
right…</p>
<p><strong>aarrggh! parrr… kerrr!</strong>: Parker steps up from behind
her.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You get kicked off, too? Why didn’t you just
buy a ticket?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What happened to your head?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh, just a minor concussion I sustained while
the Conductor was throwing me off the train because he thought I was you
sneaking back on the train!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I am! Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: To see when the next train leaves.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I already –</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: – did. They said something about a
delay.</p>
<p><strong>int. trenton train station - continuous action</strong>:
Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS. Drew’s standing in a long line at the
ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold shoulder on… … Parker, who
walks right through to the street side.</p>
<p><strong>action</strong>: Parker steps outside where it’s just as
crowded. She scopes the situation, which isn’t good – stranded COMMUTERS
jostle for the few remaining TAXIS. TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving
match. To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS – standard car
service rigs – sit IDLING, each with a DRIVER next to it, holding up his
sign with his client’s name scratched on it. An EXECUTIVE passes her,
finger in the air, signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that
read: “Wilcox.”</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>int. trenton train station</strong>: Drew has reached the
counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK who wishes he’d paid attention in
school is tired of angry commuters.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: That can’t be. I have to be there before
two!</p>
<p><strong>train clerk</strong>: Well, maybe if you flap your arms real
fast you can fly there, because you won’t get there on a train.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Parker arrives in the nick of time,
pulling her by the arm.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Come on. Hurry. I got us a ride.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Let go of my arm.</p>
<p><strong>ext. trenton train station - continuous action</strong>:
Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: A car service.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Car service? You couldn’t have called for
a…</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Morning, miss.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Good morning. Thank you. My sister’s coming,
too.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You want to make that interview, or not?</p>
<p><strong>int. town car - morning</strong>: Parker tries to play cool –
Drew’s rigid – angry and afraid. Bennie checks his invoice.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: So you’re headed to the Teamster’s Hall on
Second Street?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You know, Mister…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: … Loyola.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Bennie.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Mr. Bennie? We have a slight change of
itinerary. We need to go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: It’s pre-paid. No skin off my nose.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Pre-paid? What’s 57th and 5th?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Barneys.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Not Barneys.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’ve got five hours. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: This was supposed to be someone else’s car,
wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: ‘Scarpelli’? We’re supposed to be Italian?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Northern Italian.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: This is so… wrong.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What? You need to get to that interview. We
now have a ride. We will pay for the ride. End of big deal.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Yeah? No. The city. What’a you talkin’
about?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: I already got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: They’re right here in the car. ’Scuse
me.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Don’t you think that’s a little severe? I
mean, they didn’t see nothin’ yet. They can’t hear nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: You’re the boss. Take it easy. I’ll fix it.
No, I don’t have a shovel. Not today. It’ll be a big mess. Besides, I
just had this suit cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: I’ll take ’em to the wharf, what difference
does it make?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Parker, I think maybe we should get out.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I agree. How about… NOW!</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: Hey?! Where you goin’?!</p>
<p><strong>ext. jersey sidewalk - morning</strong>: They hit the
sidewalk and without breaking stride, race around the first corner,
looking back over their shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: He’s stuck at the light!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: He has no respect for traffic laws!</p>
<p><strong>int. mini-mart - morning</strong>: … where they crouch down
the magazine rack. Among the magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a
Chinese Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: “EMPEROR</p>
<p><strong>defends crown.”</strong>: Parker peers over the top and out
the window. PARKER’S POV – slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street,
Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Is he gone? I can’t believe this. What did you
get us into?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We lost him. Wow. That was a rush.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: A rush? Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: Hey. Give me a quarter, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>mini-mart clerk</strong>: Get outta here, Uncle Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I don’t have any change, but here.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Parker, you’re only feeding the poor man’s
disease. Buy him a healthy snack.</p>
<p><strong>faced, drenching her.</strong>: The Homeless Guy snags the
dollar.</p>
<p><strong>homeless guy</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Ew. That stinks. That’s not just
Slushee.</p>
<p><strong>mini-mart clerk</strong>: It’s Mad Dog. Look at that mess.
It’s gonna smell up the store all day.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: May we use your bathroom please?</p>
<p><strong>mini-mart clerk</strong>: Gas station at the end of the
block. Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>int. burt’s pump ‘n’ go - morning</strong>: BURT, who has no
teeth, hands over the restroom key to the girls. The key is attached to
a full-sized STEERING WHEEL. Burt SNIFFS, wrinkling his nose.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You know, it’s not my place to say, but you
young girls got your whole lives ahead of you. You shouldn’t be drinkin’
at this hour of the day.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s what I keep telling her.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: ’Round the side.</p>
<p><strong>ext. burt’s pump ‘n’ go - morning</strong>: The girls
practically have to drag the key around to the restroom on the side.
Parker puts the key in and slowly… slowly… CREAKING… opens the GATES OF
HELL</p>
<p><strong>int. bus - morning</strong>: Sitting side by side. A YOUNG
MOTHER sits in front of them with her NINE-MONTH-OLD BABY who’s standing
on the seat facing the girls. Drew’s BUMP on her forehead is large and
inflamed, her hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number
four and glucose. She is in a REALLY BAD MOOD, only staring straight
ahead. Parker’s playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to lighten
up her sister’s mood.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Everything’s going to be fine.
Peek-a-boo!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’re practically there. We’ll get you
cleaned up, you’ll get into the program and… Peek-a-boo! … we’ll both
look back on this and laugh our butts off.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I will never, ever, forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. times square - morning</strong>: The bus pulls over then
pulls away, leaving the girls on the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: See? New York. We made it.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I could be arrested for vagrancy looking like
this.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Listen. I’ve got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No. No ideas. I’m going straight to that
interview and wait, without moving or speaking, especially to you, for
four hours.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Come on! We’re going to the Plaza! We can be
Eloise! We’ll get a nice room, you can take a shower and I’ll swap
clothes with you! Simple as that!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Do you have the slightest clue what that would
cost?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: So? You’ve got the emergency credit card Mom
gave you, right?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh. My. God.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Where’s your, uh, stuff?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I left it in his car.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: He knows where I live. He’s going to hunt me
down and kill me.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Come on, Drew. I don’t think even the Mafia
kills people just for scamming a ride. Quit being paranoid. So, we don’t
do the Plaza. I’ve got…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Six dollars and thirty-two cents.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: That won’t get me hosed down at a car
wash.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What are we thinking? You’ve got your
secret-safety twenty!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: My secret-safety twenty. Of course. But it’s
only for emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Parker looks her sister right in the
eye.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Hey, how’d you know about my secret-safety
twenty?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s not important now. But let’s just say
that it’s a good thing for you I think those shoes are so ugly I never
borrowed them. Hey, how about there?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No. I want to get clean, not contract
hepatitis.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We touch nothing.</p>
<p><strong>int. the ritzy plaza</strong>: This looks like a good place
to get your throat cut fighting over a dime’s worth of crack. There’s no
real lobby, just a small area to stand at the “desk” which is behind
iron bars. Behind the iron bars a rabbit-eared TV with a busted-in tube
houses a dead houseplant. An old easy chair leaks stuffing.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hello? Anybody?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Above, a BABY SCREECHES. Something
BREAKS. Then a DISEMBODIED VOICE SPEAKS to them.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Keep your pants on. What’dya want?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I don’t got all day.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We need a room… with a shower. Just for an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Sixty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: You want the room or not?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Sixty dollars an hour for this –</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: – really nice place. How much for half an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Maybe if you two were in school you
could figure out that half a sixty is thirty.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’ve only got twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: You think because I’m short you can just
charm me into making some deal, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It’s all we have. Twenty-six dollars and
thirty-six cents.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Are you the one that stinks so bad?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I had a little accident, okay?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: All right, all right, don’t get your
underwear in a bunch. As a public service, just ’cause you stink so bad,
you can have it for twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Ten-dollar deposit on key.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What part of ‘That is all the money we have’
didn’t make sense to you?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sir, that’s every last cent we have in the
world. I swear to you, we aren’t planning to steal your key.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I give you some special deal, the next
thing you know, you two are telling everybody, hey, this midget was a
real sap. We gave him some sob story and the little guy just busted up
into crocodile tears and handed over the key.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I promise we won’t tell anyone. Will we,
Drew?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Not a word. Girl Scout’s honor.</p>
<p><strong>ahhhhhh!!!!</strong>: Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out
the door.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Drew?! DREW?!</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Come back with my key!</p>
<p><strong>ext. street outside hotel - day</strong>: Panicked, Drew
sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and the Desk Clerk in tow. Laying
the hammer down, the Desk Clerk blasts past Parker – he’s a midget, but
he’s got wheels.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Drew! STOP!</p>
<p><strong>int. maternity ward - morning</strong>: A WOMAN is giving
birth. Her husband holds her hand. Quinn and a nurse are at her
feet.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Mrs. Greenspan? You’re going to have to help.
I need you to push.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. greenspan</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. greenspan</strong>: Honey? The baby? Please?</p>
<p><strong>ext. “today show” sidewalk - morning</strong>: “TODAY SHOW”
SECURITY GUARDS and NYPD descend on the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>nypd officer</strong>: All right. Who’s the wise guy?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Man, that little guy could really motor.
Why’d you bolt?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: There was a rat, Parker. A rat the size of a
Doberman eating my foot.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That was all our money.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Our money? OUR MONEY?!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Key down, you’re going to have an
attack.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Drew’s sucking on her inhaler but is so
irate she spits out the words.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Parker, it was not ‘our’ money and this is not
‘our’ day in New York. What it is, is quite possibly the most important
day of my life. I’ve resigned myself to the fact that you don’t give a
crap about what you do with yours, but if you could find it in your
heart, your tiny, cold steel heart, to respect what this means to me, I
would appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You’re not even listening. That’s typical.
Look, we’re splitting up. Give me back my secret safety money.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You know how I told you not to be
paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Paranoid?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What I meant was, it isn’t paranoia if
someone really is chasing you.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What’s wrong with your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Drew finally turns and she, too,
freezes.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Quiet. Don’t run. He’ll see us.</p>
<p><strong>he saw us!</strong>: The girls break into a run.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: How’d he find us?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Maybe it’s just coincidence!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE</p>
<p><strong>going!!</strong>: She points up at the street sign – 57th and
5th. Oops.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Jump!</p>
<p><strong>int. the plaza - girls’ pov - day</strong>: IN THE STREET,
Bennie’s getting up, brushing the crap off. When a CAB HONKS at him, he
gives it an Italian salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the
curb it’s clear: He’s lost the girls.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I don’t want to do this anymore. I want to be
done. No more rats, no more mob hit men.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Well, Cinderella, your wish has come true.
Voila, La Plaza, mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: So? Hello? No dinero?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yeah. I’ve got what I’d like to call a
‘creative solution’ to that.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No. I’m calling Mom.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What good will that do?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ll have her… uh…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Have her what? Hi, Mom? Could you leave that
baby halfway outta there and drive into the city?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Dad, then.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Dad, hey. Drew. Complete loser. Couldn’t get
to an interview by myself, need full bail out. Yeah. I’m the one who was
going to change the world, I just couldn’t get across town.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is shot to hell!
Blue, red –</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I don’t even know what that means! I’m running
out of time. Is that guy looking at me?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Don’t look.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: When you ask a question like that, the
person is going to look.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I think he was.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Drew, we haven’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yeah, but I’m standing in the lobby of the
Plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any
moment. In fact, I might attack at any moment.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - the plaza - day</strong>: The girls climb out
of the elevator and sneak to the end of the hall where Parker stops and
peers back around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What are we doing? And why am I
whispering?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’re getting you a shower. Blake Greer
pulled this at the Sheraton after the prom.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Great. Now we’re emulating Blake Greer, voted
most likely to commit a felony before having to shave.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’re not going to steal anything. We’re
just going to sneak in, use a little soap and water and get out.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh, we’re not going to steal anything. Super.
Just a little ‘breaking and entering.’</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’re not going to break anything. We are
going to enter, however.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No. No. No.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Shhh… here comes somebody.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: REVEALS – at the opposite end of the
hallway, Parker and Drew aren’t the only ones watching. A PAINTER with
one lazy eye, ROGER, pauses with his roller and carefully peeks around
the corner.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: It’s the New York Kennel Club,
Emile, not the New York Knickerbockers. Please call the caterer and
cancel the beer.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The ELEVATOR OPENS for them and they
step in. Parker RUNS LIKE HELL for the door of their suite… it’s just
about to close when she SLIDES LIKE PETE ROSE INTO FIRST, just getting a
hand on it. She lies there on the floor, holding the door and WHISPERS
LOUDLY to Drew.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I didn’t want to have to do this, but… look
in the mirror behind you.</p>
<p><strong>int. lo bianchos’ suite - day</strong>: Practically sewn to
Parker, Drew follows her into the suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Housekeeping?</p>
<p><strong>int. the plaza - hallway</strong>: At the end of the hallway,
the PAINTER watches the suite door close. Hm. What are those girls
doing?</p>
<p><strong>int. lo bianchos’ suite</strong>: It’s lavish, yaddada
yaddada.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Drew, you’re not a criminal. You just smell
like one. This way.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Parker leads her to the big double doors
of the master bedroom and slowly OPENS them. There, on the bed, is THE
EMPEROR, defending champion of the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A
CHINESE CRESTED HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he
may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply eyes them. He
might even be smiling.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh, no. Oh my god. A… a… What the hell is
it?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: A dog?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m itching already. See? Are my arms red?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Key down. I’ll take him in the living room
and keep a lookout. You just get in that shower.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hi, little guy. You don’t look so tough,
huh? You don’t look much like a dog, actually. More like Woody
Woodpecker.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re cute, aren’t you, in a freakazoidal
kinda way.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Was your daddy a rat? Is that it? Well, I
still like you.</p>
<p><strong>parker’s pov</strong>: The hallway’s empty. But The Emperor,
feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into the hallway, then turns TO face
her. Come on. Let’s play!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Come back here, little ratdog. Come to Mommy
Parker.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - the plaza</strong>: But sure enough, just as
she gets close, he turns and dashes down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Bad ratdog!</p>
<p><strong>covered.</strong>: Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker
looks up to see the Painter with the now-mauve Emperor in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Wow. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Thank you. Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s not your dog! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>angle on the elevators around the corner</strong>: as they
open and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY steps out, looking both ways and
spotting one thing awry… … a shoe holding open the door to the Lo
Bianchos’ suite.</p>
<p><strong>int. lo bianchos’ suite - master bath - day</strong>: Drew
finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky clothes and gets ONE
FOOT IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE HEARS:</p>
<p><strong>house security guy</strong>: Hello? Mrs. Lo Biancho? House
security!</p>
<p><strong>poor naked drew freezes. the world stops spinning on
its</strong>: AXIS. Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling it
off its hanger and covering herself.</p>
<p><strong>int. lo bianchos’ suite - living room - day</strong>: The
SECURITY GUY snoops toward the bedroom doors. Just as he reaches for the
handle, the door swings open, SHADOCK, clocking him and dropping him.
Wrapped in the shower curtain, Drew races across the living room. Just
as she reaches the hallway, Parker’s there, also at a dead run and they
don’t even break stride.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: There’s a man in there!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Somebody took the dog!</p>
<p><strong>ext. plaza alley fire escape/alley - day</strong>: … and
scurry down the stairs only to find that THE</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Parker hangs and then drops onto the top
of a DUMPSTER with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the
alley.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ll, uh, go around.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you out of your mind?! It’s only a
little ways! JUMP!</p>
<p><strong>int. the plaza - hallway</strong>: Rubbing his sore head,
Morty the Security Guy lumbers down the hallway. BEHIND HIM Mr. and
Mrs. Lo Biancho get out of the elevator:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: When competing in a dog show, best
to bring one’s dog along, yes?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lo biancho</strong>: I thought you had him, dear.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: See? Empty.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Oh, dear God!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ON MORTY – making an abrupt halt. Baby?!
He turns around and lopes back to the suite.</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Mrs. Lo Biancho? I’m Mort Sestero, hotel
security.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Please! Please help!</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Someone took your baby?</p>
<p><strong>mr. lo biancho</strong>: The Emperor is missing.</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: The Emperor is a dog, right?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Not ‘a’ dog, no. THE NEW YORK</p>
<p><strong>aren’t you trying to find him!</strong>: Morty pulls his
RADIO as he backs out the door and heads down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: This is Remote One to base, Remote One to
base. Code 12, I repeat, Code 12.</p>
<p><strong>another security guy</strong>: You goin’ to lunch already,
Morty?</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Code 12 isn’t lunch, Bruce! Didn’t you read
your manual?</p>
<p><strong>another security guy</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>monty</strong>: Call NYPD. We have a dognapping.</p>
<p><strong>another security guy</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Just call the damn police and patch me
through. The Emperor’s been kidnapped.</p>
<p><strong>another security guy</strong>: Holy cripes, why didn’t you
say it was political?!</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Political? THE EMPEROR IS A DOG,</p>
<p><strong>another security guy</strong>: You want me to call NYPD about
a dog?</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: I am going to kill you, then fire you, Bruce.
Got it? Kill, fire. That order.</p>
<p><strong>ext. alley behind the plaza - day</strong>: Drew’s still
FROZEN on the fire escape.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Yes you can!</p>
<p><strong>angle on the end of the alley</strong>: where Roger appears
with The Emperor. Surprised to see the girls, he backpedals, worried
he’ll be seen, but they’re too wrapped up in their own getaway and he
quietly makes his way to his VAN sides: “Michelangelo’s Painting: A
Masterpiece every time”.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Have fun in prison. Under ‘Summer
Internships’ on your college application, you can write ‘license plate
manufacturing.’</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Roger’s VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing
Parker’s attention. She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears
around the corner into traffic. Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the
closed lid of the dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I did it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Give me… my… curtain.</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Stop! Bring back that dog!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: He thinks we have the dog!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: A painter took it!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: A pain –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It’s DREAM GUY from the train and for a
confused BEAT they look into each other’s familiar faces where we read
recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:</p>
<p><strong>dream guy</strong>: You know, one of us is gonna get hurt if
we keep doing this.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hey, complete stranger! Get off my
sister!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m, uh, late for this place, thing, where I’m
supposed to be. College. Interview!</p>
<p><strong>dream guy</strong>: Where at?</p>
<p><strong>nyu!</strong>: … before disappearing into the CROWD on the
sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>dream guy</strong>: Me, too!</p>
<p><strong>ext. sidewalk in front of plaza - day</strong>: The girls
weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP CAR SCREECHING to a halt in
front of them and quickly take a left into…</p>
<p><strong>ext. the other alley adjacent the plaza - day</strong>: Where
to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door – locked – the next door
SWINGS OPEN as if by divine providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step
past them out while the girls step inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. runway show - backstage - day</strong>: Chaos. MODELS,
DRESSERS, SYCOPHANTS, “I ONLY DATE MODELS” GUYS and the famous couture
fashion designer, BOBO, are mid-show and friggin’ frantic.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Where are they?! No more breaks! Do you hear
me! We have a show to do, you nitwits! Models! BAH! You have hollow
gourds for heads! The kind they make those Mexican rattles out of!</p>
<p><strong>showrunner</strong>: Maracas.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Maracas! Maracas that take coffee breaks when
I am paying them a</p>
<p><strong>fortune!</strong>: Bobo spots the girls coming through the
back door and physically grabs them both, pushing them at the
Showrunner.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Hair! Makeup! Daywear! Clubbing! Vite!</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Is that Helmut Lang? Go!</p>
<p><strong>mouths</strong>: HAIR! MAKEUP! CLOTHES! and TEAMS OF DRESSERS
virtually surround them. INSIDE THE MOB OF DRESSERS SURROUNDING DREW the
HAIR STYLIST raises his brush and scissors, but PAUSES. The rest of the
team stops, watching him make his decision. He shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>hairstylist</strong>: Perfection.</p>
<p><strong>dressing team - a moment later</strong>: And the DRESSING
TEAM surrounding Parker parts, revealing her in a very un-Parker-like,
super-chic business suit. She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror
and rolls her eyes. Boring. The DREW TEAM parts and we are stunned to
see they’ve chosen to drape her in a show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW
OUTFIT that is some sort of marriage between dominatrix and nun,
complete with a habit and black leather bikini. ON PARKER who spots Drew
and is, for the first time in the movie, speechless.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Why does this not surprise me?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Excuse me, but I’m supposed to be going to my
college interview.</p>
<p><strong>showrunner</strong>: That’s rich. A model going to college.
What next? Talking monkeys?</p>
<p><strong>int. runway - day</strong>: FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS!
Blinded, Drew stumbles forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the
catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>on the audience – also speechless.</strong>: This is when
Drew catches sight of herself on a TV MONITOR at the end of the
walk.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Her first instinct is to RUN, but
suddenly THE AUDIENCE</p>
<p><strong>bravo!</strong>: Drew recovers herself a bit. Wow. They’re
clapping for me?</p>
<p><strong>int. runway show - backstage</strong>: Parker’s watching
through the curtains when she spots Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES
through the back door. Uh-oh. The Showrunner’s holding her arm, waiting
to throw her onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker takes
the initiative and…</p>
<p><strong>int. runway</strong>: … jumps onstage, vamping it down the
catwalk like she was born to it. Drew’s still at the end of the runway,
basking in the APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in
her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and… … throws a hand
on her hip, thrusts it out – sexy executive! and leans into her
sister:</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: The hotel guy’s here.</p>
<p><strong>brava!</strong>: Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the
curtains, blowing kisses and heading for the girls.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: And the police.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The ADORING CROWD holds them up and they
CROWD SURF toward the rear of the room.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Everybody washed their hands, right?</p>
<p><strong>angle on morty</strong>: Spotting the commotion, he and the
two cops race down the catwalk. Realizing he’ll never get through the
crowd, he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but… THE CROWD
ABRUPTLY PARTS and he does a complete FACE</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: I guess that explains why he’s a security
guard.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the girls</strong>: who bust out the back doors of
the large room and unwittingly…</p>
<p><strong>int. the plaza - lobby - continuous action</strong>: … right
back into The Plaza lobby.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Is this what they call ‘returning to the
scene of the crime’?</p>
<p><strong>plaza manager</strong>: I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Lo
Biancho, The Plaza will do everything in its power to see that The
Emperor is safely returned and that the criminals are brought to
justice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Justice?! I want them executed!
Tortured first, slowly, and then beheaded!</p>
<p><strong>plaza manager</strong>: The Plaza’s policy is of course to
serve you in any capacity we can.</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Bruce! 10-80 at the wagon wheel!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Park…</p>
<p><strong>ext. the plaza - continuous action</strong>: Then, Parker
HEAVES THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT, spinning it so fast the security
guys and cops can’t jump in.</p>
<p><strong>int. lobby of the plaza - continuous action</strong>: The
four men all stand there, watching the spinning door.</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>ext. the plaza - continuous action</strong>: The police and
security look left, right, across the street.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Where’d they go?</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: They couldn’t have gone very far. We’ll split
up. You go that way! You take Fifth! Come on, get on your horse!</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Two black.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: Where do you think those two went?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Beats me. They didn’t have any stupid
dog with them from what I could see.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: Might have stashed it.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Maybe they ate it.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: The rent-a-cop said the mutt’s worth
like 50 G’s. That makes it grand theft, my friend. Five to ten.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the news stand</strong>: where a BLIND CASHIER
smiles at the two policemen.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: Hey, Speedy. You didn’t see a couple of
blondes run past here, did you?</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: Yep. Couldn’t miss ’em. Real criminal types.
Looked like they were headed to Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: That’s where they all go.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched
down behind the counter right next to Speedy.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: See you around.</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: Not if I see you first.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: I say we put Abbott and Costello on the
ransom watch. I don’t want to be stuck in the same room all day with
Leona Helmsley’s nasty stepsister.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns
up his nose and waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: Whew. You know, it’s not some old wives’
tale about blind people having an acute sense of smell.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: So? What did you do with that dog?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We didn’t steal it, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: A painter did.</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: You girls best give yourselves up and tell
’em the story.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: He’s right, Parker.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Of course he’s right. We’re going to march
in there and give ourselves up right this minute. They will, of course,
take us down to the precinct, call Mom and Dad, we’ll give our
statement, they’ll grill us under hot lights for a few hours, force us
to confess with some tricky good cop/bad cop routine and the next thing
you know we’re doing five to ten in Attica.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: So we’ll turn ourselves in right after the
interview.</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: May I make one suggestion?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: Hit the showers before you do anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We’re facing felony charges, Parker. Maybe you
can do your on- line flirting later. Better yet, he can see you during
visitor’s hours.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh my God. Warren works in the city.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Warren? WARREN?! So you lied, right to my
face. No, Drew, this isn’t about the chat room guy. Nah!</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: Take your daughters to work day.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Are you listening to me?! Give me that stupid
thing!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Knock it off, Drew! This guy might be able
to help. He lives here.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Parker, you have completely lost your mind if
you can be thinking about boys at a time like this!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: The United Nations?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You can’t possibly know somebody who works at
the United Nations. Maybe he meant United Sub Sandwiches. Or United
Skate Rats Store.</p>
<p><strong>soon.</strong>: Parker pockets the Blackberry.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: So. We’re going to the United Nations to use
the restroom.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: How convenient. You arrange a little date
while your sister’s future hangs in the balance.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Look, he said he’d help and it’s only a
couple blocks away. You got a better idea?</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: Coast’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Speedy.</p>
<p><strong>speedy</strong>: You’re quite welcome. Good luck in that
interview.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Wal-Mart? Hey, Marvin. You bet. Typing
away.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Today? Gee, I’m on a real roll, Marv. The
juices overfloweth, if you get my meaning. Don’t want to plug the juices
when they’re overflowing, right? How much? Hm. I guess I could carve out
some time.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Charley smells his armpit. Ripe. He’ll
need a quick shower.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Got it. See you in the City.</p>
<p><strong>int. charley’s ’77 ford pickup - day</strong>: Charley’s
driving, eating a sandwich and dialing his CELL PHONE at the same time,
veering dangerously and obliviously across the center stripe. The
oncoming CAR careens out of his way in a blaze of HORN.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Hello, beautiful Doctor Lady. How goes your
day? Right next to the magazine rack? What did they name it, Newsweek?
I’m going into the City to meet some big shot publisher. Maybe I’ll
swing by NYU afterwards and see if I can give Drew a ride home. You talk
to her today? She’s probably having too much fun to call. I’ll ring her
up. Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>int. madison square garden - lo bianchos’ private
box</strong>: Far below, Garden employees set up for the dog show.
Inside, the Lo Bianchos’ luxury box is likewise being prepared. In one
corner, Bruce and Morty are fumbling with the unfamiliar electronic
tracing gear, readying for the ransom call. Mrs. Lo Biancho turns up her
nose at the buffet table.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: What are those?</p>
<p><strong>caterer</strong>: Rumaki, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Rumaki! Yech! You might as well
wrap dog turds in bacon. Take them away.</p>
<p><strong>babs</strong>: Andrea, Andrea. How dreadful! I shudder to
think how the poor Emperor may be suffering.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Dear Babs. I’m at wit’s end.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: You! Tell the thieves I’ll pay
anything they want! Anything!</p>
<p><strong>babs</strong>: Of course. What price on a loved one?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Precisely!</p>
<p><strong>babs</strong>: I’ve got to run. That stupid groomer used a
commercial conditioner on Coco and she looks like trailer trash.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: I’ll give them ten grand, tops, but
only if the dog’s back before show time.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A troubled Bruce isn’t having much luck
operating the trace machine.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Do you know how to turn this on?</p>
<p><strong>ext. sidewalk in new york - day</strong>: The girls try to be
as inconspicuous as possible walking cross-town in couture, Drew with
only one shoe and in a bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We’re going to make it, Drew. You’ll see.
There’s still plenty of time. You’ll get cleaned up, we can trade
clothes… this is a nice suit, huh? Right?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re going to get accepted, then we can
explain the misunderstanding about the dog to the police and everything
will be okay.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Maybe after the police forgive us for sneaking
into someone else’s hotel room, we can ask them to please keep the mob
hit man from whacking us and dropping us into the marina so he doesn’t
get his suit dirty.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: First things first.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Parker, I know you’re trying to cheer me up,
but I have to be honest. This is all your fault.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: My fault? MY FAULT?! I didn’t mean for any
of this to happen!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yeah, right! Like you didn’t mean to ask
Bernie Lipscomb to the prom!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’ll bet that was just another accident of
yours that happened to screw up my life!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Bernie Lipscomb? You…?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You liked Bernie, too?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You know I did!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No I didn’t. I haven’t seen you talk to a
guy since we were in kindergarten and we thought Jerry Wester was a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You asked Bernie just to snake him from
me!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I did not! Wow, the really spooky thing is,
that would mean we liked the same guy.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Directly in front of them, however, a
POLICE CAR is stopped at the light with two uniformed POLICEMEN inside.
The girls spot the Police and stop. The Police look up at the girls
through their windshield.</p>
<p><strong>int. police car - day</strong>: Their on-board FAX is
spitting out an APB PHOTO. The POLICEMAN on the passenger side pulls it
off and holds it up.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Isn’t that those two right there?</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>policeman’s pov</strong>: – the girls are gone. They don’t
take much notice of a HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE passing them with the DRIVER
up front and TWO TOURISTS kissing in the back.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Where the hell did they go?</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: 605 to Base. We spotted the dognapping
suspects, corner of 1st and 49th.</p>
<p><strong>police operator</strong>: Copy that, 605.</p>
<p><strong>int. detectives’ car - day</strong>: Hogan and Williamson are
eating sandwiches but they’ve paused to listen:</p>
<p><strong>police operator</strong>: Car 91, 605 reports suspects
spotted at 1st and 49th.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: 605, do you still have visual?</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: Negative. But they can’t be far.
They’re on foot.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: That’s over by the U.N.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: See if you can pick them up. We’re on our
way.</p>
<p><strong>ext. u.n. plaza - day</strong>: The Horse Carriage passes the
usual groups of PROTESTORS and TOURISTS outside on the U.N. Plaza and… …
the Girls jump off and move into the crowd, headed for the ENTRANCE
where there’s a LINE at the door. DOWN THE BLOCK the Detectives’
unmarked car appears and parks at the curb. Williamson and Hogan climb
out, scanning the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: There they are.</p>
<p><strong>detectives’ pov</strong>: – just a glimpse as they ENTER the
building.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: What in the world could they be doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>int. entrance to u.n. - continuous action</strong>: The Girls
pass through the metal detector and move toward a small group of
TOURISTS waiting by the sign that reads:</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Do you see him?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: I can’t tell you how much I’ve looked
forward to this.</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: Momma?</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Sorry. My mistake.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh, shit. What now?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Warren? Does anyone know Warren Collier?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Tour Guide, WARREN COLLIER, looks
over at them.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Parker?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Gee, Warren. Isn’t that strange? I didn’t
recognize you from your picture.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Yeah, I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We don’t have time for this now.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Do you have an office or someplace private
we could go?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I just have to do this tour and…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: We’ll get back to that.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Okay. Let me get somebody to cover for
me.</p>
<p><strong>int. tour guide office - continuous action - day</strong>: …
where another TOUR GUIDE is taking a break.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Hey, Angie, take the 11:00 for me, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: No way. Judge Judy’s on.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Angie? Take the 11:00.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: You owe me, Warren.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Are you a lying sack, or what?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What was I supposed to do? I liked you. If
I’d sent a real picture, would you have met me?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: That means no. At least this way I got to
see you before you blow me off.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No one is blowing you off, Warren. As a matter
of fact, we’re very happy to see you, aren’t we, Parker?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: And we’re grateful for your help.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: This is my sister, Drew.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Not-a-twin, huh?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: That’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Yeah, well. I guess everybody would like the
world to see them a little bit differently than they are.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Super. Now that that’s all settled, is there a
restroom I can get to without going out there?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What’s wrong with going out there?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Police, for one thing.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Police? I thought you guys were joking.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It’s the kind of joke that will be a lot
funnier a few years from now.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Well that door’s the only way out. There’s a
restroom at the end of the main hall.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: They there?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I don’t see ’em.</p>
<p><strong>angle on williamson and hogan</strong>: who Parker can’t see
because her line of sight is blocked by the office door.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: They must be searching the building.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What’d you guys do, anyway? Mug a couple
supermodels?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>int. u.n. lobby - continuous action - day</strong>: The three
make their way across the vast lobby, but before they reach the main
hall…</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: Hey! You two! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>int. u.n. - women’s room - continuous action</strong>: She
hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and puts her feet up.
She tries to catch her breath. GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next
to her. Somebody’s in BAD SHAPE. Another HEART-RENDING GROAN can’t be
ignored.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative</strong>: Ohhh… I’m so sick. The
mussels at lunch. You have to help me.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m kind of in my own private hell right
now.</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Drew.</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative</strong>: Drew… it’s vitally
important.</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative</strong>: Please. You have to take
this to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Uh, Canada? It’s sort of far away.</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative</strong>: In the Assembly. Give the
file to Mr. Wakefield, the Canadian representative.</p>
<p>****: Please. I can’t… get up.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You want me to take this to the Canadian
Representative to the United Nations?</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative</strong>: Hurry! This is a
crisis!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Where’s the Assembly?</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative</strong>: To the left. Run!</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway outside mailroom</strong>: On the run, Warren
and Parker ditch through a door marked MAILROOM. A BEAT LATER, Hogan
appears from around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>int. mailroom - continuous action</strong>: Vacant and quiet.
The DOOR OPENS SLOWLY and Hogan ENTERS. It’s a small room with a few
canvas mail sacks piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies.
An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty</p>
<p><strong>assembly room.</strong>: Nothing here, Hogan closes the door.
IN A BEAT, one of the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head
up.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: You have nice breath.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Thank you. Maybe we should get out of this
sack.</p>
<p><strong>int. u.n. assembly - day</strong>: Drew peeks in through the
door, reading the COUNTRY IDENTIFICATIONS on the desks… Bangkok, Borneo,
Bulgaria… Canada. The REPRESENTATIVES are in the middle of a heated
DEBATE that we hear being translated .</p>
<p><strong>chinese rep</strong>: Impossible! This would be globally
destabilizing!</p>
<p><strong>bulgarian rep</strong>: Hah! Posturing and rhetoric!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE is sitting
gingerly in his chair, shifting uncomfortably. He looks pale, shaky.
Drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his desk with the
file.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>canadian representative #2</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh, no. You didn’t have the mussels at lunch,
too, did you?</p>
<p><strong>doorway.</strong>: Drew sees them. Uh, oh. The only thing she
can do to make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian Rep’s
chair and turn her back on them like she’s one of the Assembly members.
She sits up, shuffles the files around. Glancing furtively to either
side, she sees that everyone else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE.
She puts one on.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the detective</strong>: Williamson’s gaze comes to
rest on… … THE BACK OF DREW’S HEAD. Hm. That looks familiar. This is
when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points an accusatory finger at
Drew!</p>
<p><strong>chinese rep</strong>: This crisis falls at the feet of one
nation and one nation only!</p>
<p><strong>chinese rep</strong>: How do you defend such a position! The
world is waiting to hear!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Well, I’m not certain…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: … that I NEED to defend our position!</p>
<p><strong>north korea</strong>: Is she new?</p>
<p><strong>norway</strong>: Beats me.</p>
<p><strong>north korea</strong>: She’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>norway</strong>: Weird hairdo.</p>
<p><strong>chinese rep</strong>: That is absurd!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Absurd?!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Not so absurd, since I have the documents
right here in my possession!</p>
<p><strong>int. u.n. - mailroom</strong>: Parker’s peeking through the
door, checking the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How are we going to find Drew?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Something tells me that won’t be too
tough.</p>
<p><strong>int. u.n. assembly - day</strong>: Drew glances Williamson
EXITING.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: And besides, who said absurd is necessarily
bad? Sometimes absurd is good! For instance, absurd can be sort of…
funny! In conclusion, I propose that all of you should talk amongst
yourselves. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kofi anan</strong>: Canada has proposed further debate.</p>
<p><strong>u.s. rep</strong>: The United States of America seconds the
motion!</p>
<p><strong>int. lobby of the u.n. assembly - continuous action</strong>:
Drew busts through the doors just as Warren and Parker come running with
the Detectives chasing them. The three of them make for the front door
but a TOUR GROUP comprised of a hundred young JAPANESE GIRLS blocks
their EXIT. Warren thinks fast and YELLS IN JAPANESE.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT!</p>
<p><strong>ext. u.n. plaza - day</strong>: Once outside, he YELLS
AGAIN.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You speak Japanese?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I may not look like an underwear model, but
I’m smarter than a hundred of them put together.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We don’t have any money!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I’m smart AND rich!</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi - continuous action</strong>: They jump into the
back seat, Warren in the middle. Parker leans urgently into the
DRIVER:</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Follow that… uh…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: They’re following US, Parker!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, yeah. JUST GO!</p>
<p><strong>int. detective’s car - continuous action</strong>: Williamson
FIRES UP the CRUISER.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Maybe we should give them a little leash
and see what they do with it.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: Fine. But we’re gonna have to stop for lunch
pretty soon, ’cause I’m getting heartburn.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi - continuous action</strong>: Parker leans across
Warren to Drew.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Excuse me, what were you doing?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Someone was sick in the bathroom and they
asked me to – hold on, I don’t owe you any explanation.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re the one all ‘I gotta get to this
interview or I’m gonna have a nervous breakdown’ and yet you have time
to address the United Nations?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: You know, technically, you have to have
security clearance to enter the Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Not now, Warren.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You have a lot of nerve, Parker. It was you
that got me tossed off the train! You had to give the bum that dollar!
You get the suit, I get the leather bikini!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Which isn’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: And you got Bernie Lipscomb while I got
Scrabble with Mom and Dad!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Who’s Bernie Lipscomb?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I told you, I didn’t know you liked him! It
was no big deal!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It was to me!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How could I know? You never tell me
anything!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: There’s a good reason for that!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You know very well what it means, Ms. Big
Mouth!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Big mouth?! Ooh, I hope you miss that stupid
interview!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh yeah? Well, the joke’s on you, because
there isn’t any interview!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No interview. I screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You screwed up what?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Scheduling the interview. You deaf?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re Drew. Drew doesn’t screw ANYTHING up,
let alone scheduling. You’re the Iron Chef of scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I missed the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: After they made the first cut from the
preliminary application, we were supposed to send in a form to secure
our interview time and I filled it out and had everything ready to go in
the mailbox and then…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: And then what? Earthquake? Tsunami? Nuclear
winter?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Forgot?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yes. I just forgot. When I found it in my bag
a week later, I’d missed the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: So today? All this? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I… I was going to try to meet Professor
Spaulding and…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You were just going to jump him?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Sort of a guerilla interview? You know, I’m
a big Michael Moore fan…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I called and the secretary said there were no
exceptions to the deadline so I was going to try to see him when he
finished the other interviews. I knew it was hopeless, but… I was so…
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh, to hell with it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Drew?! Drew, get back in this taxi!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: She’s pretty upset.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Gee, you really are a genius.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Talk about spontaneous.</p>
<p><strong>ext. block north of the garden - continuous action</strong>:
Tears running, Drew’s walking too quickly for the one stupid shoe. She
nearly turns her ankle.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Darn it! DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: That’s… that’s the painter.</p>
<p><strong>int. detective’s car - same time</strong>: Williamson and
Hogan have the same problem with the traffic and can’t see clearly
what’s going on up ahead.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Did one of them just get out?</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: I think so. Maybe she’s going for the
dog.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Maybe that’s what they want us to
think.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: So we stay with the taxi?</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: Unless you want to hoof it after the
other one.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: We stay with the taxi.</p>
<p><strong>int. roger’s van - continuous action</strong>: Roger dials a
cell phone while The Emperor stands on the passenger seat with his front
paws on the dash. As far as we can tell, he’s having a great time being
kidnapped and doesn’t mind being mauve.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Get in the back, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Stupid dog.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>continuous action</strong>: Mrs. Lo Biancho calmly answers
her cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: If you want to see your dog alive again,
listen closely. I want a hundred thousand dollars transferred into this
numbered Swiss account –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: – I’ll give you ten grand but only
if he’s in Madison Square Garden in…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: One hour. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: You have one minute to decide.</p>
<p><strong>int. roger’s van - continuous action</strong>: Roger looks at
the phone. It wasn’t supposed to go like that. He looks at The
Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Well, Mr. Fancy Pants. You can wipe that
stupid smile off your face. I don’t think they love you as much as you
think they do.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi - continuous action</strong>: Parker and Warren are
scanning the sidewalk ahead for Drew.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Where’d she go?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I think she took a right up there.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Follow my sister.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: I thought we were the ones being
followed.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Stay flexible, will you please?</p>
<p><strong>int. roger’s van</strong>: He hits redial. Mrs. Lo Biancho
answers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Yesss?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Okay. Here’s how we make the –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: – First of all, you forgot to
disguise your voice.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Secondly, my husband will meet you
in ten minutes on the corner of 43rd and Broadway. He’ll have the money.
Bring the dog.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: But that’s ridiculous! You’ll just bring the
police! No way! Consider him Kung Pau!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Don’t hang up!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: The police, it appears, have other
priorities, like humans or something. And I assure you, the Hotel
Security… people… will not interfere. In any case, little man, we just
want the dog back before showtime, do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Ciao.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: No wonder you look so happy. As far as you’re
concerned, you’ve escaped from the Wicked Witch of the West.</p>
<p><strong>ext. block north of the garden</strong>: Drew watches as
Roger climbs out, looks up and down the street, then moves around to the
passenger side, grabs The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag. AT THE
END OF THE BLOCK – SPECTATORS for the New York Kennel Club Dog Show have
begun filing into the Garden. Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under
one arm. The Emperor pokes his nose out. Roger pushes it back in. The
dog pokes it back out.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Hey! Give me that dog!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I just want you to know that I’m allergic to
you AND cynophobic!</p>
<p><strong>mr. lo biancho</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I can’t stop! I have to return this dog!</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: I’ll be right back!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Uh, isn’t that your sister?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: It can’t be. She’s terrified of dogs.</p>
<p><strong>int. detective’s car - day</strong>: They round the corner
behind Parker and Warren.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: I’m telling you, I got a hunch these girls
don’t have anything to do with this dog.</p>
<p><strong>int. bennie’s town car - day</strong>: Just as he turns the
corner, the PARADE PASSES HIM. What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>ext. block north of the garden - continuous action</strong>:
The Emperor’s having the time of his life. He licks Drew’s face joyfully
as she weaves through the growing crowd.</p>
<p><strong>drew’s dog-slobbered pov</strong>: REVEALS A UNIFORMED
POLICEMAN doing security at the DELIVERY ENTRANCE to the Garden, where
SHOW PARTICIPANTS, wheeling their DOG KENNELS, are being checked in by
two</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Drew draws a bead on THE POLICEMAN,
determined to reach him and hand over The Emperor:</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Officer?! Officer?!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Officer?!</p>
<p><strong>show official #1</strong>: Miss! You can’t go in without
credentials!</p>
<p><strong>continuous action</strong>: Drew has entered HER OWN PERSONAL
CIRCLE OF HELL – DOGS</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Where’s the Policeman?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CLOSE ON THE HOUND DOG – lifting his big
nose in the air, he sniffs mightily and then… BAYING LIKE HE’S COON
HUNTING UNDER A KENTUCKY MOON, the Hound Dog leaps off his table, heads
after Drew.</p>
<p><strong>chaos.</strong>: The TWO SHOW OFFICIALS, sporting nifty
sweaters and manicures, are prepared to sacrifice their lives to block
the door. In addition to the PARTICIPANTS trying to get inside, they’re
holding off Roger, Mr. Lo Biancho, Williamson and Hogan.</p>
<p><strong>show official #1</strong>: No entry without official
credentials!</p>
<p><strong>mr. lo biancho</strong>: I’m Emile Lo Biancho! I demand to be
let in!</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: NYPD! Move aside!</p>
<p><strong>show official #1</strong>: I’ll have to see identification,
officers. I’m so sorry, Mr. Lo Biancho. Go right in.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: You think she made it?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: She’s faster than she looks.</p>
<p><strong>int. madison square garden - continuous action</strong>: She
is – but now she’s not running to catch a policeman, but to try to keep
from being over-taken by…</p>
<p><strong>int. madison square garden - lo bianchos’ box</strong>: The
ROAR of the CROWD and the BARKING of the PACK draw the attention of
everyone in the Lo Bianchos’ box.</p>
<p><strong>morty</strong>: Isn’t that The Emperor, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Good God. He’s mauve.</p>
<p><strong>int. madison square garden</strong>: Drew makes it across the
floor and out the other side into a tunnel…</p>
<p><strong>int. madison square garden - concession area</strong>: …
appearing in the concession area.</p>
<p><strong>angle on a shih-tzu</strong>: as it breaks off, jumps onto a
concession stand and begins looting it. Drew makes for the EXIT past the
TICKET TAKERS who leap out of the way and just as she reaches the door
and pushes it open…</p>
<p><strong>mountain of dogs!</strong>: Williamson, Hogan, Morty, Bruce,
Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho and quite a few SPECTATORS pour out the
doors.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Please! I’ll get hives! Oh, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>drew’s pov</strong>: The Detectives appear above her.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: She holds up The Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I, uh, just wanted to return him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: Flog her! Step aside and I’ll whip
her myself!</p>
<p><strong>mr. lo biancho</strong>: Didn’t you say it was a man who
called, Dear?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lo biancho</strong>: So she had an accomplice! We’ll
beat the information out of the little wench! Get him cleaned up,
Emile.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I didn’t take her dog, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>williamson</strong>: We’ll sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: But I have this interview. I mean, it’s not
really an interview. I’d never lie to the police… … never mind.</p>
<p><strong>down the street</strong>: Parker and Warren round the corner
at a run, only in time to watch the Detective’s car leave with Drew in
the back window.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We have to go to the jail and tell them what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: What on earth did happen?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Poor Drew. She wanted to get into that
program more than anything in the world.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: You goin’ somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Hello, sir.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh my God! Please don’t kill me!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Kill?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We don’t know anything at all! We didn’t see
anything or hear anything and I’ll swear to that in a court of law!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Just not in the face.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: What’s the big idea? You two a couple a
nutbags or somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Nut bags? No. I mean, yes. Is there a right
answer to that? See, my sister had this interview which turned out not
to be an interview, really and I sort of messed things up because I
wanted to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Really? You came into town just for me?
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Not now, Warren. Drew was going to be late
even though technically she wasn’t going to be late since there wasn’t
an interview and that’s when we got in your car. I promise we meant to
pay. It was a true emergency.</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: I meant, why you runnin’ when I’m trying to
give you your bag back?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You were just…?</p>
<p><strong>bennie</strong>: I found your mom’s number in the book. She
said you needed it pretty badly for that big interview. Listen, I gotta
go. It’s my mother-in-law’s birthday and I gotta plant some stupid rose
bush and then take her out to dinner at the Pier. See ya around.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Thank you?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Well, he certainly is a good Samaritan.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: You guys lead a pretty interesting life,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: We going to the jail, or what? I’ve never
been to a jail before.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>int. jail booking room - day</strong>: FLASH! A MUGS HOT is
taken of Drew, looking as bedraggled, beaten and defeated as humanly
possible.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: staring at her INK-STAINED FINGERS as Hogan
finishes fingerprinting her other hand.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He hands her a towel to wipe them off.
We know that dirty hands would drive the old Drew crazy. This Drew
merely tosses the towel into the garbage. Who gives a crap?</p>
<p><strong>int. holding cell - day</strong>: Drew sits among other
FEMALE CRIMINALS, staring zombie- like. An INMATE with freaky frazzled
red hair and a whacked out look in her eye sidles over to Drew.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: I love your outfit.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Is it Bobo?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: would this woman</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: He’s a genius.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nyu - day</strong>: Warren and Parker leap from a cab
and hustle across campus. In only a few strides, Parker’s dusting
him.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Try to keep up, Warren!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Hey! I’m an intellectual! I never claimed to
be athletic!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: As a matter of fact, I was excused from P.E.
because of an ascended testicle! Too much information, right?</p>
<p><strong>int. holding cell - day</strong>: Red points at Drew’s one
shoe.</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Do you mind? I’m a fanatic for Jimmy Choo.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: MacLeod?</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: You’re free to go.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No thanks. I’ll just stay here with the
girls.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: An eyewitness says he saw who took the dog.
Didn’t realize the guy was stealing it until he saw us grab you.</p>
<p><strong>int. jail lobby - day</strong>: Hogan leads her into the
lobby where Bike Messenger Guy is waiting. He stands up when he sees
Drew. Her dissonance is even more confounded now.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: There’s your alibi.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I don’t even know him.</p>
<p><strong>hogan</strong>: That’s what he said. Go home. Get cleaned up,
a good night’s sleep. None of this will seem so bad in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>bike guy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>bike guy</strong>: I’m Jim Wessler.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Thanks, Jim. How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who could forget that face?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Huh. No hives.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Well… bye.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wait. Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ext. nypd station house - day</strong>: Jim catches up to
her.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Thanks for getting me out of jail but I have
to go home now because my entire life is ruined.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Bad day, huh?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You turn understatement into an art.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Can you just tell me your name? Please?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m Drew MacLeod. The girl who won’t be going
to the NYU Accelerated Program.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Because short of flying, there’s no way to get
from here to NYU in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure there is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nyu administration building</strong>: Parker’s on the
stairs with Drew’s DAYBOOK open, staring into it like someone who has a
final exam in two minutes but forgot to show up for the semester.
Warren’s looking over her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Wow. And I thought I was anal.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: This is no good. I don’t do too well with
the whole rehearsal thing. I’m more of a ‘wing it’ person.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How’s this look? Drewish?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: You know, I’ve always had a thing for
librarians.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Warren, honesty is fine. But you could edit
a little, you know?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Good luck, Drew.</p>
<p><strong>int. nyu administration building - close on a hand</strong>:
about to knock on a door that reads “Professor Que Spaulding, PhD” when
the door suddenly opens and the last INTERVIEWEE steps out in a suit and
tie, confidence oozing. Parker nods primly as he passes, then steps
inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. outer office - continuous action - day</strong>: A
SECRETARY sits at her computer. She looks over her glasses at
Parker.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m here to see Professor Spaulding.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: You don’t have an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Um, no. However…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: This is when the inner office door
swings open and the PROFESSOR himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in
the other, steps out. Parker positions herself directly in front of him,
cutting off his EXIT.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Professor Spaulding?</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: May I have a moment of your time?</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: I’m sorry, but I have a plane
to catch.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I know. But this is very important.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: What is this about?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Life and death, if you must know.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m Drew MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Ms. MacLeod, I hope this is
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nyu campus - day</strong>: STUDENTS leisurely make their
way between classes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yo! Coming through!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Students dive out of the way as Jim
comes barreling across campus with Drew clinging for life to his
handlebars. Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the
brakes and Drew FLIES OFF THE HANDLEBARS and like the puppy in the
opening, disappears into a shrub.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Wait right there. I mean, I don’t want to be
bossy. You don’t have to stay right there, if you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll be right here.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>int. professor spaulding’s office - day</strong>: Parker sits
genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed just so at the ankles,
hands folded in her lap.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I promise you, though my missing the
deadline seems to suggest otherwise, my studies would never suffer on
account of my being unorganized. This was, and I think anyone who knows
me would vouch for this, a complete anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I was so thrown when my sister asked Bernard
to the dance that I simply failed to post the schedule request and
seeing it already checked off on my to-do list, I over-looked it until
after the deadline had passed.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Ms. MacLeod, I recall your
application being one of the strongest we received. Not seeing your name
on the interview list surprised me. I assumed, of course, that you’d
changed your mind.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: No. Not at all. This program is my number
one priority.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Yes, well, I’m sure you can
appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be
rules to govern the selection process.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Professor Spaulding? I can’t apologize enough
for barging in like this.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: No. Please. It looks like I’m
taking the red-eye now anyway.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Parker?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hi, Parker.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, the Professor and I have had a wonderful
talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister,
Drew, who screwed things up.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: I’m having a little trouble
following this.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You were… being me?</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Would you like to sit down?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: When I saw them take you to jail…</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Jail?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: … I didn’t think you’d make it. I knew I
wouldn’t be any good at it, but I figured at least there was a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: That’s… sweet.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re not mad?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m so sorry for today.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It’s okay. But let’s talk about it later.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Please. Go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Parker, consider, just for a moment, whether
this is the appropriate time and place.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Okay, I considered. What I want to say is, I
didn’t purposefully set out to ruin your day, but that doesn’t mean I’m
not a little… jealous.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Jealous?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I’m not like you. I don’t have your
intensity, your focus, your…</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Fashion sense?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I just mean, maybe, even if I don’t intend
to, maybe that jealousy, you know, gets in the way sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: You mean subliminally you’re undermining
me?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I don’t know if I’d get that technical about
it. But yeah.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Well, thank you for saying that.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You’re welcome. Aren’t you going to confess
now?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Confess what?</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: There’s got to be something.
Like how you lost your shoes?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: How you’re secretly jealous of me?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Why would I be jealous of you?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, let me see. Because I don’t have a stick
up my butt? Because I know how to have fun? Because I’m spontaneous and
creative and men are all my love slaves?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Well, maybe about the love slaves.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Professor, I’m Drew MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: Are you certain?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I wanted more than anything in the world to be
a part of your program. I still do. But I failed. I didn’t follow the
rules. And honestly, before today, I didn’t know how I was going to live
with that. How to live with failure. I’m not good at it. I haven’t done
it much. But today I realized that I’ve lived in fear of it too
long.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I hope my application was a strong one and I
came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into
consideration. If you won’t, I’ll understand. Better yet, I’ll get over
it. Maybe I shouldn’t be in such a hurry after all. Maybe it would be
best for me to just take this…</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: … and lighten up.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Thanks for your time. Sorry if you missed your
plane.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: It was worth it, I assure you.
Now, could you clear up one thing for me?</p>
<p><strong>drew/parker</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>professor spaulding</strong>: What’s this about jail?</p>
<p><strong>ext. nyu administration building</strong>: Warren and Jim sit
waiting when the Girls come out, smiling. Drew turns to Parker.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sis?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Hi, baby!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I was in the city. I tried to call you.
Thought you might want a ride home.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Is that a new outfit?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Yeah. Hey, one minute, ’kay?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You want to maybe… get together?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: First I want to take a shower. For about a
week.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Call me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You have a card? Aren’t you in high school?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Oh, man. I’m doomed. I’ll never get home
before them.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Sure you will.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Dad? Hey. I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>int. helicopter - day</strong>: Passing over the City, Warren
and Parker are strapped in, headphones on, and have to talk above the
DIN.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Warren, something tells me you’re
spoiled!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Yes! But in a good way!</p>
<p><strong>int. girls’ bathroom - evening</strong>: Both girls are
putting on makeup, getting ready to go out. Everything appears the same
as before, Drew’s side neat and clean, Parker’s a wreck.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Girls?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: How naive do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: We, uh, don’t think you’re naive, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No. Honestly, it was all an accident.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I know what this is.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Parker, I’m disappointed you’d do something
like this without consulting me, but Drew? What got into you? Do you
know how unhygienic those places are?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It was… spontaneous.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Yeah. Obviously. Oh, by the way…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: This came in the mail.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: So? Open it.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: The guys are here!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: It doesn’t really matter one way or the other.
Maybe I shouldn’t be in such a hurry. Why don’t we go out and have some
fun. Besides, if this isn’t good news, I don’t want it to ruin our
night.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: So, how’d you two meet the girls?</p>
<p><strong>jim/warren</strong>: A dance/A class.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Dance class, huh? Stupid me. I figured it
had to be that day in New York when Parker blew off her chem test and
Drew was in jail.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Chips?</p>
