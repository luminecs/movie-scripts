<h1 id="cruel-intentions">cruel-intentions</h1>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Jesus. We’ve been at this for six
months.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: And you haven’t made an ounce of
progress.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: There’s no smoking in my office.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What do you want me to say? That I’m
supposed to feel remorse because I act the way I do? The truth is I
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: But you said you have the worst
reputation.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Don’t you want to change that?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks
love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don’t, but they don’t mean it.
They all think that they’re the ones that are going to “save me.” The
trick is to let them think it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: I think that’s all the time we have
for today.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Same time next week?</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: No. This is going to be our last
session.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why? I like spending time with you. You
know, you’re quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer
legs. Killer.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: This isn’t a joke. Your parents spend
a lot of money to send you here. I’m trying to help you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Don’t be insecure, Doc. You’re a big
help.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: You think you can come in here with
that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It
doesn’t work, Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It works a little.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: No it doesn’t. I see right through
you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: I hope for your sake you grow out of
this immature phase. It’s going to get you into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, you don’t have to get nasty about
it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: My daughter, Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yummy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Don’t even think about it. Rachel is
an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending
Princeton this fall. She’s way too smart to fall for your line of
b.s.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Really? Care to make a wager on that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Good luck, Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What, nervous I’m going to win?</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Would you please leave.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hi, mom.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Honey, is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He told me he loved me and I believed
him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t know him. I’m so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Alright honey, just calm down, take a
deep breath, and step out of the circle.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
mom. There’s pictures of me on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>we pan over to her computer console. close on:
computer</strong>: MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads “Ivy
League Bound.” Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to a bed
and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her privates.</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: What kind of pictures?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Nudie pictures, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: Jesus Christ, how can you be so
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t know. He was just so charming. All
he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to
photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there. Mom? Are you
there? Mom? Mother!!!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. greenbaum</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>meter maid</strong>: You can’t park there.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A
butcher knife comes down on the tuna cutting it’s head off.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Two hands ripping open the fish.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a
rice roll.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of
sushi through several doors until we enter the final door leading into
-</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: I can’t tell you how happy we are
that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You’ve
always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope
she can rise to the high standards which you’ve set for her.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’ll do my best.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a
beautiful language.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You’re too kind.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: How do you do it? I mean with all
peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your
strength?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I know this sounds corny, but whenever I
feel temptations of peer pressure,</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: turn to God and he helps me through the problem.
Call me an anachronism, but it works.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: That’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What are the boys like?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Cecile, is that the best you can do?
You must forgive her, Kathryn. She’s never been in a co-educational
atmosphere before.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s totally understandable.
Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding
gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Like your step-brother Sebastian. I
can’t believe they didn’t expel him after what he did to the school
nurse.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I hear she’s recovering quite well.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: You remember my daughter, Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: My, what an adorable shirt you’re
wearing.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: My father just took me on a trip to
Australia.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How are things down under? Blossoming I
hope.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile’s attending Oakwood in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What year are you in?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m what you would call a fifth year
senior.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: But I thought high school is only four
years.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It is, unless you’re a fuck up, like
myself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: I think we’ll be going now. Thanks
for all your help.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’ll call you later and we’ll get together
and plan your curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Thanks. Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ciao.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Let’s go, Cecile. Now!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do you care to tell me what
Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m just taking the poor girl under my
wing.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of
a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Hopefully, though she suspects that your
decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It was fine.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a
mission for you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
Reynolds?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You mean the Nazi who dumped you over
Fourth Of July Weekend?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: He didn’t dump me. We had a parting of the
ways.</p>
<p><strong>katmryn</strong>: I went to great lengths to please Court.
Huge sacrifices were made on my part to keep him happy.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Swallow?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: In any event, my feelings were hurt when I
learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste… pure…
innocent.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You don’t mean?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: None other than Cecile Caldwell.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I don’t find this very funny,</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: So that’s what this is all about. We’ll
get together and plan your curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Keep your friends close and your enemies
closer. When I get through with her, she’ll be the premier Blow Job
Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court’s heart will be
shattered.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why go through Cecile? Why not just
attack Court?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Because if there’s an attack made on Court
it could be traced back to me. I can’t allow that to happen. Everybody
loves me and I intend to keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I see your point… though why should I
care?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sounds intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: She’s quite cute you know. Young supple
breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh come on, Kathryn. It’s too easy. “But
I thought high school was only four years.” I mean, please. She knows
nothing. She’s seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar
sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron
friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh but diddling the therapist’s daughter is
a challenge?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That was just simple revenge. What I have
planned requires sheer genius.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m not interested in the latest dating
tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shut up and turn to page 64.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Jesus Christ, is she for real?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh yes. I’ve read it over and over again.
This baby’s the real deal. Daddy’s little angel. A paradigm of chastity
and virtue.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
Kansas and woo little Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It just so happens we’re not in Kansas
anymore. Our little angel’s father has accepted the new headmaster
position at Oakwood. She’s staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while
Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my
reputation? Screwing the new headmaster’s virginal daughter before
school starts? It will be my greatest victory.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You don’t stand a chance. Even this is out
of your league.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Care to make a wager on that?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’ll think about it…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
chapter to my work of art.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more
queer?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Could you be more desperate to read
it?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh Sebastian. About that little wager of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What are the terms?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
of yours is mine.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And if I win?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’ll give you something you’ve been jerking
off about ever since our parents got married.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Be more specific.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: In English. I’ll fuck your brains out.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What makes you think I’d go for that bet?
That’s a seventy thousand dollar car.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Because I’m the only person you can’t
control and it kills you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No way, that car means everything to
me.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You can put it anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Even there?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It would feel so yummy.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian’s aunt. The other rider is a
beautiful seventeen year old girl. The one and only ANNETTE
HARRISON.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: It’s a beautiful home you have here
Mrs. Rosemond.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much
riding?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: My mother and I used to ride a lot, before
she got sick.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: I’m sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
farm so I would come over and ride all the time.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: I’m familiar with a lot of breeders in
the mid-west. What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Ben Schwarz.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: Schwarz. Jewish?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: German.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: Doesn’t ring a bell.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Thank you. It’s so peaceful and quiet
around here.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: Sebastian must be here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Pull!</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: Sebastian!</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: I’ve missed you too. How are your
parents?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: They’re coming back next week. I write
them everyday.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
She’s going to be staying with me for a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I guess that makes two of us.
Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: Anything for you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian &amp; annette</strong>: We will.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: So what year are you going into?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Junior.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Got a boyfriend back home?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I don’t know. Relationships seem too
distracting. I’d rather concentrate on my studies.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You a lesbo?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Are you often this offensive on a first
encounter?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I was just being honest. You happen to
have a nice ass. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I read your teen beat manifesto.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I must say I found it rather
appalling.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: That’s a first. Most people praised me for
it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Most people are morons. I mean who are
you to knock what you’ve never experienced?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I wasn’t knocking anything. It’s just my
belief that people shouldn’t actually experience the act of love until
they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch
with those emotions.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Take yourself. You’ve slept with several
women. Are you happier because of it?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How do you know I’ve been with several
women?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: A friend wrote me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well maybe you should get to know the
person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit
gossip.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you… but
you still didn’t answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Who the hell is taking the time to write
letters, spreading this shit about me?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: It’s not really important.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Fine, forget it. It’s obvious that we’re
not going to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Why are you being so dramatic?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Look, I’ve got a lot of problems and I’m
trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading
shit about me.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Alright, I said I was sorry. Can we start
over again? I think we’ve gotten off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sebastian Valmont.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: That’s good, that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Oh, I suck. I suck.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Relax. It’s okay. Take a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>on kathryn</strong>: who watches from the door. A grin
crosses her face.</p>
<p><strong>on kathryn</strong>: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a
table which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt. Your
playing was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He’s
giving me music lessons over the summer.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Likewise I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Ronald is one of the few high school
students attending Juliard. He’s composing his first opera.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: It’s based on the life of Doctor Martin
Luther King.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Doctor King is my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: I guess our hour’s up. Same time
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: - none taken -</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
shit about me.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Any ideas who it could be?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
wouldn’t be alive right now.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Where did you say she’s from?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Kansas. Who the hell do I know in
Kansas?</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Greg McConnell.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The football stud?</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: He’s from Kansas City. I wouldn’t be
surprised if he was your rat.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I don’t think that bothered him.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Let’s just say Greg likes tackling tight
ends on and off the field.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Are you shitting me?</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in
my dorm room drunk every month. We’d go at it for a while, then as soon
as he’d cum, he starts freaking out. You know - “What are you doing,
man? I’m not a fag. I’ll kick your ass if you say anything.” It’s like,
for Christsakes Greg, you’re gay, deal with it. The only reason why I
let him continue with his charade is because he’s got a mouth like a
Hoover.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Too bad he’s in Kansas this summer.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Not anymore. Football team started practice
last week. He’s already called me to hook up.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Really. You think you could arrange a
little get together with him tonight on my behalf?</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
Spartacus on television tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Don’t think it’s not going to cost you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No problem. Just make sure your front
door is unlocked. Shall we say the “stroke of midnight” no pun
intended?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: So, rumor has it that you went on a date
with Court Reynolds. I hear he’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: He’s alright. He kept talking about this
bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Really? Bulimic headcase.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court’s
invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: You think so? I don’t know. I guess I’m just
scared.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What are you scared of?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Ah duh. Boys. I’ve never even gone to first
base with a guy. What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Haven’t you ever practiced with one of your
girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Eww. No. That’s gross.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s not gross. How else do you think girls
learn? Here turn around and face me.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Are you for real?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Do you want to learn or not?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I guess. It still sounds gross.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: See that wasn’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: It was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Let’s try it again, only this time I’m
going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to
massage my tongue with yours. That’s what first base is.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Eyes closed.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: That was cool.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Maybe you should try it on your friend
Ronald sometime.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh come on Cecile. He’s crazy about
you.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Is it that obvious?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: That’s so romantic. Have you responded?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well do you like him?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile, we just made out in the middle of
Central Park. You can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I do like him. I can’t stop thinking about
him.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Listen to me. Your mother must never know.
Never.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Did you hide the letters?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Yes. They’re in this antique doll house in
my room.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I want you to make me copies of his letters
and bring them to me.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile if there’s one thing I’m great at
it’s love letters. With my help, he’ll be eating out of the palm of your
hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at
my house.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: You’d do that for me?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Of course I would. We’re friends,
right?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Best friends.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Look, I know this is your house and all,
but do you think you couid keep it down? I’m trying to read.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What’cha reading?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: The Fountainhead.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Great book.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You’ve read The Fountainhead?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Several times. I’m not as dumb as I act,
you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon… most
romantic scene in all of literature.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Romantic? He rapes her.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That’s a matter of opinion.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You need help.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why don’t you come join me for a swim and
we’ll discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: At this hour? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric
and get in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Gee, with an invitation like that how could
a girl refuse.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Give me a minute. I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Fuck her yet?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Loser.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Blow me.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Call me later.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sook-hee</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You know it amazes me that someone as
bright as you can be so horrible.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What? Another letter from your
friend?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: This is my favorite part. Even more
treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has
never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some
dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully
pursued has regretted it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You know you could at least have the
decency of telling me who’s badmouthing me so I might have the
opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it’s not some
girl who’s pissed off at me for breaking up with her?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I sincerely doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Give me the fucking letter.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: The last thing I need is you going into my
room searching for this while I’m away.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Is that the last thing you need? My your
clever.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: How’s the water?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: About what you said today in the stable.
I’m not a happy person.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I never said that.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You implied it.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Look, I didn’t mean to give you a hard
time.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No, it’s okay. I mean I look at you with
all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your
choices. I envy you. No bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Seriously, you’re amazing. You have
everything going for you. You’re smart, you’re beautiful, you’re
determined. You’re everything I want in a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I wasn’t kidding. I’d like to take you
out.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Look, I’m flattered but, seriously it could
never work.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Because you act like a pig.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do you deny that there’s an attraction
between us?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I don’t… I don’t want to answer that… look
we’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You don’t find me cute? Come on, look at
these muscles.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m sorry, but you’re not my type.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
that.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You’re naked.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It’s my house.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: That’s repulsive.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What’s the big deal? We’re friends.
Haven’t you ever seen your friends naked before?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Get some manners.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sorry, I didn’t know you were
peenaphobic.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Oh baby… oh baby…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Baby? Right on time.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Oh God… Oh God, I’m gonna cum. I’m gonna cum…
I’m gonna…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hey Blaine, did I leave my… holy
shit.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Greg, is that you under the covers?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: I told you to lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I thought I did.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Look Valmont. This was the first time I’ve
ever done something like this. I was –</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: – really drunk and blah blah blah blah
blah.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Please don’t tell anyone. This could ruin my
career.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Your career? What about your family? Can
you imagine the humiliation your father’s going to feel when he finds
out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he’s not a
fudge packer. Cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Please. I’m begging you. I’ll do anything.
Let’s just forget the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hmmmmmmm… nah. I can’t help you there.
It’s too good to pass up.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Annette Harrison? I don’t know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Come on Greg. You’re the only one who
knows her. The truth will save you.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: I swear on my life, I never said a word to her
about you.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: I think he’s telling the truth Valmont. Greg
couldn’t write a grocery list let alone a letter.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your
secret’s safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>blaine</strong>: Our boy just can’t get enough dick.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: You sick son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’ll leave you guys alone. Score one for
the team, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you
an apology.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m not going to speak to you till you
realize that you can’t intimidate me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I said I was sorry.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: It was fine.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I wish I could say the same for myself. I
was up thinking about you all night.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I thought we agreed that we were going to
be friends.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes, well unfortunately I can’t just
switch the “on” button to “off.” The sad fact of the matter is that
you’ve unintentionally rubbed off on me.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: And that’s a bad thing?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m trying to better myself, but the one
person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m sorry, but I’m not here to be your
savior.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well try this one on for size. I think
I’m falling in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You don’t even know me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Don’t you believe in love at first
sight?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Yes, but only when it’s mutual. And this is
far from mutual.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
time together this morning?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I can’t. I’m seeing a friend.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How about tonight?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: That’s also none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
win your heart. I’ll do anything. I can’t get you out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You truly want to do something to make me
happy?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: And you promise to abide by it?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Without question.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Alright. I want you to leave and go back to
New York.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: If that’s a problem, then I’ll make
arrangements to stay with some friends.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’ll leave this afternoon. Happy?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: It’s not about being happy. You and I can’t
-</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: He told you he’s failing in love with you?
I’ve never known him to say those words before.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Really? I thought he said it all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: That’s not his style. one thing I can say
about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Is there a mutual feeling between you two?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: No. I mean. I don’t know. What else do you
know about him?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Not a whole lot. We take some classes
together. He’s got a bad rep, but it’s mostly bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he’s
loaded.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve been hearing some awful
things about him.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: From who?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I can’t tell you. I’m sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Annette, how long have we known each
other?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Forever.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Now it’s my job to look out for you. You’re
like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You promise not to say anything?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: On my mother’s life.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That nosey bitch. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Did you do everything I asked you to?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You told her I never said I love you
before?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You told her that people are jealous
cause I’m loaded?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And you think she bought it?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: I’m pretty sure she did.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Pretty sure or sure sure?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: She bought it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Enough with the music. Fuck her
already.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You would not believe what–</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: That was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Almost as beautiful as you.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Well, I guess it’s getting late. Please
thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Idiot!</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the
image.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You ready for this? I’ve recently
discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the
letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I now plan to devote all my energies to
destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Call Cecile up and get her to come over.
I’ll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile
has fallen for her music teacher.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ooo, I’m sure Mrs. Caldwell will love
that.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Not to mention Court Reynolds.
Unfortunately, Ronald’s moving with the speed of a Special Olympic
Bobsledder.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What’s your plan of attack?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes
ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: But who will they turn to for help?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile is planning to go away with Court
next week. I’ll need you to speed up her sexual awakenings.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m at your service.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh sis. You’re so tense.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I hate when things don’t go my way. It
makes me so horny.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I hate it too.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Moving along quite well.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Have you succeeded in your task?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Any day now.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well, let me know when you do. Until
then.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Goodbye Mister Bond.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: No, not at all.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, I was just calling to see how
you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m… I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How was your date?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: It wasn’t a date. He’s just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, I was just calling to tell you I
was thinking about you and I miss you. I’ll let you go.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Wait, don’t hang up.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Reading.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Of Human Bondage.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Somerset Maugham.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah, it’s pretty relevant considering my
situation.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You’re not gonna start that again.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No. I’m through with my childish games
when it comes to you. Hold on, that’s my other line. Rub.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Sure. Have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>gretchen</strong>: Of Human Bondage. You’re such a bullshit
artist.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shut up, Gretchen. You don’t even know
what it is.</p>
<p><strong>gretchen</strong>: Duh, it’s a book.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do you know what it’s about?</p>
<p><strong>mora</strong>: Who cares. Books are for fags.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Books are for fags. I weep for the
future.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Here’s something you might like.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Do you carry any real fur?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: No. All our fur is faux.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Of course. The animals. How silly of
me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: I got your message and came as quick
as I could.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I hope I didn’t keep you from
something.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Not at all. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well… you promise you won’t say anything to
her. We’ve developed a friendship and…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Kathryn, you have my word. It isn’t
drugs is it?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s worse. I think there’s something going
on between Cecile and her music teacher.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Ronald? That’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I know. She’s so young and he’s so -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Black.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: He’s been sending her love letters that she
hides under her doll house. I questioned whether or not to tell you, but
something like this could destroy her reputation at Oakwood and I don’t
want to see her get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: I can’t thank you enough.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You will be discreet about this?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Will that be cash or charge?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Let me get that for you.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh please. I can’t have you do that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: It’s the least I can do.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Who the hell do you think you
are?!</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: I’m paying you to give cello lessons.
Not to pervert my child.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Mrs. Caldwell I think you’re
misunderstanding something.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Where did you find those?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Margarita found them while cleaning
your room.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Those are my letters!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Don’t you raise your voice at me. Go
to your room, now.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and
Park.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Whatever. You are never to set foot
in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my
daughter again. Is that understood?!</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: First of all, maam, I never touched your
daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone
of your status could look beyond racial lines.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Oh don’t give me any of that racist
crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you
for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Took me off the streets?</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Wow. I never knew she had these kind of
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You’re a lucky guy.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: She really loves me.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What do you do? Tell her you love her.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: But I can’t even see her. She doesn’t have
her own phone, I don’t even know her e-mail address.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ronald, e-mail’s for geeks and
pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: How will I get to her?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian &amp; kathryn</strong>: We’ll make sure she gets
it.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Why are you being so good to me?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Because we want to see Cecile happy and we
know you make her happy.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Who are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Before we go through with this, I just
want you to be aware of the damage we’re going to cause.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m aware.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Are you really? I mean, we’ve done some
pretty fucked up shit in our time but this… I mean, we’re destroying an
innocent girl. You do realize that.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What is that? Oh my God, it’s your
conscience.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You amaze me.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Eat me, Sebastian. It’s alright for you to
fuck everyone, but because I’m a girl it’s wrong. Well let me tell you
something, I didn’t ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact
that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be
considered a “laaaady.” Do you think I take great delight when I hear -
“Kathryn is so wonderful.” “Kathryn is a model child.” “Kathryn is going
to make an excellent wife one day.” I’m the Marsha fucking Brady of the
upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don’t
enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around
me is going to suffer. So there’s your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now
are you in or are you out?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
very carefully. I have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to
you. Now I can’t exactly bring it to your house, since your mother
despises me so here’s what we’re going to do.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Finished.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: You think he’ll like it?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: He’ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Just taking your photo.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I look terrible.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Mmmm, you’re right. Those clothes don’t
do you justice. Why don’t you take them off.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I’m getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m sorry that was out of line.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I was just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay, okay. I’ll just call your mom and
have her come pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: My mom? Don’t call my mom.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why not? … Oh wow, she doesn’t know
you’re here. In fact, you’re grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Please please please. I’ll do anything. Just
don’t call my mom.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Cecile, all I want to do is give you a
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: And then I can go home?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Of course. I’m not a monster.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Just a kiss, right?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I swear.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You promised to let me kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: But -</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I don’t want to kiss you here. I want to
kiss you there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Cecile are you up yet? We’re gonna to
be late for the -</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I’m in the bath, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Well hurry up. I want to be at
Mrs. Rosemond’s before lunch.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: It was nice of you to invite us up
for the weekend, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: More the merrier. Is everything alright
my dear?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I’m just not feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Afternoon ladies.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: I didn’t know you’d be here,
Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I wasn’t planning on it, but being such a
lovely day, why waste it in the city. Anyone for tennis?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I hope she’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>aunt helen</strong>: I better go check on them.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Alone again. What are you up to
today?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m doing some volunteer work.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Need any company?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You? Volunteer? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I don’t know? Maybe I’d like it. I’m
trying to change here. You could be supportive.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Babe, you’re looking at the next Mother
Teresa.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Please. I need you. I don’t know what to do.
You’re the only one I can talk to.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’ll be there in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It’s really nice when the young people help
out. Most of our patients don’t have any family nearby.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sugerman</strong>: Did I ever tell you the time when my
late husband sent me -</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes, you already did.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sugerman</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Right after we played backgammon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sugerman</strong>: We played backgammon?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Uh huh. You beat me three times.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sugerman</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sugerman</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I said, do you want some water?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sugerman</strong>: Oh… no thank you…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: How we doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sugerman</strong>: I won three games of backgammon.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It’s weird. I actually feel good about
myself. Can we do this again next week?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Oh please.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: “I actually feel good about myself?”</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You must take me for a real idiot.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You’re going to tell me that you had a good
time with the old lady.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I did. We played three games of
backgammon and…</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: That’s okay. It doesn’t make you a bad
person.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes it does.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: No, it doesn’t. I’m happy you’re being
honest with me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I can’t win with you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: It’s not about winning. You know what your
problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I do not.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Lighten up.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I am lighten. Can we drop this?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What are you doing? Stop it, it’s
distracting.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Oh dear, are you actually laughing?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: There’s hope for you, yet.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s Kathryn.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Calm down. Tell me what’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Something awful happened last night.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What do you mean?!</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I… I don’t think you want to know.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile, you have to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: It involves your brother. He… took advantage
of me.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Does your mother know?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: If she knew, she’d kill me. It happened at
your house last night.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Why didn’t you do something?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: So, let me get this straight. You came over
to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Well… not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: He made you give him a blow job.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well what then?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: If that’s what you call it.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile, I think you’re going to have a hard
time crying rape if that’s all he did.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: What do I do then?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well did you like it?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Well… I don’t know - it was weird. At first
it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really
hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don’t t know… it felt
like an explosion, but a good one.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile, you had an orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m so proud of you. You’re becoming a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Now listen. Now that you’re on your way, it
would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
instruct you.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I don’t love him. I love Ronald.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: So? Don’t you want to make Ronald a happy
pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
many people as possible.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: But that would make me a slut. Wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Cecile, everybody does it. It’s just that
nobody talks about it.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: It’s like a secret society.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: That’s one way of looking at it.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don’t
think she’ll be giving you anymore problems.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yippy.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Who are you spying on?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Take a look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: That her?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. Oh, she’s
crying. Wittle baby’s upset by the big bad book.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: She’s really getting to you, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: If you must know, yes. I don’t know what
to do. I can’t stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I’m
completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: And that’s why you’re losing your bet?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m not losing the bet. It’s just taking
longer than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a
ride?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Kathryn, the only thing you’re going to
be riding is me. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some work to do.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Am I bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Not at all. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Don’t tell me you finished The
Fountainhead already?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Florentino Ariza.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of
Florentino.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Who’s Monsieur Philipe?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You don’t know Monsieur Philipe?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You are very pretty. I would like to kiss
you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That felt good too. I will kiss you all
over.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I am too.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You know what? I don’t take it back.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Because I’m in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I thought you said we were going to be
friends.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I can’t handle it. I can’t keep my
feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel
nothing for me? … Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I have feelings for you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Then what’s wrong? I love you Annette.
It’s not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: That’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why can’t we be together?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You really want to know?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: It’s because I don’t trust myself with you.
I took a vow and because of you I’m tempted to break it. Don’t destroy
that for me. Please.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Want to join me?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Some other time, Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Am I suppose to be this sore?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: For the first time, yes. It’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I like it better when I’m on top.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet
time. This is time when we reflect on what we’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Is it me?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No, you were fine.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: It’s that girl, Annette.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m taking a shower.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Need any company?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Want a blow job?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Good night Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Prude.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I just came to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Back to the city. I may take off to
Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can’t handle it around
here.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I think that’s for the best.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Sebastian, please. I don’t want us to end
on bad terms.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, I’m afraid you don’t have a choice
in the matter. You make me sick. You’re a hypocrite and I don’t
associate with hypocrites.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: How am I a hypocrite?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh please Annette. You spend all your
time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front
of you, but you’re going to turn your back on it. I’m sorry that we’re
not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I’d propose, but
that’s not going to happen. So I guess we’re just fucked. I’ll move on,
but you… you’re going to have to live with yourself knowing you’ve
turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Please don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Get off me.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I… I want you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Morning!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: So? How’d it go last night?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well I know how it went with Cecile. She
won’t shut up about it. How’d it go with Mrs. Jesus?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: If your asking if I nailed her the answer
is no.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: She shot you down.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Exactly the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: So what went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I don’t know. She was lying on the bed,
ready to do it, but I– I don’t, I was… I just didn’t feel right about
it.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You’re telling me you had the chance to
fuck her and you didn’t. God are you a chump.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be
rectified.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: If you’re heading towards her room, you
won’t find her.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You don’t know? She left thirty minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Where’d she go?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: She wouldn’t say. She apologized to your
aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. You blew it,
Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near
you again.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: We’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Is she with you?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with
you?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Where is she?!</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: I don’t know. Why don’t you leave her
alone.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: McConnell, I’m gonna out your ass in two
seconds if you don’t tell me where she is.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: I told you I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Alright. She’s staying with some friends of
her parents. The O’Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into
Grand Central.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Grand Central. You better not be fucking
with me cause it’s your ass on the line.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ooops.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’m fine. I have to get going to my
friends’ house. Was it –</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It was perfect.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You work way to hard. Here. Take the day
off. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Slower.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: A little to the left. Look, pretend like
you’re writing the alphabet. A… B… mmm, stay on B.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: One second.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Bad time?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, you obviously wanted me to witness
your little adventure or else you wouldn’t have invited me in.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: It’s not what it seems like.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Say hi to Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Tell me all the details.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It was… Fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh come on. For her first time?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know. That’s the amazing part of it. I
mean, it wasn’t like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard
missionary stuff, but it was… ah forget it. I’m going to sound like a
Hallmark card.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: No, tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It was… it was like the emotional part
outweighed the physical part.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the
birds chirping.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Mock, mock, mock.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: So I assume you’ve come here to make some
arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Some other time.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m not in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: And that’s why you’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It clearly is why.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I want to fuck.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’ll pick you up in an hour. I love you
too.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Oh my God. You’re completely p-whipped.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: P-whipped, p-whipped.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What’s wrong with you? Why are you acting
this way?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just upsetting. You’re in
love with her. You don’t love me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
contest.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: At first it was, but now it’s become
something bigger.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Kathryn, you know I love you. I’ve always
loved you.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Not anymore you don’t. It’s obvious.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I can’t believe you’re reacting this way.
You’re just saying this because you lost the bet.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That’s not fair. You’re taking all the
fun out of it.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If
not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You’re a joke. She’s
turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who
walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect
you. They feared you and now you’re going to throw that all away.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Why so nervous?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’ve never done this before.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: How have you dumped girls in the past?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Screening calls. Any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I knew this guy last summer in the
Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each
other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him
mercilessly about it. You know, “How do you breathe when she sits on
your face?” “It’s embarrassing for you to be seen with her.” Finally he
couldn’t take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he
went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing
over and over again. “I’m completely fucked up.” “I’m completely fucked
up.” “I’m completely fucked up.” Poor fatty never had a chance.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Don’t be weak.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hi. Is Annette at home?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: You must be Sebastian. I’ve heard such
nice things about you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: Well, I’m going to head back to the
kitchen. You two have fun.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Would you like a tour?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: And this is my room.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: This isn’t working out for me
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It’s not you, it’s me. I’m completely
fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why aren’t you understanding?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know. I wish I felt the same.
Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry,
I’m completely fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Why are you trying to hurt me?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m just being honest. I just wanted to
see what you were like in bed.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You don’t know how to love.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You don’t even know me. The fact of the
matter is there is some one I love. She’s smarter, prettier… you don’t
even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us
to be exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: But you knew this was important to me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What, your virginity? Well that’s over
now.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Please go.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sorry. I’m completely fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: A little melodramatic, don’t you think.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I have a flair for drama.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Mind if I ask what you’re doing in my
room?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You wanted an answer to your
question.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Annette?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she’ll
ever trust a man again.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I thought we should celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’d love to, but unfortunately I’m
expecting some company.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ronald?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Not that it’s any of your business but
yes.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: From Ronald.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Thank you. Now, where were we?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: To my triumph, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Not my choice of toast, but it’s your
call. To your triumph over Annette.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Silly rabbit. My triumph isn’t over her.
It’s over you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You were very much in love with her and
you’re still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of
it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you
names. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered that you chose me over her, but
please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You’re just a toy. A
little toy I play with. And now you’ve completely blown it with her. I
think that’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: In any event, you still owe me my
reward.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m sorry, but unfortunately I don’t fuck
losers.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Will you calm down?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Fine! Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m very sorry about that. I
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I accept. Now get out.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Get out? We had an arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Didn’t you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I don’t care what you said, we had an
agreement. You’ve slept with half of the borough so don’t tell me you’re
being choosy.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m giving you to the count of three to
plop your ass down on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: And if I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Then I will consider it a declaration of
war. One. Two… three.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I think you have your answer.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: War it is.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It’s desperate that I talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: I’ve already told you, she’s not
home.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well please leave a message that I
called.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I need to talk to Annette.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do you know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: She’s out.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do you know when she’ll be back?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: Later. Listen, we’re entertaining some
guests so -</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Annette! Annette!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: Young man, I already told you she’s not
here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Fine. Could you please see that she gets
this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It’s really important.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’shea</strong>: I understand. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Ronald?</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s Kathryn.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s Sebastian. He’s out of his mind.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I think he’s high on drugs. He hit me, then
took off. I’m afraid to be alone. Please come over.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Dear Annette. Thank you for reading this
letter. I don’t know what I can possibly say to rectify the harm I have
caused you. For once in my life I’m at a loss for words.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The truth of the matter is that being
with you was the only time I have ever been happy. My whole life has
been a joke. I prided myself on taking joy in others’ misery.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
in hurting the first person I loved. I wish more than anything I could
take it back, but I guess that’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Enclosed is my most prized possession… my
journal. For a long time I considered it my trophy. A sordid collection
of my conquests. If you really want to know the truth, then please read
it. No more lies.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: A car is picking me up tomorrow and
taking me to Martha’s Vineyard, where we have a summer home. Nothing
would make me happier than if you joined me. I’m a fucking wreck without
you. If you’re interested please meet me outside my building at nine. If
not, I understand. Love, Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: And when I confronted him about his affair
with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said
“Well what about Ronald,” he said you were nothing more than a stupid…
the n word and that you deserved what you got…</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: And this happened before you and I hooked
up?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: It’s been going on for a while. Then he
called me a disgrace to our family and that’s when he hit me.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Racist piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’d be careful if I were you. God knows
what he’s up to.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: He doesn’t scare me. I’ll kick his ass
in.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Will you stay here for the night? You can
leave in the morning. That’s when my parents get back and –</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Thanks Ronald. You’re a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>night doorman</strong>: Eight o’clock. You got to go.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Did she show up?</p>
<p><strong>night doorman</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do you mind if I check upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>night doorman</strong>: I can’t have you do that, nor can I
have you hanging around the lobby all day.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I understand. Thanks for letting me crash
here.</p>
<p><strong>night doorman</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hey Ronald.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: It seems that you and I have some talking to
do.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Can we do it later. I’ve had a really bad
night and -</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Where the hell do you come off hitting
women?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Kathryn. Did you hit her?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you
too?</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Did you hit her?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ronald, you don’t know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Don’t know what I’m talking about? I know
that you fucked Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ronald, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Sebastian!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m okay. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Get an ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m okay. Everything’s good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: Sad, sad, sad. To think of the
opportunities that boy had. This should be a lesson to us all that our
children need constant supervision.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. caldwell</strong>: It’s all about quality time.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: He loved that view.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I can see why.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m Kathryn.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Annette Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Did you know Sebastian well?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You might say that.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your
father’s the new headmaster at Oakwood.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: I’m sure you’re going to love it there.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Well, I’ll leave you alone now. I just came
in here to get something of mine.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Look, I know this sounds corny, but
whenever I feel like I can’t go on I… turn to Jesus and he helps me
through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Who the hell do you think you are coming
into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have
some respect.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Kathryn, I know all about you and
Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: Sebastian was a pathological liar. I
wouldn’t believe a word he -</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I have his journal.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: His journal. He sent it to me the day
before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand
jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your
guidance counselor and how he gave you… eww. Let’s see, then there’s
your coke problem… You still keep it in your crucifix, don’t you? It’s
all in there.</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You didn’t show it to anybody?</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Actually, I was planning on running down to
Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?</p>
<p><strong>kathryn</strong>: You can’t do this to me. It could ruin
me.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian’s bed,
utterly defeated.</p>
<p><strong>cue up</strong>: The Carpenter’s singing “Goodbye To
Love.”</p>
