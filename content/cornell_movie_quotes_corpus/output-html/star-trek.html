<p><strong>younger midwife</strong>: The baby is healthy. Why does she
cry?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: She is human.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Sarek arrives.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Your tone suggests disappointment. The
Science Council required my presence for a session regarding–</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Don’t do that. You knew I wanted you
here.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
traditionally not present at the moment of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Well traditionally, I’m not the one giving
birth.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: I moved here – to another planet – to be
with you. I needed you to be with me today. Holding my hand and telling
me I’m doing great, even when I’m just… breathing the best I can.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: You are correct. I should have been here. I
am sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: I had a thought. That we might name the child
after one of our respected early society-builders. His name was
“Spock”.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Your silence does not suggest enormous
enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: No… Spock. … Spock.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: The child has your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: … and your ears.</p>

the Nothing even close, Sir. closest match on registry?</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Any response?</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: No Sir – hails met with silence.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Maybe they’re incapable – any
identifiable damage?</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: Negative, Sir – but our readings seem
confused–</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Confused?</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: – not only is the ship unregistered –
but even its construction materials seem unrecognizable.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: … oh my God… A lightning storm… then
this… Signal all departments: first contact protocols. Looks like we
have someone new on the block. All Stop.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Sir, should we initiate an invasive
scan?</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: That could be seen as an act of
provocation – all readings passive–</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts captain robau</strong>: Sir, I have a reading –
they’ve locked weapons on us! – Red alert! Arm weapons!</p>
<p><strong>first officer captain robau</strong>: Torpedo locked on us at
320 degrees, mark two – incoming – Evasive pattern Delta-5! fast!</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Damage report!</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never
seen anything like it! Weapons off-line! Main power at 38 percent!</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: – what was that– what’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: – you’re okay– thank God– where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: Medical bay– I had a few close contractions–
I’m fine– what was that?</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Just sit tight– stay there– we’ll be
fine–</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: They’re firing another, Captain!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman officer pitts</strong>: – life support failing on –

<p><strong>ayel</strong>: My commander requests the presence of your
captain in order to negotiate a cease-fire. You will come aboard our
ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal would be unwise.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Walk with me.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: If I don’t report within fifteen
minutes, execute general order 13.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Sir, we could issue a mayday call
to–</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: There is no help for us out here. If
we’re going down, we’re taking them with us – you save as many as you
can.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: … aye, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: You’re Captain now. Mr. Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau’s
vital signs to the main view screen.</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>science officer</strong>: Vitals on line.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Computer, initiate departure
sequence.</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: The shuttle’s pulling out of main
bay, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I want to see him – floodlights
please.</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: His heart rate’s elevated–</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: He’s scared.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: He’s brave. That’s what he is.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: Are you familiar with this craft?</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Who is your commander? Is it him?</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: You will speak only to me.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: Then ask your commander what right he
has to attack a Federation vessel.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: That was hardly an attack. My commander will
easily destroy your ship. If you do not respond to the question.</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: I’ve never seen it. Or any ship like
it.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: Are you familiar with – or better, know the
location of – Ambassador Spock?</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: I am unfamiliar with Ambassador
Spock.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: A final question. What is the current
stardate?</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: … Stardate? … it’s 2233.04. … hey,
where are you from–?</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts george kirk</strong>: They’re launching again!
Evasive! Evasive! Delta-Five</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I’m initiating General Order 13! Set
self-destruct for maximum matter- antimatter yield! Two minute
countdown!</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts</strong>: Yessir!</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I want auto-pilot targeted for their
fuel cells!</p>
<p><strong>tactical officer</strong>: Sir, unable to locate the ship’s
power source!</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: Then just target the damn thing dead
center!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: We got bigger problems: the first hit
destroyed auto-pilot!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: The only way we’re gonna ram that ship is
to fly manual control!</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: – then I’ll do it myself – get to the
shuttles, now!</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: All decks, this is the Captain speaking
– evacuate the ship immediately, get to your designated shuttle crafts
–</p>
<p><strong>george kirk winona</strong>: – repeat: evacuate ship and get
to designated shuttles – that’s George’s voice – NOW! what’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: We’re packing it up – you’ll deliver in the
shuttle!</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: – George!</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I have medical shuttle 37 standing by,
get to it now – can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: Yes – where are you?</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: Good– and George, it’s coming– our baby,
it’s coming now.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I’ll see you in a minute,
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: – Agh! That was– that was a big one!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Just keep breathing, Honey, you’re gonna be
just fine–</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: – the baby, too, right?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: – the baby too.</p>
<p><strong>countdown to self-destruct</strong>: and another reads IMPACT
PROXIMITY .</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: Captain to shuttle 37 – is my wife on
board?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle pilot</strong>: Yessir, she is–</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I need you to go now, d’you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>shuttle pilot</strong>: We’re waiting for you, Sir–</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: No– go, take off, immediately.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle pilot</strong>: … yessir!</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: Wait! We can’t go, my husband isn’t here
yet! Please! STOP–!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You’ll need to push now– are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: The shuttle’s leaving– where are you?</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: My love? Listen carefully, okay?</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: – we’re about to have this baby –</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: Sweetheart… I’m not going to be able to
be there.</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: – no– no, no– wait–</p>
<p><strong>george kirk winona</strong>: I want you to hear me. Please.
Are you still on the ship? No- – There’s no other way– my - no, you need
to be here– love– you know all I want– – George, I can’t do this all I
want in the world is to without you– be with you–</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Okay– you need to push.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: Hey! Hey, so what is it?</p>
<p><strong>winona’s voice</strong>: – it’s a boy.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: It’s a boy? Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: Tell me… tell me about him– please–</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: He’s– he’s beautiful, he looks like you.</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: George, you should be here –</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: I know– so what should we call him,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: We could name him after your father.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk</strong>: Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No,
that’s the worst– we’ll name him after your dad– let’s call him Jim.</p>
<p><strong>winona</strong>: … Jim. Jim it is.</p>
<p><strong>george kirk winona</strong>: Sweetheart? Sweetheart? I love
you. Can you hear me? – yes– yes, I hear you… – I love you. I love
y–</p>
<p><strong>mayhem</strong>: ALARMS and CREW work to stabilize the ship –
we arrive at Nero, who, with small specks of HUMAN BLOOD on his face,
just STARES at the fucking HOLOGRAM OF SPOCK – he’s OBSESSED.</p>
<p><strong>appears – decloaking from nothingness</strong>: a fucking
KLINGON VESSEL – then ANOTHER – AND ANOTHER –</p>
<p><strong>klingon voice</strong>: Trespassing vessel: you have entered
the jurisdiction of the Klingon Empire. Power down and prepare to be
boarded or you will be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: Commander Nero – we’re surrounded.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: Sir– what are your orders?</p>
<p><strong>computer voice spock</strong>: What is the square root of
2,396,304? – one-thousand-five-hundered- – Correct. What is the central
assumption of Quantum – everything that can happen Cosmology? does
happen, in equal and – Correct. Identify the 20th century earth
composers of the following musical progression: – Paul McCartney and
John – Correct</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Your score is one-hundred percent.
Congratulations. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>young spock</strong>: I presume you’ve prepared new insults
for today.</p>
<p><strong>vulcan bully #1</strong>: Your mother lies with many men.</p>
<p><strong>young spock</strong>: I have no such information.</p>
<p><strong>vulcan bully #2</strong>: You are neither human, nor Vulcan –
and therefore, have no place in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>young spock</strong>: This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
elicit an emotional response from me. Logic dictates you would cease by
now.</p>
<p><strong>vulcan bully #1</strong>: Look. He has human eyes. They look
sad, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>vulcan bully #2</strong>: Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.</p>
<p><strong>vulcan bully #2</strong>: He’s a traitor, you know. Your
father. For marrying her.</p>
<p><strong>amanda sarek</strong>: – where I’m from, when someone hits
you, you hit back- - how is that not logical? – Spock had no reasonable
– They pick on him – they expectation of being tease him – every day.
physically injured – – I want him to embrace above all. Vulcan, you know
that… but he has to be himself– which means, occasionally, being – His
“humanity” is very the human. source of his ostracism. – When Vulcans
get disgusted with each other, they never just walk away, do they? –
No. – Well humans do.</p>
<p><strong>young spock</strong>: I did not mean to create conflict
between you and mother.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: In marriage… conflict is…</p>
<p><strong>young spock</strong>: … constant?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Natural. Emotions run deep within our race.
In many ways, more deeply than in humans. Long ago, they nearly
destroyed us… that is why we followed the teachings of Surak. Now you
must choose.</p>
<p><strong>young spock</strong>: … between you and mother?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic
of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control
of feelings… so that they do not control you.</p>
<p><strong>young spock</strong>: They called you a traitor. You suggest
that I should be completely Vulcan… and yet you married a human…
why?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe
and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother… was logical. Spock.
You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny. The question you are
faced with… is which path you will take. This is something only you can
decide.</p>
<p><strong>uncle frank</strong>: Go ahead: go– run away! You know I
could give a damn!</p>
<p><strong>young kirk</strong>: – wait– no! Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>george jr.</strong>: Anywhere but here, far as I can get!</p>
<p><strong>uncle frank</strong>: Which won’t be far enough – know what
your problem is?! No one ever taught you respect! How to follow orders!
Do as you’re told! – what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>young kirk</strong>: I– I just don’t want my brother to
go.</p>
<p><strong>uncle frank</strong>: Well I do– and I asked you to wash the
car! How many damn times do I need to repeat myself?! How many damn
times? How many?</p>
<p><strong>young kirk</strong>: Please stay– you can have my Flo-Yo!</p>
<p><strong>george jr.</strong>: This isn’t about toys, it’s Uncle Frank.
I can’t take him anymore – Mom has no idea what he’s like when she’s not
here– d’you hear him talking like he’s our dad?! And that’s not even his
car you’re washing! That was Dad’s car! You know why you’re washing it?
Because he’s gonna sell it!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t leave – okay? We can tell Mom when she
gets back from Africa.</p>
<p><strong>george jr.</strong>: She’s gone for five more months, by then
I’ll be in a different system. You’re gonna be okay. You always are.
Always doing everything right – good grades and obeying every stupid
order… I can’t be a Kirk in this house. Show me how to do that and I’ll
stay.</p>
<p><strong>the corvette blasts onto screen, fishtailing onto the
road,</strong>: young Jim Kirk behind the wheel . TIGHT ON JIM’S FACE as
he drives – having never done this before, he’s as nervous as he is
determined –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Son, you pull over that car!</p>
<p><strong>george jr.</strong>: – no… way.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: My name’s Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.</p>
<p>****: You say they are not yours…</p>
<p><strong>klingon guard</strong>: … these Federation maps we found in
your pockets.</p>
<p>****: I speak the truth. I do.</p>
<p><strong>klingon guard</strong>: Then who are they for?</p>
<p><strong>klingon guard</strong>: You would rather die then tell
us?</p>
<p>****: I have come far to meet you. “The One Who Does Not Speak.” Ten
years is a long time to maintain silence. Perhaps you simply do not
speak Klingon, just as I do not speak Romulan.</p>
<p><strong>klingon interrogator</strong>: But I assume we both speak the
language of our common enemy.</p>
<p>****: He reveals a worn LEATHER JOURNAL. Opens it, flips through it
almost casually… we see SKETCHES of the JELLYFISH SHIP, PAGES OF
COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS…</p>
<p><strong>klingon interrogator</strong>: We found this book in your
cell. Cartography, mathematics– what do these mean? This date here –
eleven years from now– what happens then?</p>
<p>****: And why attempt to smuggle in maps of Federation space?</p>
<p><strong>klingon interrogator</strong>: When you were captured we
assumed you were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil the Empire. But
because the Romulans deny your existence, I believe you are much more
than that.</p>
<p><strong>klingon interrogator</strong>: Your ship remains in orbit
above us now. We’ve been asking for its secrets for too long. That is
why I am here. We want to know how it works and I believe now, finally…
you will tell us.</p>
<p><strong>klingon interrogator</strong>: Centaurian slugs. Their native
planet is in constant sunlight. As a result, there’s nothing they hate
more… than darkness.</p>
<p><strong>klingon interrogator</strong>: They try to claw and bite
their way out of any dark space they’re in.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Spock, come here, let me see you.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Spock.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: There is no need to be so anxious. You’ll do
fine.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am hardly “anxious”, mother. And “fine” has
variable definitions. “Fine” is unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: May I ask a personal query?</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: … anything.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
discipline of Kolinahr… and purge all emotion… I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgement upon you.</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: As always… whoever you choose to be… you
will have a proud mother.</p>
<p><strong>science minister</strong>: You have surpassed the
expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With
one exception. I see you have applied to Starfleet as well.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It was logical to cultivate multiple
options.</p>
<p><strong>science minister</strong>: Logical but unnecessary. You are
hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the
more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It
is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your
disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If you would clarify, Minister– what
“disadvantage” are you referring to?</p>
<p><strong>science minister</strong>: … your human mother.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Council – ministers. I must decline.</p>
<p><strong>science minister</strong>: No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this academy.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Then as I am half-human, your record remains
untarnished.</p>
<p><strong>sarek spock</strong>: Spock. You have made a commitment to
honor the Vulcan At the moment, Father, I can way– think of no greater
way to</p>
<p><strong>science minister</strong>: Why did you come before this
council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I came with the intention of enrolling, as my
father wished. However, your “insight” has convinced me otherwise.
Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you,
Ministers, for your consideration. Live long and prosper.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Hi. I’d like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two
Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth beers, no slim-shots, anything on
draft.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s a lot of drinks for one woman. Wearing
those boots.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: And a shot of Jack, straight up.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Make it two – her shot’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Her shot’s on her. Thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Don’t you want my name before you completely
reject me?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I’m good without it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You are good without it. It’s Jim. Jim Kirk.
If you don’t tell me your name, I’m gonna have to make one up.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Uhura.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura? No way – that’s the name I was gonna
make up for you. Uhura what?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Just Uhura.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: They don’t have last names in your world?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Uhura is my last name.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: They don’t have first names in your world?
Wait, let me guess. Is it “Jim”?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Okay, so you’re a cadet. Studying. What’s your
focus?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don’t know
what that means.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
phonology, morphology, syntax– it means you’ve got a talented
tongue.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: And for a moment I thought you were just a
dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well. Not only.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: You think you’re smart.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh, baby, I’m the smartest.</p>
<p><strong>burly cadet</strong>: This guy bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Beyond belief, but nothing I can’t
handle.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You could handle me. That’s an invitation.</p>
<p><strong>burly cadet</strong>: Hey. You mind your manners.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke. Like your
hairline.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Hey – Jim: enough.</p>
<p><strong>burly cadet</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You heard me, Moon Beam.</p>
<p><strong>burly cadet</strong>: You know how to count farm boy? There’s
five of us… and one of you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Okay, so go get some more guys, come back and
it’ll be an even fight.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Enough! STOP!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Outside, all of you! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Y’alright, Son?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You can… whistle really loud, y’know that?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I couldn’t believe when the bartender told me
who you are.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … and who am I, Captain Pike?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Your father’s son. For my dissertation, I was
assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about your dad… he
didn’t believe in no-win scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He sure learned his lesson.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Depends on how you define winning. You’re
here, aren’t you? That instinct to leap without looking– that was his
nature, too. And in my opinion it’s something Starfleet has lost. We’re
admirable, respectable. But overly-disciplined. Those cadets you took
on, they’ll make competent officers – but you can bet your ass they’ll
run home to momma the minute they’re looking down the barrel of a
Klingon phaser cannon.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – why are you talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I looked up your file while you were drooling
on the floor. Your aptitude tests were off the charts– what is it, d’you
like being the only Genius Level repeat-offender in the midwest?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Maybe I love it.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: So your daddy dies… you can settle for a
less-than-ordinary life. Or do you feel like you’re meant for something
better? Something special?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Come to think of it, I do want to feel
special. You know what? I’m gonna go start a book club–</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Enlist in Starfleet.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enlist. You must be way down on your
recruiting quota for the month–</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: If you’re half the man your father was, Jim,
Starfleet could use you. You could be an officer in four years, have
your own ship in eight.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’re even, right? I can go.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new recruits
leaves tomorrow, 0800. Your father was Captain of a Starship. For twelve
minutes. I dare you to do better.</p>
<p><strong>shuttle pilot</strong>: Waiting for something, Cap?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: … No. Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Hold her a second…</p>
<p><strong>shipyard worker</strong>: Nice ride, man.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Live it up.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Four years? I’m gonna do it in three.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: At ease, Gentlemen. Never did get that first
name.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: And you never will.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Are you people deaf? I told you I don’t
need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!</p>
<p><strong>flight officer man</strong>: – you need to find a seat – – I
had one, in the bathroom, – Sir, for your own safety, – I suffer from
Aviaphobia, siddown, or I will MAKE you case you don’t understand big
sit down… do you hear me? words, it means ‘fear of dying RIGHT NOW. in
something that flies.’</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I might throw up on you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I think these things’re pretty safe–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t pander to me, kid: one tiny crack in the
hull and our blood boils in thirteen seconds – solar flare might crop
up, cook us in our seats – Hell, some of the damn passengers are blue.
And wait’ll you’re sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles, see
if you’re still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding– space is
disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet
operates in space.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah, well my ex-wife took the whole damn
planet in the divorce, I got nowhere to go but up. Leonard McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Jim Kirk– you really gonna throw up–?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Maybe–</p>
<p><strong>klingon guard #1</strong>: The day you’ve been waiting for is
upon us, Silent One. And look. No sign of salvation. No sign of change.
Just more pain.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: The wait is over.</p>
<p><strong>cadet uniforms</strong>: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across
campus, McCoy and Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco
beneath a blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk
struts:</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: So you’ll do it for me, right?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: I have no interest.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I didn’t ask if you have interest, I asked if
you’d do it.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: I’m about to ask you an obvious question: why
bother?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Because I’ve failed the test twice.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: And you’re determined to make it three. We’ve
all failed it– everyone has, and that’s the point! No one goes back for
seconds, let alone thirds – it’s not like you need to pass it to
graduate.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: So Bones: why do they make us take it?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: I told you to stop calling me that. You’re
very annoying.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And you’re the greatest – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: You’d better study for it this time.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh, no– Bones – I gotta date.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: A date? Listen, as smart as you are, which
ain’t much, if you don’t prepare–</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You have no idea how prepared I’m gonna be– no
idea.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Seriously, stop calling me Bones!
“Bones”.</p>
<p><strong>gaila</strong>: – oh Jim… Jim… Jim, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Yeah. I sent you a message.</p>
<p><strong>gaila</strong>: I say “I love you”, and you say “I sent you a
message?”</p>
<p><strong>kirk gaila</strong>: – but you can only open it tomorrow at
three o’clock on the dot – – what are you talking about? – Gaila,
promise me you’re not going to open it ’till – what is it? Tell me what
three – it says!</p>
<p><strong>gaila</strong>: You can’t get caught in this dorm– hide!
Under the bed, quick!</p>
<p><strong>gaila</strong>: Hey– I thought you were going to be in the
long-range sensor lab all night.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I was supposed to be, but it was crazy, I
picked up an emergency transmission from a Klingon prison planet – there
was an escape and a ship stolen from th– … you okay?</p>
<p><strong>gaila</strong>: Yeah, been running simulations all week, just
catching up on some rest. Tired. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Were you running simulations with the
mouth-breather hiding under the bed?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Your hearing is scary– you sure both your
parents are human?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: The hell are you doing with him in here?</p>
<p><strong>gaila jim</strong>: I can’t help it! I love him! Gaila loves
me–</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Get outta here – it’s my ass too if
administration catches you in this dorm.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You and I have a big day tomorrow –</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: You’re gonna fail.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If I pass, will you tell me your first
name?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: No. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I think the fact that you picked up a
transmission of a Klingon prison escape is very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: We have arrived at the coordinates you
requested. Stardate confirmed. 2258.5.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Standby.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: Captain… long range scans of Beta Quadrant
complete. Romulus is there. She’s there. We could go. Right now, go
home…</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Not yet – not like this. Not how we left. This
is our chance… to serve our people. We owe it to them – to do what no
other Romulan could ever do.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Welcome back. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: – we are receiving a distress signal from the
U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru. The ship has lost power and is stranded.
Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue
them… Captain.”</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral
Zone. And they are firing upon us.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: It’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yeah, don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>test administrator #1</strong>: Did he say “don’t worry about
it”?</p>
<p><strong>test administrator #2</strong>: – what’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Three more Klingon Warbirds decloaking – and
targeting our ship – I don’t suppose this is a problem either?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>weapons officer</strong>: They’re firing, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all
crew members from the damaged ship.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: And how do you expect us to rescue them when
we’re surrounded by Klingons?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Alert medical.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Our ship is being hit – shields at sixty
percent.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mmmm… no.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>test administrator #1</strong>: – the hell’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: – the Kobayashi Maru is still in distress…
but… the Klingons have stopped firing.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the Klingon
warbirds.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Jim, their shields are up.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Are they?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: … no.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Fire on all enemy ships – one photon each
should do – let’s not waste ammunition.</p>
<p><strong>weapons officer</strong>: Target lock acquired on all
warbirds – firing!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So. We’ve
eliminated all enemy ships, no one on board was injured and the
successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>test administrator #2</strong>: How the hell’d that kid beat
your test?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … I do not know.</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: James T. Kirk. Step forward.</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: An incident has occurred today
that concerns the entire student body. Academic immorality by one is an
assault on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of
conduct pursuant to regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code. Is there
anything you care to say before we begin?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yessir. I believe I have the right to face my
accuser directly.</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: Step forward please. This is
Commander Spock, one of our most distinguished graduates. He’s
programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed
to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby
changing the conditions of the test.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Your point being?</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: In academic vernacular, you
cheated.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Respectfully. Define “cheating”.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: To deceive by trickery.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Now let me ask you something I think we all
know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn’t it? You programmed it to
be unwinnable.</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: Mr. Kirk, I don’t see how the
intent of the exam is relevant to these proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Because if I’m right, Sir, then the test
itself is a cheat.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Your argument precludes the possibility of a
no-win scenario –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I don’t believe in no-win scenarios –</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Then not only have you violated the rules,
you’ve failed to understand the principle lesson.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Please, enlighten me.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk –
A captain cannot cheat death.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “I of all people?”</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had
assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How long did it take you to look that up?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: How long did it take you to program the virus
that allowed you to cheat?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Maybe you just don’t like that I beat your
test.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am Vulcan. “Like” is not a verb in our
vernacular. I’ve simply made the logical deduction that you’re a
liar.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What an idiot I am for taking that personally
–</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to
divine the purpose of the test.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Enlighten me again.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in
the face of certain death. To accept that fear and maintain command of
one’s self and one’s crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet
captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: So you’re telling me the point. Of the whole
thing. Is to be afraid?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Fear is necessary, yes.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no additional
training to control my narcissism when making command decisions.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You keep reminding me that you’re Vulcan. And
I’m sure you’re really proud of that, who wouldn’t be– but isn’t it true
you people don’t experience fear at all?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: And if that’s the case – What’s that say about
your ability to make command decisions?</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: We’ve received a distress call
from Vulcan. Cadet Kirk – you are on academic probation pending the
result of your hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle Hangar One immediately
– this hearing is at recess until further notice – dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Cheating isn’t winning.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who was that pointy-eared bastard?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: I don’t know, but I like him.</p>
<p><strong>male barracks leader female barracks officer</strong>: Blake!
U.S.S. Newton! Jaxa! The U.S.S. Endeavor! Counter! U.S.S. Odyssey!

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Excuse me, you didn’t call my name. Kirk,
James T..</p>
<p><strong>barracks leader</strong>: You’re on academic probation. That
means you’re grounded until the Academy Board rules.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: … Jim, the Board’ll rule in your favor. Most
likely. Look, Jim – I gotta go –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … yeah– yeah, you go… I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>stops</strong>: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk,
pulls him off:</p>
<p><strong>mccoy kirk</strong>: Come with me – – what’re you doing
–?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Commander, a word?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Was I not one of your top students?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Indeed you were –</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Did I not receive a Gold rating for
Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet first place over Kyoto and MIT at
the Oxford Invitational?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: An exceptional achievement, to be su–</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: – and did I not, on multiple occasions,
demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and, I quote, “unparalleled
ability to identify sonic anomalies” in subspace transmission
tests?!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Consistently, yes–</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: And while you were well aware that my
unqualified desire was to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned
to the Farragut.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of
favoritism.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: No. No. I am assigned to the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Oh. Yes, I believe you are.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Doing you a favor. I couldn’t just leave you
there, looking all pitiful– roll up your sleeve, I’m gonna give you a
vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas.</p>
<p><strong>kirk mccoy</strong>: Ow– what for? To give you symptoms. – I
don’t understand– – you’re gonna start to lose – yeah, I already have –
– don’t stand up yet –</p>
<p>****: – what’d you do to me? – you’re gonna get a really – this is a
favor?! – yeah, you’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>scanning officer</strong>: “Kirk, James T.” – he’s not
cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise –</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: But I am, and Medical Code states the
treatment and transport of a patient’s to be determined at the
discretion of his attending physician, which is me. You can see he’s
suffering, he needs me as his doctor, so since I’m assigned to this
ship, so’s he, or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the
Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its medical officers?</p>
<p><strong>scanning officer</strong>: … as you were.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: As you were.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I might throw up on you.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: You should look at this.</p>
<p><strong>of the flagship. the queen of the fleet is fully
constructed</strong>: AND READY FOR HER MAIDEN VOYAGE. The shuttle
glides to the underside of the Enterprise. A DOCKING BAY opens –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones. Thanks for getting me on board. But I
don’t feel right. I feel like I’m leaking.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Oh look, the pointy-eared bastard.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, engineering reports “ready for
launch”.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: The maiden voyage of our newest flagship
deserves more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today, but her
christening will have to be our reward for a safe return– All decks,
this is Captain Pike. Prepare for immediate departure. Helm,
thrusters.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock Control
reports ready – thrusters fired, separating from space dock –</p>

didn’t know you– I’m itching in my mouth, this is Here’s a short-lasting

<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Uh, he has lungworms, Sir? He’ll be fine but
couldn’t report to his post– I’m Hikaru Sulu –</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: – and you are a pilot, right?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Very much so, Sir– I’m not sure what’s… wrong
here…</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Is the parking brake on?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: – no, I’ll figure it out, just–</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Have you disengaged the External Inertial
Dampener?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Ready for warp, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: The external inertial dampener. That’s… the
parking brake.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: … yessir.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Vulcan isn’t experiencing a natural disaster,
it’s being attacked – by Romulans.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Cadet Kirk, I think you’ve had enough
attention for one day – Dr. McCoy, return to medical, we’ll have words
later.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>spock kirk</strong>: As you know, Mr. Kirk is not cleared to
be aboard this vessel. By Starfleet Yeah, I get it, you’re a
regulations, that makes him a great arguer, I’d love to do stowaway… it
again with you, too.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Fact: the same anomaly – a lighting storm in
space – that we saw today also occurred on the day of my birth, before a
Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin. You know that, I read your
dissertation. Which was good.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Fact: This ship – which had formidable and
advanced weaponry – was never seen or heard from again – fact: the
Kelvin attack took place on the edge of Klingon space and at 11-hundred
hours last night there was an escape from a Klingon prison planet – Rura
Penthe – fact: the escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and it was
reported that they stole a ship from the prison dock.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: And you know of this prison escape how?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Sir, I– I intercepted and translated the
message myself. Kirk’s report is accurate.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’re warping into a trap– there are Romulans
waiting for us, I promise you that.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The cadet’s logic is sound. And Lieutenant
Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her
conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Scan Vulcan space, check if any transmissions
are being made in Romulan.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Sir, I’m– not sure I could
distinguish the Romulan language from Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: How about you – you speak Romulan, Cadet…?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Uhura, Sir. All three dialects.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Uhura, relieve the Lieutenant – Mr. Hannity,
hail the U.S.S. Truman.</p>
<p><strong>hannity</strong>: The other ships are out of warp and have
arrived at Vulcan, Sir– but we seem to have lost all contact–</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, I pick up no Romulan transmissions –
or transmissions of any kind in the area. There seems to be something
jamming all communication around Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’s because they’re being attacked. Captain.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Shields up. Ready all weapons.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds! Four…
three… two–</p>
<p><strong>crew sees the narada floating above the planet – their eyes
go</strong>: WIDE AT THE MONUMENTAL SHIP – meanwhile, inside:</p>
<p><strong>romulan first officer</strong>: Sir, another Federation
ship!</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Destroy it, too.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, they’re locking torpedoes!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Full reverse, come about Starboard ninety
degrees! Drop us down underneath them! Prepare to fire all weapons!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Shields at thirty-two percent! Their weapons
are powerful, Sir, we can’t take another hit like that!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Get me Starfleet Command!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some
kind of high energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere– its signal
appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: All power to forward shields – prepare to fire
all weapons!</p>
<p><strong>romulan tactical officer</strong>: Fire torpedoes, take them
out–!</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: The hull – magnify –</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Divert auxiliary power from port nacelle to
the shields–!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, we’re being hailed!</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I am Captain Christopher Pike, to whom am I
speaking?</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: I am called Nero.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: You’ve declared war against the Federation.
Withdraw, and I’ll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership
at a neutral loca–</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart.
As does your Vulcan crew member… isn’t that right? Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Pardon me. But I don’t believe you and I are
acquainted.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: … no, we’re not. Not yet. I would like you to
see something. Spock. Captain Pike– your transporter capability is
disabled. You will man a shuttle and come aboard the Narada for
negotiations. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>kirk spock</strong>: – he’ll kill you, you know that– Your
survival is unlikely– – Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy– going
over to that – I, too, suggest you rethink ship is a mistake. this
strategy.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I understand that – I need officers who have
been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I have training, Sir!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Then come with me – Kirk, you too– you’re not
supposed to be here anyway. Radio the engine room, have Chief Engineer
Olsen meet us at Shuttle Bay Five.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Aye, Keptin.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Without transporters, we can’t beam off the
ship, can’t assist Vulcan, can’t do our job. I’m creating an
opportunity: Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will space-jump from the
shuttle. You’ll have chutes – you’ll land on that machine they’ve
lowered into the atmosphere that’s scrambling our gear– you’ll get
inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … okay.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Mr. Spock, I’m leaving you in command of the
ship. Once we have transport capability and communications back up,
you’ll contact Starfleet and report what the hell’s happening here.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Something you’ve got only precious few minutes
to figure out. If all else fails, fall back and rendezvous with the
fleet in the Laurentian System. Kirk. I’m promoting you to First
Officer.</p>
<p><strong>kirk spock</strong>: What!?! – Captain?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: While I’m gone we need to keep the chain of
command. And you two make a swell team.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain. Please. I apologize, but the
complexities of human pranks escape me.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: It’s not a prank, Spock. And I’m not the
Captain. You are.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Once we knock out that machine… Sir, what
happens to you?</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I guess you’ll have to come get me. Careful
with the ship. She’s brand new.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Suit up, Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Dr. Puri, report –</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: It’s McCoy– Dr. Puri was on Deck 6, he’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Aye, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: Kirk, Sulu, and the ship’s LEAD ENGINEER
OLSON are suiting up for the drop, strapping on sleek AIRDROP ARMOR.
WEB</p>
<p><strong>red shirt engineer</strong>: I am pumped to kick some Romulan
ass! No joke. BRING IT ON!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: So what kinda combat training d’you have?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Fencing.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … fencing.</p>
<p><strong>tethered: the source of the drill beam shooting into the
planet.</strong>: The shuttle GLIDES to a hover, 60,000 FEET ABOVE THE
DRILL –</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Pre-jump on one: Three, two, one.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Away team’s entering the atmosphere –</p>
<p><strong>toward the plasma drill – sulu pulls his chute first, then
kirk</strong>: – their chutes SNAP OPEN – JERKING THEM HARD UPWARD AS
THE RED</p>
<p><strong>but sulu isn’t so lucky</strong>: 20 yards from the drill
surface his chute gets SNARED IN THE CABLES, JERKING him upside down –
the WIND is so intense Sulu is BLOWN SIDEWAYS – his CHUTE LINES begin
RUBBING on the sharp metal of the suspension rig! Kirk holds on to one
of the chute’s cables – yells up:</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I’m Captain Christopher Pi–</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: So much for diplomacy.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: None of this is familiar– the interface, the
controls–</p>
<p><strong>kirk sulu</strong>: Step back– – what, you have an idea? –
yeahyeah, I do–</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: The jamming signal’s gone – communications
are re-established –</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Transporter control re-engaged –</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Chekov, run gravitational sensors – I want to
know what they’re doing to the planet.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Aye, Commander– Keptin, sorry. Keptin.</p>
<p><strong>romulan helmsman</strong>: The drill’s been sabotaged,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Launch the red matter. Now.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Kirk to Enterprise – they just launched
something toward the planet!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Keptin: gravitational sensors are off the
scale – if my calculations are correct, that pod they launched is
creating a singularity… that will consume the planet.</p>
<p><strong>spock’s stoic face. we get only a hint of the wild
emotions</strong>: STIRRING INSIDE HIM – Uhura watches Spock, heartsick
for him:</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They’re creating a black hole… at the center
of Vulcan?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: … yessir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: How long does the planet have?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: … minutes, Sir. I’d say minutes.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a
planetwide evacuation– all channels, all frequencies – maintain standard
orbit –</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: What? Spock, wait –</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: – where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: To evacuate the Vulcan High Council– they’re
tasked with protecting our cultural history. My parents will be among
them–</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: – you can’t beam them out?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It’s not possible – they’ll be in the Katrik
Arc, I must get them myself–</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Retract the drill, let’s move out!</p>
<p><strong>transporter chief</strong>: I’m trying! I can’t lock on your
signal!</p>
<p><strong>transporter chief</strong>: – you’re moving too fast!</p>
<p><strong>chevok</strong>: – no– I can do that– I CAN DO THAT!!!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: The black hole’s expanding, we won’t
reach minimum safe distance if we don’t leave immediately!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: – holdonholdonholdonholdon!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Compensating gravitational pull and–</p>
<p><strong>and rematerialize, slamming down on the transporter pads,
hard</strong>: AND PAINFUL, BUT SAFE! Transporter engineers GAPE in
utter amazement and relief – Chekov, sweating, laughs. Kirk and Sulu get
their bearings, peeling themselves up, at stunned whispers:</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: … thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … yeah, not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Step aside – I’m going to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The surface of what? YOU’RE GOING DOWN THERE?
Are you nuts?!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Energize –</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: Spock–!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The planet’s not safe, it has only seconds
left – we must evacuate now –</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Locking volume, transport in 5-4-3–</p>
<p><strong>faces – the belief that their planet – that they – are
going</strong>: TO DIE – and Spock, trying to hold it together – even
though their transport hasn’t yet begun – looks at Amanda – their eyes
lock – THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM – and in a surreal,
intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly:</p>
<p><strong>amanda</strong>: It’s okay. To be scared.</p>
<p><strong>by forever – as it fades away, evanescing like mist – on
spock</strong>: as it lands – Sarek too… a mother… a wife… has been
lost. And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without
anything to do or say… there’s no cheating death.</p>
<p><strong>unimaginable implosion – until nothing is there but
darkness.</strong>: And over this we HEAR:</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Acting Captain’s log. Stardate 2256.42: I
have assumed command of the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We’ve heard no word from Captain Pike. I have
therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as
Nero.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Nero, who has destroyed my home planet. And
most of its six billion inhabitants. I estimate no more than ten
thousand survived. While the essence of our culture has been saved, in
the elders who now reside upon this ship… I am now a member of an
endangered species.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: What can I do? Tell me what you need.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … I need…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I need for us all to continue performing
admirably.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hey. Listen, about what happened at Starfleet.
The test and everything– I know it looks like I was… using you, or
whatever. And I’m sorry. I really am. And… I just hope you’ll forgive
me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … you’re not Gaila, are you?</p>
<p><strong>not gaila</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero is
headed for Earth?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Their trajectory suggests no other
destination, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Earth may be his next stop, but we have to
assume every Federation planet’s a target.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Yes, agreed– but why didn’t they destroy
us?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Why waste a weapon? We weren’t a threat.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That’s not it. He said he wanted me to see
something. The destruction of my home planet.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: And how the hell did they do that by the way?
When did they jump so far ahead in the arms race?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The engineering comprehension necessary to
artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer: such technology
could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space
time.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Damnit, man, I’m a doctor, not a physicist –
are you suggesting they’re from the future?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That is what he’s suggesting and I don’t buy
it.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If you eliminate the impossible, whatever
remains – however improbable – must be the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: How poetic.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then what would an angry future Romulan want
with Captain Pike?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: As Admiral he knows details of Starfleet’s
defenses.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What we need to do is catch up to that ship.
Disable it, take it over and get Pike back.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Fantastic, I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain Pike left us with standing orders to
rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We’re technologically outmatched in every
way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: “Illogical”– you’re funny.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Not to mention we couldn’t do it anyway:
Nero’s ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – what about assigning Engineering crews to
try and boost our warp yield?</p>
<p><strong>spock kirk</strong>: Remaining power and crew are being used
to repair radiation leaks on the lower decks and damage to the main
deflector shield– without which we cannot communicate with – okay–okay,
okayokayokay– Starfleet. there’s gotta be SOME WAY!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We must gather with the rest of Starfleet to
balance the terms of our next engagement –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There won’t be a next engagement, Spock: by
the time we’ve “gathered”, it’ll be too late – how many planets are you
willing to risk? You say he’s from the future? Knows what’s gonna
happen? Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You’re assuming Nero knows how events are
predicted to unfold. The contrary: Nero’s very presence has altered the
flow of history, beginning with the attack on the U.S.S. Kelvin,
culminating in the events of today – thereby creating a new chain of
incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Does anyone understand him?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: … an alternate reality.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Precisely. Whatever lives we might have
lived, if the time continuum was disrupted… our destinies have changed.
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the Laurentian system, Warp Factor
Three–</p>
<p><strong>kirk spock</strong>: – wait– don’t do that – Spock – running
back to the rest of the fleet for a confab is a massive waste of time– –
These were the orders – He also ordered us to go Captain Pike issued
when he back and get him! Spock, left ship– you’re Captain now–! – I am
aware of my – Every second we waste, responsibilities, Mr. Kirk! Nero’s
getting closer to his next target–! – that is correct – and why – I will
not allow us to go that I alone am in command. backwards, away from the
problem, instead of hunting – then I must remove you from Nero down!
this ship. If I confine you</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yeah, don’t worry ab –</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: You are only the second human I have ever met,
face to face. You must have so many questions for me.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: I only have one for you. I need the subspace
frequencies of Starfleet’s border detection grids. Specifically those
surrounding Earth.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Christopher Pike – Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise,
registry NCC-1701.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Christopher. Answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: No. You answer for the genocide you just
committed on a peaceful planet–</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: I prevented genocide. Where I come from,
Christopher… this ship is just a mining vessel. I chose a life of honest
labor to provide for myself… and the wife who was carrying my child. I
sit here now… knowing you as enemies. Not just of today. But of
tomorrow. I watched as your Federation did nothing. They let us burn to
death… as our planet broke in half.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Then Nero, you’re confused. Romulus has not
been destroyed. How can you blame the Federation for something that
hasn’t happened–?</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: It did happen. I remember it. I… felt it. When
I lost her… I promised myself I would not speak another word until the
day of my retribution. In twenty five years I forgot the sound of my own
voice… but I didn’t forget the pain. That feeling cannot be erased.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: A feeling that every surviving Vulcan now
shares.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: If what you say is true… you can save Romulus.
You have a second chance to –</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: – yes, which is a gift I won’t waste on mercy.
My purpose, Christopher, is not simply to avoid the destruction of the
home I love… … but to create a Romulus which exists, free of the
Federation. Only then will she be saved.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Then we have nothing more to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: It’s not the fault of the human race that
Starfleet chose Earth as its center. You’re a more noble race than my
fallen cousins. I’ll take no pleasure in your extinction.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: How reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: The frequencies, please.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Christopher Pike – Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise,
registry NCC-1701.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Computer… where am I?</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Current location Delta Vega: Class
“M” Planet, unsafe. You have been ordered to remain in your pod until
retrieved by Starfleet authorities.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bite me, how’s that.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Lieutenant’s log, supplemental: I’m preparing
a testimonial for my Starfleet court martial assuming there’s still a
Starfleet left.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Acting Captain Spock – whose only form of
expression’s apparently limited to his left damn eyebrow – has marooned
me on Delta Vega in what I believe to be a violation of security
protocol 49.09, governing the treatment of prisoners aboard a st–</p>
<p><strong>kirk hauls ass as the thing comes after him – then suddenly
he</strong>: FALLS – DROPS – and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A
MASSIVE SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and ROARS
LOUDLY – until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature starts to FALL AS
WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense creature TUMBLING not far
behind!</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: The Hen-Gra. Notoriously afraid of heat.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hey… thank you…</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: … Jim?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – how d’you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: How did you find me–? Does Starfleet
know of my presence?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I have been… and always shall be… your
friend.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – no, I don’t know you – the only Vulcan I
know isn’t exactly a buddy.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: You are James T. Kirk. Your father is
George, as is your brother. Your mother’s name is Winona – you were born
in 2233 –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Stop. Please. I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: … I am Spock. One hundred and thirty
years senior to the Vulcan you know.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: It’s remarkably pleasing to see you
again. … especially after the events of today.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Old friend. Sir, I don’t have any idea how you
know what you know. But I don’t know you and if you are Spock we’re not
friends. You hate me. You marooned me here for mutiny…</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Mutiny? You are not the Captain?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’re the captain. Pike was taken
hostage.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: … by Nero.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What do you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: … he is a remarkably…</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: troubled Romulan. … Please. Allow me –
it will be easier–</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What’re you doing–?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Our minds… one and together…One hundred
and twenty-seven years from now everything ends.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: A star in Beta Quadrant will go
supernova – and like a cancer left untreated… it will grow… and destroy
everything.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I saw the beginning of it myself.
Vulcan Science Academy devised a plan to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: We built a ship containing a material
capable of generating the only thing powerful enough to consume a
supernova. A black hole.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I
would not return.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: My sacrifice, in service of all races,
seemed only logical.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Unfortunately… before I could begin the
mission… the supernova destroyed Romulus.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Nero’s planet was destroyed–</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed
Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which was hardly the case. Let me
continue.</p>
<p><strong>kirk spock prime</strong>: This annoys me, I don’t like – I
know, I know, I’m not it– do we have to do it like surprised to hear you
complain this–? – allow me to finish.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Nero came after me. Determined to
thwart my mission. If Romulus was allowed to die, he said… all planets
should share its fate.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I needed an exit. I knew if this
mission failed… everyone, everywhere… would lose everything.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I realized: a large black hole could
destroy the supernova. A smaller one… could be my escape. Could send me
back in time, allowing me to complete my mission. So I created a black
hole…</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Nero must have understood what I was
trying to do. Because he began racing for it.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Nero simply got to it first. How long I
was travelling… I couldn’t tell you. It was timeless. But when I
arrived…</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Nero was waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Forgive me… emotional transference is
an effect of the mind meld.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … so you do feel…</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: “Cthia” is the stricture that binds our
emotions… but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Going back in time… you changed all our
lives.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Yet remarkably, events within our
timelines, characteristics, people… seem to overlap significantly. Tell
me about the rest of the crew? Chekov– Uhura –?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Tactical and Communications –</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: – Sulu –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – he’s the helmsman, why?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here
is not a matter of coincidence… but rather, indication of a higher
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … he’d call it a damn miracle.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream’s
way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew
found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis – therein
lies our advantage. We must go– there’s a Starfleet outpost not far from
here.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Where you came from… did I know my father?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: … yes. You often spoke of him as your
inspiration for joining starfleet.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: You should know. He proudly lived to
see you become captain of the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Captain?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: A ship we must return you to as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Warp three. Course one-five-one mark three,
the Laurentian System.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, Doctor. I’m aware that James Kirk is a
friend of yours. Supporting me, as you did, must have been
difficult.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: … are you thanking me?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I’m simply acknowledging your
difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Permission to speak freely, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I welcome it.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Do you. Okay then: are you out of your Vulcan
mind? Were you doing the logical thing? Maybe. The right one? Debatable.
But one thing’s for damn sure – that kid doesn’t know how to lose. Just
isn’t in his DNA. Back home we have a saying: “If you’re gonna ride in
the Kentucky Derby, don’t leave your prize stallion in the stable.”</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a stallion
must first be broken before it can reach its potential.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: My God, Man… you could at least act like it
was a hard decision.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I intended to assist in the effort to re-
establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be
better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I’ll gladly defer to your
medical expertise.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … hello?!</p>
<p><strong>keenser</strong>: … can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Are you the station chief?</p>
<p><strong>keenser</strong>: … no. This way.</p>
<p><strong>starfleet officer</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>keenser</strong>: Visitors.</p>
<p><strong>starfleet officer</strong>: You realize how unacceptable this
is.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: … Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>starfleet officer</strong>: I’m sure it’s no’ your fault, and
I know youse lads are just doing your jobs, but could you no’ have come
a wee bit sooner?!</p>
<p><strong>starfleet officer</strong>: Six months I’ve been living on
nothing but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the promise of a real food
delivery! Six months, boys! It’s pretty clear what’s going on here,
isn’t it? Punishment! Ongoing! For something that was clearly an
accident!</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: You’re Montgomery Scott.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yes, that’s me – Scotty– you’re in the right
place– are there any other hard- working and equally-starving Starfleet
officers around?</p>
<p><strong>keenser</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You eat nothing. A bean and you’re done for
a week, I need food. And now you’re here – so. Thank you. Where is
it.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: You are in fact the Mr. Scott who
postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Yes! That’s exactly what I’m talking about!
How d’ya think I ended up here? I got into a debate with my instructor
on the issue of Relativistic Physics as they pertain to subspace travel…
He seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey,
was limited to a few hundred miles – so I told my instructor I could not
only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same
system – which is no big deal anyway – but if I were so inclined I could
actually do it with a lifeform! So I tested it on Admiral Archer’s prize
beagle. Which… was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I know that dog. What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I’ll tell ya when it reappears. Dunno. Feel
guilty.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: What if I told you your trans-warp
theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that
is travelling at warp speed. And that you only required the correct
field equation to recrystallize dilithium?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I haven’t been stationed here that long. If
such an equation had been discovered, I’da heard.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: The reason you haven’t heard of it,
Mr. Scott… is because you haven’t discovered it yet.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Y’from the future, are ya? Brilliant. D’they
still have sandwiches where you’re from? Piece and jam? Mince ’n
tatties? Cockaleekie soup?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>keenser</strong>: Food.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Allow us access to your shuttle… and I
will show you what a genius you actually are.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: She’s a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters are
totally banjaxed, along wi’ a few other things.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: … rapid. That’s impressive.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Your equation for achieving trans-warp
beaming.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Imagine that! Never occurred to me to think
of space as the part that’s moving.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Point of fact: it did occur to you.
Extrapolating Enterprise’s course –</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: – Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage already,
has it? Well, you must’ve done something right to be assigned to that
ship, Kiddo. She’s a well endowed lady – love to get my hands on her
ample nacelles, if you’ll pardon the engineering parlance.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Now’s your chance, Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Look, even if I believed you – where you’re
from, what I’ve done– which I don’t – we’re still talkin’ bout
slingshotting aboard while she’s going faster than light. Without a
proper receiving pad, that’s like tryin’a hit a bullet with a smaller
bullet, wearing a blindfold. On a horse.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I calculate no more than a four meter margin
of error.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: That’s all well and good unless you
rematerialize four meters outside the ship.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your
best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – you’re coming with us, right?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: No, Jim. My destiny lies along a
different path.</p>
<p><strong>kirk spock prime</strong>: Your destiny can wait – he won’t
believe me, only you can Under no circumstances can he explain w– be
made aware of my existence.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’re telling me I can’t tell you I’m
following your own orders? Why not? What happens?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the
one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of
your ship.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How, over your dead body?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Preferably not. There is, however,
Starfleet Regulation 619. Yes. I forget what little regard you had for
such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally
compromised by the mission at hand… must resign said command.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: So I need to emotionally compromise you?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Jim. I just lost my planet. I can tell
you. I am emotionally compromised. What you must do… is get me to show
it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let’s get
this over with. he Enterprise has a decent cafeteria I’m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You know… coming back in time… changing
history… that’s cheating.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: A trick I learned from an old
friend.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Live long, and prosper.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – no– shit!</p>
<p><strong>follows the length of tube – seeing where it’s heading – to
a</strong>: GIANT WATER TURBINE – essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING
BLENDER.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – no–nonono–</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: COMEONCOMEONCOMEON – like the simulator:
manual control enabled, pressure seal: enabled – shutdown–</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Turbine Shutdown Not Allowed.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Keptin, we’re detecting unauthorized access
to a water turbine control board!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Bring up video.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Security, this is the captain – seal
engineering deck and bring me the intruders in turbine station three –
set phasers to stun.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: – nice – – ship. Really.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – let’s get to the bridge–</p>
<p><strong>security officer #1</strong>: Come with me. Moon Beam.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Surprise.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He’s with me.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We’re travelling at warp – how did you manage
to get aboard this ship?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’re the genius, you figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: As Captain of this vessel I order you to
answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well I’m not telling. Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Does that frustrate you? My lack of
cooperation… does it make you angry?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You are not a member of this ship’s crew.
Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you
beamed ab –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – Don’t answer him.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You will answer me.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I’d rather not take sides.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Escort them to the Brig.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is it about you, Spock? Your planet was
just destroyed – your mother murdered – and you’re not even upset?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Your presumption that these experiences
interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate–</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: HA! And yet you said fear was necessary for
command. I mean – did you see that bastard’s ship? Did you see what he
did?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yes, of course I–</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: So are you afraid or aren’t you?!?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I will not… allow you to lecture me about the
merits of emotion.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then why don’t you stop me.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is it like? Not to feel? Anger. Or
heartbreak. Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the
woman who gave birth to you?!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: – back away –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You must not feel anything! It must not even
compute for you! You must not have loved her at all–!</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: Spock!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby
relinquish my command on the grounds that I have been… emotionally
compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship’s log.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I like this ship. It’s exciting.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Congratulations, Jim. Now we’ve got no
Captain and no first officer to goddamn replace him.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yeah we do.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thanks for the support!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I sure hope you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … so do I. Attention crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Spock has resigned commission and advanced
me to acting Captain. I know you were all expecting to regroup with the
fleet, but I’ve ordered a pursuit course of the enemy ship to Earth.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I want all departments at battle stations and
ready in ten minutes. Either we’re going down, or they are. Kirk
out.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I want some answers.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Right now. Where the hell’d you get
trans-warp technology?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: – yeah, you know that’s complicated –</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Do I look simple to you?!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I’m a PhD in astrophysics, I think I can
handle it – how’d you get back?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: You vant us to trust you but you von’t tell
us the truth?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No. No, I won’t– hey, I’m the Captain now! I
don’t have to tell you anything! Now listen: we need to figure out a way
to catch up and get to Nero’s ship.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: There’s not a chance. They’re gonna be in
geosynchronous orbit around Earth in ten minutes. We’ll never make
it.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Even if we could, you can’t go in guns
blazing, not with their technology, that’s suicide.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then we find a way to get on that ship and
steal the black hole device away from them.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Well you can forget transwarp. No way to
predict the Narada’s position from here.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura: anything from Captain Pike?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: No… I’ve been monitoring all channels.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: You must not punish yourself. Speak your
mind, Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That would be unwise.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: What is necessary is always wise.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a
child. Have I made so little progress?</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: You will always be a child of two worlds. I
am grateful for that. And for you. And not only because you are all I
have left of her.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I feel anger. For the one who took her life.
An anger I cannot stop.</p>
<p><strong>sarek</strong>: I believe she would say… do not try to. You
asked me once. Why I married your mother. I married her because I loved
her.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Keptin Kirk? Excuse me, plees, could</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes, Chekov– you don’t need to ask permission
to–</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Based on the Narada’s course from Vulcan,
I’ve projected that Nero will travel past Saturn. If we could drop out
of warp behind one of Saturn’s moons, say, Titan, the magnetic
distortion from the planet’s rings will make us invisible to Nero’s
sensors. We could follow him to Earth by staying in his blind spot.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What blind spot?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our shield
frequencies, they shouldn’t detect us.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Wait a minute– anyone understand this kid?
How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: We’re all old enough to shave here.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Doctor… Mr. Chekov is correct.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr. Sulu
can maneuver us into position, I can beam aboard Nero’s ship.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I won’t order you to do that, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry.
Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their
ship’s computer to locate the device.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Also, my mother was human. Which makes Earth
the only home I have left.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I would cite regulation, but I know you will
simply ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: See, we’re getting to know each other.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: The men and I have discussed this. What we are
about to do. We have to turn the ship around. We can save our home.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>ayel</strong>: We can go back. That’s what we want. We have
taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No more. We want to go home now.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: There is no need, Ayel. To threaten me. I
understand.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: I understand. But you are wrong.</p>
<p><strong>eyes go wide – nero thrusts the blades into ayel – who
falls</strong>: TO THE FLOOR, DEAD! Nero’s hard face turns to the rest
of his crew.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: We will return to Romulus when the Federation
lies in ruins and not a moment before. When those who watched our people
burn at last understand our pain, our loss. I refuse to return as a
slave! We will return as conquerors!</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Deploy the drill.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Mr. Chekov, transfer manual control to the
Captain’s chair.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Aye. I’ve projected the parabolic course you
must follow. If you deviate by so much as a meter, we will be
detected.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Give me one quarter impulse burst for five
seconds and I’ll do the rest with thrusters. On my mark. Three… two…
one… fire.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: All stop in three… two… one…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Transporter Room. We’re in stable
geosynchronous orbit behind the Narada.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: No sign they’ve detected us –</p>
<p><strong>belts</strong>: COM-SETS, TRICORDERS, and of course, PHASERS
–</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Well done, Mr. Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel you
have a tactical advantage fire on that ship. Even if we’re still aboard.
It’s an order.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Yessir. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: We’ll be monitoring your frequency…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Thank you, Nyota.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Her first name is…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have no comment on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: If there’s any common sense to their ship
design, I’ll be puttin’ ya in a cargo bay, shouldn’t be a soul in
sight.</p>
<p><strong>facing the same direction for the first time – an iconic
image -</strong>: - The moment of truth.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Energize.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mine had a gun.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of
Suus Mahna.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am unable to meld with these Romulans –
there are subtle differences in their physiology I did not anticipate
–</p>
<p><strong>kirk spock</strong>: – punch him in the face – make him talk!
Suus Mahna his – Suss Mahna is only intended ass! for self-defense, he’s
no – then pretend it’s a threat - - I’m your captain, that’s an
order!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: What is your computer access code?</p>
<p><strong>romulan helmsman</strong>: The plasma drill is repaired and
fully deployed.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Good. Let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: They’ve activated the drill –</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Communications and transporter inoperative
–</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: They’re on their own now.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: What you refer to as the “Red Matter Device”
is in the main hangar – and I’ve located Captain Pike.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Unknown.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, you’ll be piloting the ship alone.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Which may be problematic, as I am unfamiliar
with this ship’s design.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Wow. That’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Computer: what is your manufacturing
origin?</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Stardate 2397, commissioned by the
Vulcan Science Academy.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It appears you’ve been keeping rather
important information from me.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Just trust me. Can ya do that?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’ll get Pike.</p>
<p><strong>blowing it open! debris and loose objects get sucked into
space</strong>: as –</p>
<p><strong>romulan helmsman</strong>: Primary core rupture, warp engines
off- line!</p>
<p><strong>romulan tactical officer</strong>: Someone has detonated
weapons in the main hangar!</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Restore power! Engage auxiliary systems!</p>
<p><strong>romulan tactical officer</strong>: The drill’s been
severed!</p>
<p><strong>romulan commander</strong>: Ambassador Spock’s ship has been
stolen as is heading out of the solar system!</p>
<p><strong>romulan commander</strong>: … Spock.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Open a channel –</p>
<p><strong>romulan communications officer</strong>: Channel Open –</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Spock – I should’ve killed you when I had the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Under authority granted me by the Europa
convention, I’m confiscating this illegally obtained ship and order you
to surrender your vessel. No terms. No deals.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: You can’t cheat me again, Spock. I know you
better than you know yourself.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Last warning: unconditional surrender or you
will be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Fire at will.</p>
<p><strong>romulan commander</strong>: Sir– if you ignite the red
matter, the–</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: I want Spock dead! Fire!</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: … Kirk?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Came back, Sir. Just like you ordered.</p>
<p><strong>nero on comms</strong>: … you should’ve fled, Spock. Sight
target, standby torpedoes… FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Warning: Shields off-line.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Computer, prepare self destruct sequence.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Nice timing, Lieutenant –</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Never beamed two targets from two places
onto the same pad before! That was pretty good!</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: – we’re gonna need gastric stimulators, let’s
prep him for surgery, now!</p>
<p><strong>romulan communications officer</strong>: Nero– it’s the
Enterprise!</p>
<p><strong>whoosh</strong>: KIRK and SPOCK race back onto the bridge
–</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Keptin! The enemy ship is losing power– its
shields are down!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Hail them – now!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the U.S.S.
Enterprise – your ship is compromised – too close to the singularity to
survive without assistance – which we are willing to provide.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain – what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We show them compassion– it may be the only
way to earn peace with Romulus. It’s logic, Spock! I thought you’d like
that.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: No, not really, not this time.</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: I would rather suffer the death of Romulus a
thousand times than accept assistance from you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You got it. Lock phasers! Fire everything
we’ve got!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Kirk to Engineering: get us out of here,
Scotty!</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: – you bet yer ass, Captain –</p>
<p><strong>nero</strong>: Forgive me… Romulus…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Father…?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I am not… our father.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: There are so few Vulcans left. We
cannot afford to ignore each other.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you
alone could’ve explained the truth?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Because you needed each other. Opposing
yet complimentary opposites. It was that balance between us – I should
say you and Kirk – that often made the impossible, possible.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … it was a test?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I’m in no position to pass judgment… my
actions have robbed you of much. I could not also deprive you the
revelation of all you can accomplish together… of a friendship that will
define you both in ways you cannot yet realize.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: How did you persuade him to keep your
secret?</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
would ensue should he break his promise.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You lied.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I implied.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: A gamble…</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: An act of faith. One I hope you’ll
repeat in the future.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The future’s not what it used to be… in the
face of extinction, it’s only logical I resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: And yet, you are in a unique position…
you can be in two places at once.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I’ve
already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony,
and assist in the foundation of a new science academy.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: My future cannot be determined by your past.
We are one, but not the same.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Then I ask that you do yourself a
favor. Put away logic. Do what feels right. The world you’ve inherited
lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation… but there’s no reason
you must face it alone.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: As my customary farewell would appear
oddly self serving, I will simply say… good luck.</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: This assembly calls Captain James
Tiberius Kirk…</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: Your inspirational valor and
supreme dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest
traditions of service and reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew,
and the Federation. For your… unique solution to the Kobayashi Maru,
it’s my honor to award you with a commendation for original
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>academy president</strong>: By Starfleet Order 28455, you are
hereby directed to report to Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise, for
duty as his relief.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I relieve you, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines at
your command, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Weapons systems and shields on standby.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Dock control reports ready. Yard Command
signalling clear.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Scotty how are we?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Dilithium chamber at maximum efficiency,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>mccoy</strong>: Same ship, different day.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus–</p>
<p><strong>whoosh</strong>: the turbolift door opens. SPOCK!!! Wearing
his BLUE UNIFORM. Our hearts soar –</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Permission to come aboard, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … Permission granted.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: As you have yet to select a first officer,
respectfully, I would like to submit my candidacy. Should you desire, I
can provide character references.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It would be my honor, Commander. Maneuvering
thrusters, Mr. Sulu. Take us out.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Aye, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>spock/nimoy</strong>: Space… the final frontier. These are
the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission…
to explore strange new worlds… to seek out new life forms, and new
civilizations… To boldly go, where no one has gone… before…</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: … oh my God… A lightning storm… then
this… Signal all departments: first contact protocols. Looks like we
have someone new on the block. All Stop.</p>

<p><strong>kelvin crew member comms</strong>: Broadcasting universal
greeting on all open frequencies.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Sir, should we initiate an active
scan?</p>
<p><strong>captain robau</strong>: That could be seen as an act of
provocation – all readings passive–</p>
<p><strong>kelvin crew member</strong>: EM sensors in passive sweep…</p>
<p><strong>kelvin crew member</strong>: Power signature detected –
level’s increasing.</p>
<p><strong>officer pitts captain robau</strong>: Sir, I have a reading –
they’ve locked weapons on us! – Red alert! Arm weapons!</p>
<p><strong>first officer captain robau</strong>: Torpedo locked on us at
320 degrees, mark two – incoming – Evasive pattern Delta-5! fast!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Redirecting auxiliary power to forward

<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never
seen anything like it! Weapons off-line! Main power at 38 percent!</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: Then I ask that you do yourself a
favor… put away logic, and do what feels right. The world you’ve
inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation… but there’s
no reason you must face it alone.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: This was a gift to me. Representing… a
dream. One we were unable to fulfill. The way you can now.</p>
<p><strong>spock prime</strong>: As my customary farewell would appear
oddly self serving, I will simply say… good luck.</p>
<p><strong>kirk/ shatner</strong>: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday
to you… I know I know, it’s illogical to celebrate something you had
nothing to do with, but I haven’t had the chance to congratulate you on
your appointment to the ambassadorship so I thought I’d seize the
occasion… Bravo, Spock – they tell me your first mission may take you
away for awhile, so I’ll be the first to wish you luck… and to say… I
miss you, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>kirk/shatner</strong>: I suppose I’d always imagined us…
outgrowing Starfleet together. Watching life swing us into our Emeritus
years…</p>
<p><strong>kirk/shatner</strong>: I look around at the new cadets now
and can’t help thinking… has it really been so long? Wasn’t it only
yesterday we stepped onto the Enterprise as boys? That I had to prove to
the crew I deserved command… and their respect?</p>
<p><strong>commandant</strong>: This assembly calls Captain James
Tiberius Kirk…</p>
<p><strong>commandant</strong>: Your inspirational valor and supreme
dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions
of service and reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew, and the
Federation. By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby directed to report
to Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I relieve you, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: … I am relieved.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: And as Fleet Admiral, for your… unique
solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it’s my honor to award you with a
commendation for original thinking.</p>
<p><strong>pike</strong>: Congratulations, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: … Same ship, different day.</p>
<p><strong>kirk/shatner</strong>: I know what you’d say – `It’s their
turn now, Jim…’ And of course you’re right… but it got me thinking:</p>
<p><strong>kirk/shatner</strong>: Who’s to say we can’t go one more
round? By the last tally, only twenty five percent of the galaxy’s been
chartered… I’d call that negligent. Criminal even – an invitation.</p>
<p><strong>kirk/shatner</strong>: You once said being a starship captain
was my first, best destiny… if that’s true, then yours is to be by my
side. If there’s any true logic to the universe… we’ll end up on that
bridge again someday.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the
journey itself… is home.</p>
