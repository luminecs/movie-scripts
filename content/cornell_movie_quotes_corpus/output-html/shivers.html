<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Morning, folks. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>kresimir</strong>: Yes, please. I… er, we… are looking for
the rental agent here. We have an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: OK, I’ll just give him a little buzz and
he’ll come out and show you the way in.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Darned thing.</p>
<p><strong>benda</strong>: Do you ever use that?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: This? No, never even had it out of the
holster. A rival company has ’em, so we gotta have ’em. Just an
advertising gimmick.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Here’s Mr. Merrick. He’ll take you on
in.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Welcome to Starliner Towers. And you
are…?</p>
<p><strong>kresimir</strong>: Kresimir and Benda Sviben.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Eh? Oh yes, of course. Mr. and Mrs. Sweden.
Come right this way. Sorry to keep you waiting. Now, are we talking
about one or two bedrooms? I assume we’re not talking about bachelors,
eh? Ha, ha. Now, I have several floor plans all laid out for you, and
all you have to do is take your choice and we’ll trot right on up there
and take a look at ’em…</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Now you take a look at that one, Brenda,
and tell me if it doesn’t suit you down to the ground. That one has the
big view, the panoramic view…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Breakfast is just about ready, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Can I call you at the office?</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: What do you want to call me at the office
for?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I don’t know. I just thought I might want to
call you. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: I won’t be at the office except to sign in.
I’ve got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and
more garages. I’ll come home right after work.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: We’re going up.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Oh. Well, I’ll go along for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: the Svibens, indicating the</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Notice how the entranceways to all the
apartments are recessed and individually lit… Nope, it’s down that way,
Brenda. That’s it… Recessed and individually lit…</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Like I said to the police officer, he paid
the rent, Dr. Hobbes did. And he came around and chatted a lot with
everyone here, the staff, I mean. Nice guy. Not a high and mighty type.
But it was her name on the residency list and the buzzer board:
Annabelle… what was it again?… Annabelle Horsefield. She never
complained about anything, not to me, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Annabelle’s corpse, which is just
being</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Far as I know, yeah, that was her.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Is that the man who called you up
here?</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Yeah, that’s Dr. St. Luc. He’s the head of
our little medical clinic here.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Medical clinic?</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too
long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or
somebody complains.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Well, let’s go talk to your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller.
I’d like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: by what he has been</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You’re the one who found the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Did you touch anything? Move anything
before we got here?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You knew these people?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a
professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn’t
know her. She never came to the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: So you just came up to visit this Hobbes
and you found them like that?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Oh, no. I haven’t seen Dr. Hobbes since I
was in medical school. He taught me… he was my prof in urology and… I
think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I
had no idea he’d ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I see. Then what brought you up here?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: It was very strange. He called me at six
this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven’t
heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said
something like, ‘Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out
for lunch with me. It’s time you furthered your education.’ Then he
laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight
to remind me to come.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: How did he sound this time? Was he
nervous? Depressed?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: He sounded fine.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Who? No, that’s not me. You got the wrong
guy. Just a sec. It’s for you. Somebody wants to know how come you
didn’t show up for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would
have laid on you, Rog, but it’s all I got, and… …all I got I share with
you. Go ahead. Take all you want.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: You touch my spleen, Rollo. And here all
the time I was thinking – if I ever bothered to think about the good old
days – well, at least there’s Rollo. He’s in VD and he’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: I’m still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You
know me. I’m a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Well, at least you still talk the same.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: So who changes?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: But you gave up your private practice.
Suddenly you’re into pure research and you… you’re what, a
parasitologist?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: That was my father’s idea… private practice.
He wanted to set me up – I couldn’t say no. But he’s dead now. And me,
I’m still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff…
…lookit it!</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: indicating the entire</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: The note includes a warning against
swallowing the tongue whole, but we don’t see the rest of this caution.
‘Satyr’s Tongue’ was Hobbes’s code name for our project. What we were
trying to do was to find an alternative to organ transplants.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: I know. You’re bored already. Transplants are
yesterday’s kishkas, right?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Did I say anything?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: specimens of parasites and diseased
organs</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: You put the bug into the body of a man with a
diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it’s
assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where
you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you’re gonna say. You’re
gonna say it’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: It’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Right. It’s crazy. But here’s the beauty
part. Ready? Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy
teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was
always a genius at one thing – getting grants. Could he get grants for
crazy projects?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: You know who pays the rent here? Eh? The
Northern Hemisphere Organ Transplant Society. And that’s for something
that’s supposed to put them outta business. And they’re not the only
ones. We got grant money coming out of our ears.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: See? There? You take a little of this… that’s
a very rare venereal disease you get in the nomadic Crinua people,
Northeast Asia and Japan. Oo. That one’s got it bad. They call it
Batinh. That means ‘kiss’ or ‘caress.’ When you get it it makes your
lips itchy, ya wanta kiss everything. I even had it once. I always get
everything at least once so I know what the patient’s talking about. And
there… you take a little of that… that’s beautiful, isn’t it? That’s
Flexipes, the world’s only cephalopod parasite. That’s him right there.
Not a very good specimen. Related to squids and octopuses. See? He lives
in the guts of whales and big dolphins. Ya like ’em big ’n hot ’n wet,
don’t ya? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: We don’t do it all here, we send out to have
tricky stuff done… the cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal fission,
all that fancy close work.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Rollo, how come Hobbes killed himself?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Funny in the head. High suicide rate in the
medical profession. Too much body, alla time bodies, bodies.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really.
Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell
the honest-to-God truth, I’m lonely. All Hobbes ever did was run around
getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in
anyway. That’s why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would
have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with
inflation.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: being put on the</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: You want to help sick people for the rest of
your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: You oughta be careful yourself. Might end
up cutting your throat.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn’t
handle them. That girl, that Annabelle – talk about crazy projects.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Who was she?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some
private girls’ school. They caught him examining her little tits for
breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don’t ask. It was
craziness, believe me. They used to come here sometimes. Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: I’ll never really understand how he could do
what he did to her.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Well, Rollo Linsky… I gotta go open up the
store. It’s been great to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: But you’ll think about what I said about
working together, huh?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK. I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You say something?</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands.
That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You sure you’re OK, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: …probably nothing at all. It’s probably just
a bunch of, I don’t know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a
doctor’s office. Has Nick seen a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He
never goes to doctors.</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: Well, look. How’s this? You go on down to the
clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc… …you tell him that Nick’s ill,
he’s got these lumps, and he can’t get out of bed. Tell him to come when
you’re sure Nick’ll be home. And don’t tell Nick anything. Let the two
of them fight it out.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: He’ll be really mad.</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: So? You’ll find out what’s wrong and then
you’ll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a
change.</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven’t seen you here
before, have I?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: Ashen &amp; Gaunt, Insurance
Appraisals. Mr. Tudor? One moment, please. I’ll buzz him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: I’m sorry to keep you waiting. I’ll
put you on ‘hold’ again and see if I can find Mr. Tudor.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: Nicholas? There’s a call for you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: Nicholas? It’s that man whose
Lamborghini caught fire on St. Catherine Street and burned to the
ground. He’s very angry…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: Nicholas! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: We’re going to get you to a hospital.
That’s what we’re going to do.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: No, no. I’ll be all right. I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: Do you see this? This is blood. It
came from your insides. That means it’s serious. Probably an ulcer. You
executives are all the same.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: back from Tudor’s forehead in a
very</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: away from Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: Nicholas, I think…</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: I don’t care what you think. Please call me a
cab. Now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheatley</strong>: All right, Nicholas. All right.</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: …and this Kriedler seems to think that
mega-vitamin therapy may be the answer to the question of aging. That’s
not to suggest that the aging process is in any way reversible – I don’t
think for a minute that it is – but it may be stoppable, and that’s
where mega-vitamins come in…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Excuse me, Brad. Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Afternoon, Mr. Tudor.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Well, there’s certainly nothing here in
this check-up I did for your husband’s company last year. Blood pressure
a touch high, cholesterol count nice and low… I just can’t see cancer
developing that fast, Janine, not the way you’ve described it. Could be
swollen glands or something, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You’ll come up and take a look at him?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: If he can’t make it down here… sure. That’s
what I’m here for. But it won’t be until, oh… …9.30, say 10.00. OK? Not
too late?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: That’s great, Doctor. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Mrs. Ementhal’s ready and waiting,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: I’m ready for you now, Brad.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Now, you just take off all your clothes,
put this on, and hop up on to the table over there, OK? Doctor’ll be in
to see you in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: You don’t have to go. I’m not shy.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Don’t be a tease, Brad. I’m still working,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: Aw. Poor birdie. They’re always crashing
into tall buildings. It’s such a shame, such a shame. The windows fool
them, you know.</p>
<p><strong>companion</strong>: Come along, Olive.</p>
<p><strong>first lady</strong>: Oh, Vi! Maybe the poor thing’s just been
hurt. Maybe we should look for him!</p>
<p><strong>companion</strong>: Don’t be silly, dear. It’s in heaven now,
whatever it is. Won’t help at all for you to get into a fuss and muddle
over it. Now come along and let’s finish up our little evening stroll
and get you tucked up in bed in front of the color TV.</p>
<p><strong>companion</strong>: You know what a restless night you have
if you don’t get your two hours of color TV, dear, so let’s bustle along
and get our walk over with, shall we…?</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: Ow! Better take it easy. There’s a lot of
pressure in there!</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: Want me to breathe deeply?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Just breathe normally.</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: Good shape for an old man, eh?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you
caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: She had a couple just like them. Right here
near her belly button. You could push ’em around. I thought they were
kinda sexy, myself.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Didn’t she ever have these lumps looked at
by a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: Didn’t seem worried about them.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Was this girl from Starliner Towers?</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went
to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed. She was gone when I got
back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan. Must have
gone home to mother.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK, you can get dressed now,
Mr. Parkins.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: I’m going to send you to the hospital to
have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you’re hiding
in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under
Radiology.</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: Gonna cut me open?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Well, let’s wait for the X-rays.</p>
<p><strong>parkins</strong>: Used to know a doctor who said he got to
know his patients better than their wives did. Cutting a man open sure
does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit
that.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: Hi. Want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that
Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: Was he nice to you?</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: Good. Well… I’ve ordered in some vrai cuisine
fran�aise from Jean-Phillipe at the C�te d’Azur restaurant. Escargots in
garlic butter… the works. They have lovely strong delivery boys who
fight their way through sleet and hail and the gloom of night just to
bring me my coq au vin. And after Dr. St. Luc has told you that there’s
nothing wrong with Nick that a vacation won’t cure, and if Nick falls
asleep early again, you just come on back here for company and a late
supper. You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: Now, I mean it. I always order enough for two
and I’ll just get fat and lonely if you don’t show up.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: C’mon, let’s smoke one of the cigarettes right
now. Your father’ll never miss it.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I can’t, dummy. He’ll see that the pack’s been
opened. You’re such a dumbhead.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: OK, then. I’m gonna go back to the store and
buy my own pack and smoke ’em all myself.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Buy ’em with what, dumbhead?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up
on the way home.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I dunno. Guess the milk went bad. It’s still
worth money.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Let’s get outta here before somebody hears
us!</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Come here, boy. Here, boy, here.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and me, we’re
gonna be friends, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: No, no, no. Don’t run away, boy. I’m not
going to hurt you. Not going to hurt you. We’re going to be friends.
Friends.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Attaboy. Attaboy.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Nick? I didn’t know you were home. What’s
wrong? What are you doing? You’re almost falling out of bed. How are you
feeling?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: caution, as though</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Go away. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, why won’t you let me help you?</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Attaboy, attaboy.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK, Dotty. Everything else seems to be
fine. Now if it gives you any trouble at all, any sharp pain, any
unusual discharge, you come and see me right away. They can be tricky
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: OK, Roger. Here’s the stuff you wanted.
Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published
by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of
the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American
Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends
from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought
they might interest you.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: That’s great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Do I get a kiss?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Kiss, kiss?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Uh, OK. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Another kiss?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: C’mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the
list?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: No. Dotty’s the last.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: That you, Rog?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: It’s me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Rollo! How’sa boy? I was just thinking
about you.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Been glancing at some of your publications
on your work with Hobbes.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m flattered, but you won’t find
any real meat in them.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: No? How come?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you
know? I told you that. But I didn’t really know just how funny he was.
See… when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they
found to his mother – she’s still alive but just barely – and she sent
everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I’m Hobbes’s
partner, right? Anyway, I’ve been going through his papers, and what
they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university,
the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never
really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few
crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look
like.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK, I bite. What does it look like?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: It looks like – and I quote – ‘a disease to
save man from his mind.’</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Lemme clarify for you.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Hobbes thought that man is an animal that
thinks too much, an animal that has lost touch with his instinct, his
‘primal self’… in other words, too much brain and not enough guts. And
what he came up with to help our guts along was a human parasite that
is… lemme find it here… ‘a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal
disease, a modern version of the satyr’s tongue.’</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: But the important thing for you is this:
Hobbes used Annabelle as a guinea pig. He implanted her with the thing.
I figure that once the parasites took, Annabelle went berserk. I dunno
what she did, but Hobbes wasn’t ready for it. He had to kill her. And he
wasn’t trying to burn her, he was burning them, all of them.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: He didn’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Maybe Hobbes didn’t know it, but Annabelle
was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I’ve got three men
here, maybe four, who’re hosting large, free-moving, apparently
pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I’ve tried can identify. You
were next on my list.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: I’d kinda like to come over there and have a
look at one of these guys.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: I’ve got a date with one of them at ten.
Can you make it?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Yeah. Ah, I don’t want to panic you or
anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they’re supposed to
get out of hand real quick, so you don’t have much time to think about
what’s happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those
dynamite juices into the old blood stream… I dunno. But if you see some
people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things…</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: take this aspect too</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get
at them, there’s a lotta stuff you can use. I’ll bring a bagful. It’s
just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK. It’s apartment 1009, South Tower,
Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: OK, Rog. See you at ten.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Roger? If you’re going to be staying here
anyway, why don’t you come up to my place for a late supper?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Meeting Rollo at Tudor’s. Might take a
while.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Doesn’t matter to me how late it is. I can
keep it warm.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Well? Supper at my place?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK. But late.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: knows she can get</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I’m hungry!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I’m hungry!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Hungry for love. Hungry for love.</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: Lovely, lovely evening. Very quiet,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. spergazzi</strong>: Eh, the children in this apartment,
they’re such little thieves. You have to put a lock on everything.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Can I… can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>kresimir</strong>: Yes… you can… help me.</p>
<p><strong>kresimir</strong>: Oh, my darling, I worship, I worship at
the shrine of your body, your body, your body, oh, your body…</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Forsythe, Forsythe! What’s wrong? What’s
happened?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: A man… I think I recognized him… a man who
lives here. He just… …he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just
opened the door… I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he
tried to kiss me…</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Where is he now? Do you know?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: I think I… I think I killed him. I stabbed
him with something and he fell.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Will you be OK now? I’ve got to go to your
place to see if he’s still there. I’ve got to see if it’s… if it’s what
we both think it is.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Oh, no! You’re not leaving me here all
alone. I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Here, here. What is this all about? What’s
the matter with you? What are you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Hey, that’s enough, enough of this
nonsense! What is this?</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: Hey, Doctor, Doctor! Please. Help
us!</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: he introduces himself even in the
midst of</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: It’s all right, cara mia. What’s one
more scar to an old lady, eh? You’ll be OK.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Where is this thing that attacked your
wife?</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then
I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to
the garbage.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: This is Nurse Forsythe. She’s a nurse, you
understand me?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Go back to their apartment with them and
treat her for second-degree burns. It’ll have to do for now. What’s your
number? The number of your apartment?</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: We live in 703.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: OK. I’ll meet you back there. Don’t leave
until I get there. Lock the door and don’t open it except for me.
OK?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: But where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Down to the incinerator.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Janine. Janine. Come here. Come into the
bedroom, Janine.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Nick? Are you up? I can’t see a thing, I
took my contacts out.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Hello, darling. I feel wonderful. Come and
sit beside me, beside me on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Do you want to make love? You’re absolutely
beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You’re absolutely the most sexy
thing alive. Do you want to make love?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Nick, you’re so strange…</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: You will make love to me, won’t you, Janine?
Won’t you make love to me? You start it. Won’t you? I think I’ve
forgotten how to start.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, Nick, Nick… I can’t take this.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease,
Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine…</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Love me. Oh, Janine, you’re so beautiful.
You’re my wife. Mmm. You’re my wife.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: You’re my wife, Janine. Please make love to
me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No, no. Nick, please. Stop. Let’s stop. I… I
want to put my contacts in… I can’t see anything…</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Make love to me, make love to me, love, love
to me…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I want to be able to see us, Nick. I… I’m
going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that
OK? I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Ooooooooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: Janine, Janine, Janinnnnnneeee!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I’m here, Nick. Janine is here.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Betts? Betts? It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: Miss! Nurse! Come back! Cabiria, she
needs something…!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so hideous.
Everything dies and rots and disappears. I’m going to die, and you’re
going to die, and Nick…</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: There, there, there. It all gets sorted out
in the genes and chromosomes. It’s not for us to think about at all.
It’s not our problem at all, ’Nine. We’re just here to exist and to have
a good time. Exist and have a good time. Do I feel good, ’Nine? Do I
feel good to you?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such
a cosy body. I’m jealous, I’m so skinny.</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: it were the most ordinary request in</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Betts! You can’t really be saying that! You
just can’t!</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: Let’s not talk any more, ’Nine, shall we?
Let’s kiss and make up. Let’s kiss… kiss and make up, shall we?
’Nine?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Roger? Roger, are you here?</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: …haven’t seen anything that looks like
trouble at all. Just filling in for Walter… the doorman. But if you want
me to call the police, I will.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Apartment 307? Visiting my sister.</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: Yes? Who is there?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: It’s Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me
speak to the nurse, please.</p>
<p><strong>mr. spergazzi</strong>: Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I
think she must go to look for you.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I wonder if
I could talk to you for a second in my office?</p>
<p><strong>miss lewis</strong>: Why don’t you do something about all
that noise? We like parties, but this is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: Well, there may be a connection. See, it’s
about your locker. ’Fraid somebody busted into it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>miss lewis and mr wolf</strong>: Oh, no! What a drag!</p>
<p><strong>merrick</strong>: ’Fraid so. I’ve got a few of the things
they threw around in my office and if you could identify it…</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Rollo’ll be here soon. Rollo’ll be here
soon.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Hello, good evening, is anybody here?
Dr. St. Luc? It’s Dr. Linsky here to see you for consultation.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: It’s Dr. Linsky. Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It’s Dr. Linsky.
I’m meeting Dr. St. Luc here. He must be a little bit late.</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is that you?
Tudor? Mind if I have a look at you?</p>
<p><strong>rollo</strong>: Just a peek, OK? A little peek won’t
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: No, no, no, no. Mustn’t, mustn’t. You mustn’t
kill them, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: No, no. You mustn’t kill them. That’s my
blood you’re spilling! My blood! Let them come home, let them come home,
home, home inside me. Don’t kill them…!</p>
<p><strong>tudor</strong>: At least save me one! For God’s sake! At
least save me one. One, one, one, one…</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Can you walk? I couldn’t find anything
wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Rollo and the police should be here by now.
It’s just a question of avoiding infected residents until we find
them.</p>
<p><strong>st.luc</strong>: OK? Ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>forsythe</strong>: Sometimes I have a recurrent dream. Have I
ever told you about it, darling? I guess you could call it a Freudian
dream, because in this dream I find myself making love to Sigmund Freud.
But I’m having trouble because he’s old and dying, and he smells bad and
I find him repulsive. And then he tells me that everything is erotic,
everything is sexual, you know what I mean? He has a very thick accent,
but I can understand him perfectly. He tells me that even old flesh is
erotic flesh, that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures
for each other, that dying is an act of eroticism, that even chemicals
combine out of sexual frenzy and longing. That breathing is sexual, that
talking is sexual, that just to physically exist is sexual… And I
believe him, and we make love beautifully…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hellooooo? Oooooo? Is there anyone here who’s
all alooooooooone?</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Forsythe! Forsythe!</p>
<p><strong>st. luc</strong>: Have you seen the police? I’m Dr. St. Luc.
Have you seen the police? Have they come?</p>
<p><strong>betts</strong>: A kiss! Give him a kiss. Give him a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>various residents</strong>: A kiss, a kiss, a kiss!</p>
<p><strong>kresimir</strong>: Nobody should be alone! Nobody should be
alone tonight!</p>
<p><strong>residents</strong>: Nobody alone! Nobody alone!</p>
