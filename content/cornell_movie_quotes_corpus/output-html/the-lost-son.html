<h1 id="the-lost-son">the-lost-son</h1>
<p><strong>hits the wet tarmac with a spray of sparks.</strong>: IN AND
HOLD ON XAVIER LOMBARD, at the wheel of a TRIUMPH 2000. Late 30s, dark,
short hair, stony-faced, in a conservative dark suit and white shirt -
collar button undone… Through the open window his eyes survey… BEYOND
OPEN GATES FLANKED WITH A SECURITY CAMERA: the lit- up facade of a white
mansion fronted by a gravel drive; parked there: A BLUE ASTON MARTIN,
TWO FERRARIS AND A DAIMLER…</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Mister Xavier Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: That�s right.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Will you please come with me?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: That might depend on where you�re
going.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes�
majordomo. They are expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs
Spitz.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr
and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Mister Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>we find…</strong>: An old couple, THE SPITZES, sit side by
side at a glass table, strangely upright, she dark, intense, her hands
on a large envelope, he morose and bespectacled, with a coffee mug and
half- eaten DOUGHNUT… DEBORAH stands behind them, arms crossed, a
cigarette between her fingers… And, deep in the room by a blazing fire,
CARLOS and MR BANI sit in armchairs studying huge technical diagrams and
EYEING LOMBARD ABSENT-MINDEDLY. Mrs Spitz motions to the chair of
twisted metal opposite her, saying, in a strong, rasping GERMAN
ACCENT:</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: You are late, Mr Lombard. I very much
hope you are better at your job than at keeping time. Anyway, come and
sit down.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Good afternoon, Mrs…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Spitz. We spoke on the telephone. My
husband… My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is. My son-in-law,
Carlos… The gentleman is a business partner of his.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Come, come, give the man time to probe,
Mummy. Don�t you know private detectives like to appraise people? Aren�t
I right, Mr Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The pleasure is mine, Mrs De Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: May I…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr
Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I hope it�s not too significant.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: What if it is?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well, I would have to point out that we
could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs
Spitz. I wouldn�t like to think I�d kept you waiting for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Whatever, you come recommended. We…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Recommended?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Must I speak to you in French?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Didn�t you say I came recommended? That�s
what I thought. May I know by whom?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: You may not. And besides, it is
irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Okay. Recommended…</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Good. Now, as I trust you may have
guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose
discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would
give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr
Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Look Mrs Spitz… I don�t know to whom I�m
indebted for the recommendation but… I�m not in the business of making
oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is
listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge
whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs
Spitz.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr
Lombard!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Would you like a doughnut, Mr Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Don�t disturb the butler. I remember the
way out.</p>
<p><strong>mister spitz</strong>: Sit down, please, Mr Lombard. Sit
down…</p>
<p><strong>mister spitz</strong>: Please, forgive us. We did not mean to
offend you. It�s just that…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Let him go, Daddy. This is pointless
anyway. Wonder boy�s soon enough going to run out of cash and stagger
back to the nest.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Shut up, Deborah!</p>
<p><strong>mister spitz</strong>: We were hoping to ask you to look for
our son, Mr Lombard. He… He has been missing for three weeks now. We are
worried he might be in trouble…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, come on! If you must go ahead with this
you might as well get to the point. As for you, if you�re determined to
stay and hear about my dear brother�s riveting personality, you might as
well sit down again. Boredom is easier handled that way. And by the way,
before you ask, the boy Leon is 31 years old.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I take it your son is called Leon?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr
Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well
know that…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: For Bohemian read ex-university drop-out
and ex-failed rock star recently turned Artist Photographer. Oh yes, and
a most likely relapsing ex-heroin addict.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: We do not know that for certain,
Deborah!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I said �likely�, Mummy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Leonard is a good boy, but sadly he likes
bad company and is susceptible… Two years ago we sent him to a… a
detoxification clinic. It has had the desired effect. He has since been
very content living in the apartment I bought him here in London and,
until three weeks ago, he called every fortnight to our home in
Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Money doesn�t grow on trees…</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Leonard is now devoting his time to
photography. It is good for him. My husband and I have chosen to support
him in this. He also works, though. In a restaurant… He washes the
dishes. Three evenings a week he washes the dishes.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What do you think has happened to your son,
Mrs Spitz?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: You wouldn�t be here if I knew, Mr
Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks.
That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results.
And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for
four weeks now.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Do what, Mr Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Check with your son�s bank. Banks don�t
usually give out information about their customers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: I said earlier that my husband and I are
supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that
since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly
allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have
to break the law to find out if he used the account.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I didn�t mean to imply you did, Mrs
Spitz.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Then you should not have sought an
explanation.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I presume you checked your son�s
apartment…</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Yesterday. It all looked normal.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Did you look for his passport, driving
licence?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Leonard does not hold a driving licence.
As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: So he could have decided to go on a
trip…</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he
done so I think he would have let us know about it.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Then why aren�t you asking the police to
look for your son, Mrs Spitz?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: At last! A pertinent question. Come on,
Mummy: answer the detective.</p>
<p><strong>mister spitz</strong>: Leonard used to disappear like this
before his treatment, Mr Lombard. Whether he has reverted to his former
habit is something we would rather not find out through the police. I�m
sure you can understand…</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: ) I am categorical Leonard has had no
interest in drugs since he came back from America.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Now you know why you�re here, Mr Lombard.
It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people
of a certain standing.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De
Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: That depends what you�re looking at.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I take it your son is not married, Mrs
Spitz?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: No. And before you ask, no, he�s not gay!
He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Any friends?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: The proprietor of his workplace is the
only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with
Leonard�s address, keys and other things you might need.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m sure… As far as you know, when and
where was your son last seen?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: When… I�m told he came here…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn�t
here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an
exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos
handed over �1,000 to get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: And that is the last time any…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Well, Leon does not need money for prints,
Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn�t want anyone to interfere
with his �Art�! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question:
what was the money for? Perish the thought.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: The �1,000 is on account.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: My rates…</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard.
We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say
it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why do you think your son chose not to come
to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Ha… No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance
is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is
more than adequate.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow
for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything
before our return.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may
I ask what is or was your occupation?</p>
<p><strong>mister spitz</strong>: We make and sell shoes and leather
garments.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What about you, Mrs De Moraes?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I have too much money to work, Mr
Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is that why your brother braved coming here
to ask you for a loan?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Perhaps it wasn�t so brave of him. Had I
been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can
reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of
work ought to know.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The �1,000. You
gave it to him in cash?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Oh. Leon. Yes. We�ve always got cash in… We
always keep money in the house.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: De Moraes. That�s a Brazilian name, no?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: That�s right. Do you know Brazil?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No. Do you work, Mr De Moraes?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Work? Oh yes. I race motorcars, you know…
That is what this is all about, ha ha…</p>
<p><strong>mark oak</strong>: �So what�s your problem?� I says; �I mean,
if she�s beautiful and great in bed, huh?!� �Well, she�s kind of
psychic,� he says; �You know - precognitive.� �Well, if she�s a good
fuck,� I says, �who cares, huh?� �That�s just it,� he says; �Whenever
we�re at it, she keeps yelling �Anthony! Anthony!�� The guy�s called
Steve, right? �Sorry?� I says. And you know what the poor bloke says? He
says: �She says she can�t help it. She�s got to yell the name of the
next bloke she�s gonna lay.� Honest to God, ha-ha…</p>
<p><strong>mark oak</strong>: Oh Dear! Here�s my other tenant…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hello, Mr Oak. Hi, Savieer. You�re going
home?</p>
<p><strong>mark oak</strong>: He is. If you would, mademoiselle.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Fish and chips. Keeping it warm.</p>
<p><strong>mark oak</strong>: Better rush. Just saw a brunette going my
way. Ah, the smell of warm, moist fish… Too bad…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hello again, neighbour. I didn�t intrude, did
I?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How are you, Jane?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Must be your lucky day then. I�ve got your
accounts - you don�t owe much tax for last year.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes. But my boss reckons you�d still be better
off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It�d cost
you about �100 but he said it�d be worth it. Of course, you�d need a
partner to register. But that�s a formality. I mean, I could be your
partner. I mean, just as a name, right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Have you heard of a French film called �La
Collectionoose�?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: La what?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: �La collectionoose�. It�s about a young girl
in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then
meets one who resists her. It�s on TV tonight and as I�m in I thought we
could perhaps look at your accounts and… The review says it�s about the
conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director�s
supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know
him?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Should I?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don�t know. How many famous French film
directors can there be?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: That are called Rommel or something, I
guess not that many.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So you haven�t seen the film, then?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It�s Friday night, Jane. What happened to
your latest boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh… We split up.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well, I hope you�re not too heartbroken
and…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh no. I�m all right. He was a jerk, really.
Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss
about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Your fish and chips must be getting cold,
Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No. Seriously. I mean, what about you,
Savieer? Do you think older men like younger girls?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What about Mr Oak, Jane? He might even give
you a rent rebate.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ve got work tonight, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then!
Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French
companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that�s
what they do to their employees, isn�t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining
people�s lives. Thanks for the lift!</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: MAN: Yeah. Phil here, man. What
the fuck you doing, eh? It�s 8:30, the place is full and I�m doing the
bloody washing-up. Get your arse over here, got it - beep. PHIL: Thanks
for shit, Leon. You better have a good reason for this when I see your
face tomorrow - beep. GIRL WITH A WELSH ACCENT: Hi Leon… It�s me. I�ll
call again… - beep. MRS SPITZ: Leonard, this is your mother. Call me
when you get home, all right - beep. PHIL: What the fuck are you playing
at, you bastard. If I don�t see your arse here in the next hour you�re
through, understood? - beep… WELSH GIRL: Leon? Are you there? … - beep.
PHIL: Son of a… - beep. MRS SPITZ: Leonard! It is Tuesday now. What is
happening? I have been calling your work and they tell me you have not
been there. I am in London next week and I hope to hear from you before
then - beep. WELSH GIRL: I, er, I tried to reach you at work but Phil
said you�d left… I hope you - I hope everything�s all right… -Long beep.
Rewind.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Evening. Table for one?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon
Spitz is here, please?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Leon? No. I�m afraid he left.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Left? When? I just come from his place and
there was no one there. A neighbour of his…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: No. I meant he left as in no longer works
here.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Oh. This is… We�d arranged to meet tonight
and I�m due to return to Paris tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I�m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yes. You wouldn�t know where I could reach
him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris
gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Welcome to the club.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I hear you�re looking for Leon. That makes me,
his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon�s gone,
man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No shit… Well, I�m afraid I can�t help
you.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I take it you don�t know where he is,
then?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You
don�t know Leon, do you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I know his work better than I know him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Let me put it this way then; the photographs
and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking
weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself
lucky. Some folks just ain�t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure
is one of �em.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What about his girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What about which girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Small, blond, good-looking. She was with
him when we met. She had a funny English accent.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh. That�d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to
lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Would you know where I might reach her?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don�t really know
her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at
Camden. That�s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Could that be Camden Market?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. Why? You�re going to look for her… Shit!
You really think his pictures are that good?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Fucked-up fucking weird.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is there really a living in this?</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: MRS SPITZ: … in London next week
and I hope to hear from you before then - beep. WELSH GIRL: I, er, I
tried to reach you at work but Phil said you�d left… I hope you - I hope
everything�s all right - long beep. Rewind.</p>

<p><strong>little girl #1</strong>: You have reached the wrong number…
This is the speaking sheep. At the third baa it will be time to have a
pee - baa, baa, baa!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Listen you…</p>
<p><strong>little girl #2</strong>: This is the speaking sheep. At the
third baa it will be time for a pooh - baa, baa, baa!</p>
<p><strong>directory enquiries operator</strong>: Directory enquiries.
Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yes. I�m trying to reach a friend but I
can�t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.</p>
<p><strong>directory enquiries operator</strong>: 01766 770 471. Let me
check it for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>directory enquiries operator</strong>: There�s nothing wrong
with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is
the number of a call box.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: A call box? That�s odd. Where exactly?</p>
<p><strong>directory enquiries operator</strong>: Penrhyndeudraeth,
North Wales.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Can you tell me how you spell…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: … She sold me a couple of chairs in London
and I�ve come to collect the matching pair. Unfortunately, I seem to
have mislaid her address. She�s small, blond, attractive. I think she
drives a Transit van…</p>
<p><strong>lady shopper</strong>: Rhian Gelli is the one he must be
looking for…</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: This is private property. The public footpath
is back to the left of the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How are you, Rhian?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: On-on the ground! Lie down on the ground!</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Lie down on the ground, I said!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It�s wet. Will this do?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Where�s your wallet? Have you got a
wallet?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is this some kind of mugging? Because…</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Shut up! Where�s your wallet?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: In my jacket. Left inside pocket.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Reach for it and throw it to me. And… My
finger�s on the trigger, you hear!</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: A private investigator… You�re not
Austrian?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Should I be?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: What�s a French private investigator doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Can I get up now?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: No! What do you want here? How do you know
me?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: As you know from speaking to Phil, your
friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find
him.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: …Leon�s not here. How did you get here? Phil
doesn�t know where I live.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well, I obviously do. And I also know that
Leon�s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should
look for him.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: You thought wrong. I haven�t seen Leon for
months.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Haven�t you? Then why the worried messages
on his answering machine, Rhian? I�d have sworn you expect him to be in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: You-you�re wrong. I just called to ask if I
could stay with him next time I�m in London. That�s all.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well, since you have a gun, I�ll take your
word for it. Now, I�m going to stand up and quietly return to my car,
all right?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: By the way. Does your friend Leon employ a
cleaner? His flat seems remarkably clean, for a single man suspected of
being back on drugs.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Never mind. You were my best hope of
locating him, so I guess I�m now out of a job. I expect his family will
relay my findings to the police. I trust you have a shotgun licence. My
apologies forsounding Austrian. Goodbye, Rhian.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Carys? Tell Shiva not to be scared. The man�s
not going to come in, all right? My daughter Carys and her friend Shiva,
Mr Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Shiva doesn�t speak English so we don�t know
where he�s from or what his name is. But we have to call him something,
so Shiva it is. He cost �15,000. Leon bought him. From an Austrian who
sells children to perverts. Aren�t you glad you came, Mr Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: What are you going to do now? Call the
police? Take him away? I must warn you he�s terrified of men, so…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: … I thought I�d call the social services but…
He took to my daughter, started to come out of his shell, so… He needs
care. They don�t… Anyway, that�s all I know. Six weeks ago Leon turned
up with Shiva, said he bought him in London from an Austrian, gave me
�3,000 for his keep and left saying he was going to try to rescue
another child… Apparently, there�s plenty more where Shiva came
from.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Leon�s?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: We didn�t quite make it as lovers… Leon is a
good man, though…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Did Leon tell you why he didn�t want the
police involved, Rhian?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: He just said he had good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Good reasons?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: That�s what he said. I tried to dissuade him…
Told him I couldn�t take on another child, that he�d get into trouble… I
mean, people who sell children… But he wasn�t listening… I guess he
finally found himself a crusade… His family think he�s back on drugs,
eh? Huh… Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct
phase, you know? Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight… Some
people�s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon�s. He did beat the
drug, though. He did.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: His mother would be pleased to hear
that.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Yeah… But he didn�t beat the demons… A
quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through
his parent�s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East
End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m afraid I don�t understand.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: They�re German Jews. Came here before the
war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they
themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was
started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has
been haunting Leon. It�s not guilt, more of a curse… And then there�s
something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters… But I
think that�s just one of Leon�s dark delusions…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Do you know Leon�s parents names?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Albert… Albert and Ethel. Why?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: What happens now, eh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Who else knows about the boy?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: My sister… She lives in the next valley.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is she on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Yes…You-you�re not going to take Shiva
away?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I can�t think of a good reason for it - for
now anyway. My number if anything happens. What�s your sister�s
number?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Oh, I… She just moved. I�ve got her new… It�s
in my book in the kitchen. Wait… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: And you better stop greeting strangers with
a shotgun. If Leon�s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he�d have
found you before I did.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: I�m sorry. It�s just you don�t look
local…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No sick people in the country, huh?… Just
tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon�s story about the boy? You just took his
word for it?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: He�d come prepared. He had something besides
Shiva… �Sleeping Beauty�. The Disney film… Well, it looked like the
Disney film. It was something else. I couldn�t watch…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Moreau? Laurent… Yeah. And you?… Good.
Listen, I wonder if you could check some people in the computer… Yes,
again… No, they�re new clients of mine, Albert and…</p>

<p><strong>int. a brasserie, soho. night.</strong>: Lombard stands in
the doorway, eyes searching… A late night hang out; tired, lonely
people, whispered conversations… NATHALIE sits at a table over a coffee,
reading a �Le Monde�, smoking…</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: You look like shit, Xavier.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Comment vas-tu, Nathalie?</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Qu�est-ce que tu veux?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr�-
pubescents.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Les histoires d�enfants ne m�int�ressent
pas, Xavier.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What�s an hour of your time worth these
days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie!</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Cinq cents.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Viens.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: J�ai bien peur qu�il te faudra attendre.
Pas avant la matin�e.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Tu sais o� me trouver.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Your door was open. This… This women was
downstairs, ringing your bell.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Your accounts. They just need your signature.
I�ve got to go to work. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Bye. And thanks… Nathalie gently closes
the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake… rolls her eyes and
surveys the room…</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: O� est pass� ton salon?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Mon bureau co�tait trop cher.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Eh bien… T�es s�r que t�as besoin de moi?
La petite m�a l�air assez bien foutue, non?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Caf�?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Alors?</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Alors quoi?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Le montage, l�emballage. Not your regular
street muck, is it? This is collectors� stuff. How much would it cost
me?</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: A l�achat, trois ou quatre mille. En
location, cinq cent. Mais �a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C�est
pas vraiment mon truc. I don�t know any Austrian, Xavier.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: But maybe you know someone who does. An
Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can
there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known,
reachable.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Then why don�t you reach him?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I don�t have your credentials,
Nathalie.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Can you afford a room in a proper hotel?
It will look better. I also need more money; five hundred in an envelope
and the same again for my time.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m afraid I�m otherwise engaged.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: You�re a trustworthy sicko of mine who�s
heard only good things about the Austrian�s products and doesn�t want
anything else. He claims not to know of any Austrian but he�ll call
around. There�s no refund if he fails to deliver. You should get a call
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is he your pimp?</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes
I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: If you can, send me a receipt.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie</strong>: Clarence Square. And hurry, I�m late.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Moreau? C�est moi. Alors…</p>
<p><strong>moreau</strong>: Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn�t easy but I
got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what�s your business with
these Spitzes?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: They lost their son. Why?</p>
<p><strong>moreau</strong>: It appears that in their younger days they
were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known
as �Never Forget�. Over the years we�re talking about a dozen or so
execution-type killings.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Are they still operative?</p>
<p><strong>moreau</strong>: Their last suspected kill occurred two years
back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the
group. Still, I�d watch my step. These people are well-connected,
Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady�s also president
of an international Zionist organisation… Anyway, you get the
picture.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Mossad?</p>
<p><strong>moreau</strong>: It�s a good guess…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I met your friend earlier. You got a pen?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You want Mr Friedman - 0171 435 6268. Say
you�re calling about the puppies.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Friedman - 0171 435 6268. The puppies…?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah. You saw the ad at George�s, alright.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Can I speak to Mr Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m calling about the puppies.</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: Have we done business before?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I saw the ad at George�s. I�m passing
through town and I�m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: May I have your phone number?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: This is a bad line.</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: What sort of puppy are you looking
for?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What sort have you got?</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve
months. Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You
understand?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: We also provide 24-hour after-sale
service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would
unburden you, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yes… Good, good…</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: So, what are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What about an untrained pup, white…</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: How much of a hurry are you in?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: I�m afraid the only pups currently
available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very
cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I see. How much?</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty
with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second
option more convenient.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: … Fine. I�ll go for the safe place.</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: Have the money ready by 11am. We�ll call
you.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I won�t comment on the time but you�ll
understand if I don�t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology
and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I
have reason to believe your brother�s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble
is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by
himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I don�t know. He seems to delight in so
much sisterly love, he might become determined.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh-oh! Touch�, Mr Lombard! But tell me,
what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Don�t. You might get
confused speaking of things you don�t understand and we need you clear-
headed, at least until you�ve done what we are paying you for.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Now you are confusing me, Mrs De
Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Can it be that easy?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Can it be that you want your brother
found?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Anything is possible.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I found this at your brother�s.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Disney! How inter…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It�s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile
material. I�m told it retails at around �4,000. I see you don�t require
a definition.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You… You found that at Leon�s?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: There�s more. Your brother also purchased a
young boy for �15,000.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You seem surprised. Could it be you don�t
think that badly of him after all? You needn�t worry. It seems his
motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue
him from further abuse.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What… What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Your brother got mixed up with child
procurers and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes.
And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the
exercise. You don�t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess
is he�s either on the run, held captive, or dead. I understand your
misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I�ve seen the boy and made telephone
contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened
to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I�m here at
such a late hour. I need �20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I need the money to smooth my way, you
understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to
meet in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I will of course do my best to hang onto
it.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Where is it? He. The boy you said my
brother bought! Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I can�t tell you that yet. But he�s being
well looked after.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh no. You�ll have to do better than that,
Mr Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let
down it might be, your brother�s not back to his old weekend tricks!
Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in
grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he�d
bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which
he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your
table… Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Not Leon…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: How dare you… You don�t know this tape
belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The question now is whether or not your
brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No. The question now is how long it�s going
to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Get out of my house. You�re fired, Mr
Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Perhaps I should come back when you�re…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No. You�re fired! Get out of my house. And
take your sick tape with you…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Laurence!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I was hired by your parents, Mrs De
Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: The family hired you and I have just fired
you, Mr Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such
well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look
for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr
Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Couldn�t Nazi hunters do the job?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: See Mr Lombard to the door, Laurence. He is
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ll be in room 142 until 11am. Keep the
tape.</p>
<p><strong>man�s voice</strong>: It�s about the puppy. You got the
money?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>man�s voice</strong>: At what time will you be available?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Three o�clock.</p>
<p><strong>man�s voice</strong>: �Le Mercury�. Newman street. Ask for
Peter.</p>
<p><strong>int. lombard�s office. day.</strong>: Lombard reaches into
the pebble bottom of his aquarium, pulls out a flat plastic- wrapped
bundle… THE DOORBELL RINGS… He shakes the bundle dry… shoves it in a
desk drawer… looks out the window… Through the rain: A BLUE ASTON MARTIN
is doubleparked down below.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I still don�t buy your story but I figured
it can�t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you
do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could
always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You drive a hard bargain.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You�ve got your money. Do your work.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: We open at six.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Five to three. You�re early.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Should I come back in five minutes?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: May I offer you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No. I�d like to see what I�m buying.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I gather we�ve done business with a friend of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Have you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The person who put us in touch seems to think
so.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I don�t recollect mentioning a friend.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your lady friend did.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The lady�s not a friend. She�s a whore.
Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could
be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And while visiting our fair city you… An
Austrian?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: An Austrian.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: An Austrian… Not much to go on, is it?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Questions can amount to revelations. Now,
I�d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount
of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman
led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it
just you or…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ll be alone.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You must agree to be blindfolded… Just for
the journey. It might appear unseemly - you�re the paying customer - but
ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Number six.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Number six. We�re on our way… Stop in a quiet
spot when you can, Jack…</p>
<p><strong>ext. the mercedes is stationary in a quiet street…</strong>:
INT. MERCEDES. Lombard stretches out on the floor between the front and
rear seats, holding the hood… Peter, sitting in the front now, looks
back…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Drive carefully…</p>
<p><strong>man�s voice</strong>: I hope your journey wasn�t too
unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What happens now?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We conclude our transaction.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The room�s yours for 24 hours. It�s sound-
proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find
useful. You can do anything you like.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Anything at all. I presume you won�t want to
take the boy with you when you�re finished? There�s a �500 fee for
disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Vous �tes Fran�ais?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He�ll take you to the boy. Don�t forget your
briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: I�ll lock behind you. Pick up the intercom
when you�re finished or if you need anything, alright?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Do you speak English? Fran�ais?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You go in there. In there, yes….</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It�s all right, huh. You sit down. Sit.
Good. You eat your chocolate. It�s yours.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You stay here and be quiet, okay. Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: There�s no toilet paper. There�s no toilet
paper. Uh-huh. I�m sure. And hurry, will you.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: On the bed!</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Where is the Austrian?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: You… Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You�re not playing with little boys now,
scumbag. Where is the Austrian?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Jee… Fuck… You�re fucking mad!</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Who are you?</p>

Austrian?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Yes. Friedman�s the fuckin� Austrian!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: I don�t know. He�s gone! He�s gone. I don�t
fucking know where, I swear… He�s gone. On holiday…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: …On holiday?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Yeah… This morning. He left this fucking
bloody morning… Jesus, man, my knees…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Who�s the money man?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Who? Martin… He�s Martin…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Ever seen him before?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: No… No… I swear…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What�s this place? A hotel of some
kind?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Yeah… The Diplomat.</p>

<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Finsbury Park. We�re in Finsbury Park.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Where are the kids?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: What kids?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where
are the other five?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: I don�t know… This is just a delivery place,
man! I swear I don�t know where the kids are… I work for Martin, that�s
all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: And who does Friedman work for?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: The company. We all work for the company.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What company?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: I don�t know. I don�t know, man. I don�t even
know Friedman that well… I… Man, you�ve got to get me out of here…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How many of you scumbags are here?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Just me… Martin�s gone back to the
Ambassador. Look…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What�s the Ambassador?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives
there. He took your money. He�s got a safe… I need a doctor…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What about the staff? They�re in on what�s
going on, aren�t they? How many of them?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids.
They run the place. Look, man, I�ve got to get to…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What colour is your car? What colour is
your car?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: B-Black…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>giant</strong>: Downstairs… At the front… Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>ext. the diplomat/streets, finsbury park. dusk.</strong>:
…Out, into POURING RAIN. Hugging the boy to him, Lombard turns right
outside the door and hurries away… He looks back over his shoulder just
once before… He turns the corner… Crosses the road… Strides past shops…
Turns another corner… stops and, pocketing his gun, searches the street…
Sees…</p>
<p><strong>ext. bus shelter. dusk.</strong>: TWO WOMEN wait for a bus…
IN ON WOMAN #1: an instinctive smile as… IN ON WOMAN #2: a frown as…
Lombard steps into the shelter still hugging the boy… He returns woman
#1�s smile, puts the boy down, scrutinizes him… The boy stands in his
plimsolls, wet and shivering, clasping his sodden chocolate bar to his
chest, staring at the ground…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Qu�est-ce que je vais faire de toi,
hein?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I just found him standing all alone in the
rain. I�d be grateful if one of you would be kind enough to take him to
the local police station. His parents are probably looking for him.
Sorry. I�m in a hurry. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Hello there. Martin around?</p>
<p><strong>male receptionist</strong>: Er, Mr Martin�s gone to the
dentist. He should be back soon. If you want to wait…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Thank you. I�ll come back later.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How are you, Martin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Problems?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is my money in there?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Uh-huh. You could�ve waited for me
inside.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Let�s go.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don�t know what your problem is, but…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Right now your big friend at the Diplomat
is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to
soon. And he did cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: If it�s money you want you�re making a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Ever seen him before?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Am I supposed to know him?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Clients come and go.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: This one came back and was never seen
again. I understand Friedman looked after him.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Huh, I doubt it… Friedman only deals
directly with select customers. I handle the rabble…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Where is Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Look, I don�t think you�re fully aware of
what you�re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either
pays too well or misinformed you. Why don�t you just tell me what it is
you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: If I were you I�d stop acting dumb and
narrow down my thoughts to speculating on whether I�m going to kill you
even if you do answer my questions, Martin. Now, where is Friedman?
Where is Friedman, Martin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Alright. Alright… You�re not gonna like it…
Right now Friedman must be landing in Los Angeles. Not due back for a
month.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What�ll you do now, eh? Fly to the U.S. or
make an appointment for next month?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Friedman lives with you at the
Ambassador?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No. In Hampstead… Why?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Don�t jump any red lights.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: This car needs petrol.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Shut up and drive!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: So this is Friedman�s… How many kids is
that worth, eh? Pull across and park in front of the drive.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You�re out of your mind. What�s the
idea?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Maybe the thought of people like you going
on holiday bothers me. Come on, let�s go…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is it real? You people are sick.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Huh. I�d have thought a tough guy like you
would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the
client�le. Get rid of them and we�re out of business.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you
like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Maybe I don�t.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who
can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who
can�t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes
upsetting headlines.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m overcome by your
public-spiritedness.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Boys like the one you met today are surplus.
Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world
they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where
they�re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is
that too hard for you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you
down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the
middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Huh… I�m sure there�d be lots of takers.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Could someone have hurt you that bad?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Come on. Let�s find somewhere to keep you
out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>int. office, friedman�s cottage. evening.</strong>: Lombard
sits in a swivel chair at a leather-topped desk, its drawers pulled
open. Lighting a Gitane he solemnly surveys…</p>
<p><strong>sketch of the picasso nude from friedman�s drawing
room…</strong>: Lombard peers at the painter�s signature… illegible… The
man�s eyes… intense and dark… He unhooks the painting, turns it
over…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thought I might as well have a go. You were
going to bump me off anyway, weren�t you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is this Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Who are you? Who are you working for,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is this Friedman, Martin? Come on, scumbag.
You�ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he
is in Los Angeles and what name he�s using?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You�re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever
he is, your guy�s not one of Friedman�s…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You seem very sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I told you… The rabble, it�s me… Huh… It�s
sad.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Dying without ever reaching the top…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Feel the invigorating tonic of pain,
Martin? It�s amazing how long a dying man can be kept alive. Sometimes
it�s just a matter of keeping his adrenalin flowing. I�m going to keep
yours swirling until you wish you�d never turned bad.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Trying to say something, Martin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hyatt… Friedman�s… at the Hyatt…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The Hyatt…? What�s that?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ho-hotel… Los Angeles… He…</p>
<p><strong>ext. howling wind and rain, a starter motor turning
over..</strong>: Lombard, in the BMW, trying and trying to start the
engine… INT. Lombard gives up, scowls at… IN ON the GLOWING FUEL WARNING
LIGHT on the dash… He inspect his blood spattered coat, peers through
the pouring rain to Friedman�s cottage… turns to… In the wet distance,
the halo of a phone box… He swallows without parting his lips and… EXT.
Through the deluge, Lombard strides away from Friedman�s cottage…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It�s me. Be at my office in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Thank you for coming. Come in and close the
door, will you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my
social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It may not look as good as yours but I
guess you won�t mind. The envelope contains what I know. Plus the
location of your brother�s boy.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You lost my money?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You could say that. And Friedman left this
morning for Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Who is Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The man who sold the boy to your
brother.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I�m impressed. That information could have
cost me �20,000.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well, I found a little more than that. Let
me put it this way:… Last night I thought your brother might be dead,
tonight I�m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise
you to let the police deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I�m beginning to think you want my brother
dead, Mr Lombard. What happened? Did someone frightened you? Or is the
job too formidable for you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No police, Mr Lombard. You talk of strange
and unpleasant things. You found a loathsome tape. Perhaps even a poor
little boy. But as yet, you�ve not found my brother. When you have,
we�ll ascertain whether or not to contact the police and break my
parents� hearts with the news that their son is involved with…
pornographers. Your Mr Friedman could shed some light on the matter, you
say. Well, find him. Didn�t I hear you say he was in Los Angeles?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Are we understood?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You watched the tape? Friedman and his
people don�t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes.
They�re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London
which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their
merchandise.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Huh! Really? Hotels?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The hotels are useful capital investments.
The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe,
and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to
boot.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved
across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move
women and drugs… Anything that makes money really.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: W-why are you telling me all this, Mr
Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: This has become dangerous. I�ll have to
double my fee.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You do want me to keep the job, don�t you,
Mrs De Moraes?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Let me know where you�re staying when you
get to L.A. Just in case Leon does turn up.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: By the way, did I mention that Mr Friedman
lives just around the corner from you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why won�t you tell me where you�re going?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: When I�m back. If you look after my fish
well.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Who was that woman? She�s French, isn�t
she?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: She used to be my girlfriend, Jane. Here.
You�ll be late for work. And you can pick up my accounts from the desk.
They�re signed.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: She�s pretty… See you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Bye bye, Jane. And don�t be naughty.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Actually, I�m thinking of becoming a
lesbian…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Hello. This is Mr Lombard - I…</p>
<p><strong>woman�s voice</strong>: Ooh, yes. Rhian said you might call.
She�s fine. I saw her this morning…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Good. Tell her I called, all right.</p>
<p><strong>nathalie�s answering machine</strong>: CLICK… I am not here.
Leave a message after the beep or try again later. Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: C�est moi. R�ponds si t�es l�,
Nathalie…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Your friend… … your man called with what I
needed but things got a bit messy. I think you�d be wise to go away for
a while. They don�t know who I am but they know you led me to them…
…I�ll be away a few days. Look after yourself, okay.</p>

<p><strong>young guy</strong>: Right. Where to now, sir!</p>
<p><strong>hyatt operator</strong>: I�m sorry but Mr Gluck is not

<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ll call again.</p>
<p><strong>hyatt operator</strong>: The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I
help you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Can I have the reception desk, please.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: This is Mr Gluck, room 337. I am expecting
delivery of a parcel at the hotel in the next hour or so. Could you see
to it that it is taken to my room immediately.</p>
<p><strong>hyatt receptionist</strong>: Fine, Mr Gluck. Room 337. No
problem.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ll have them too.</p>
<p><strong>lady shop assistant</strong>: How will you be paying,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Cash. You wouldn�t happen to have a sticky
label and a pen. I need to send the chocolates somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>shop assistant</strong>: We have packs of ten labels for two
dollars and pens… Well, I guess I could lend you a pen.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: That�s very kind. I guess I better buy a
pack of labels then.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Would you please see this is delivered to
the Hyatt in ten minutes…</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Oh. Hi there. Mr Gluck…?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>

<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Just a moment… Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266

<p><strong>deborah</strong>: …7548. Have you… Have you found him
yet?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yes… You woke me up… It�s the middle of the
night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Not yet. The place I hoped to find him
turns out to be little more than a contact address. I�ll give it 24
hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont.
Paul Lamont, all right?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Paul Lamont…?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>effeminate waiter</strong>: Good morning, sir. How can I help
you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: A coffee and a couple of croissants.</p>
<p><strong>effeminate waiter</strong>: Crow what?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Croissants.</p>
<p><strong>effeminate waiter</strong>: I�m sorry, sir. Could you try
that again?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Croissants. Like that…</p>
<p><strong>effeminate waiter</strong>: Oh! Crescents.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The word for those things is
croissants.</p>
<p><strong>effeminate waiter</strong>: Not in America, sir. You must be
from Europe. So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?</p>
<p><strong>hyatt operator</strong>: Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact
he called this morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better
be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he
cares about his puppies. Got that?</p>
<p><strong>hyatt operator</strong>: Got it. Puppies.</p>

our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>

THE ENGINE DIES… A COUPLE OF DOORS OPEN AND SLAM SHUT… THE SOUND OF
MUFFLED CONVERSATION… The trunk swings open… A BLINDING TORCH BEAM hits
Lombard… He shields his eyes behind bloody hands, his face and hair also
wet with blood… We hear FRIEDMAN�S VOICE .</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: What is this blood? I told you not to
injure him.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: We didn�t do that. He must have gotten
thrown around on the last stretch of road.</p>
<p><strong>friedman</strong>: Huh! Do you have his belongings?</p>

can�t…</p>
<p><strong>a spear of sunlight falls across cold blue adolescent
eyes</strong>: WATCHING… Lombard�s head against a white pillow, cleaned
up and shaven but covered in sweat, muttering wildly to himself with his
eyes closed… Now he opens his eyes, stares, sits up and sees… The
adolescent , a rifle across his lap, eyes him from a chair… He stands,
hurries out, leaving the door open. We hear his feet on the stairs…
Lombard scans the room… He�s in an old timber bed with a home- made
quilt… bare floorboards, patterned fabrics, papered walls, a jug and
bowl, an oil lamp beside the bed - all old and clean, as if he�d arrived
in the past… He examines his arm… A bruise where he was stabbed with the
needle… He turns to…</p>
<p><strong>man�s voice</strong>: You�re no citizen of these United
States, are you?</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: And you ain�t neither one of those
damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting
ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: I didn�t think so. The rags on their
sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are
ever found with… I don�t wanna know who you are or how come you ended up
roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know I�d have let you fry
to a buzzard meal if not for this…</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: Now, can you stand up? Can you use your
legs and stand up?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I… How long have I been here?</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: Three days and that�s three days too
many.Come on. Get your ass up.</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: Huh… I guess you ain�t quite ready for
civilisation yet… I�ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you�re on
your way.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Los Angeles?</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: Los Angeles is 100 miles away.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�d appreciate it if I could use your
phone.</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: I�m sure you would. But if I had one, I
wouldn�t let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until you�re
told otherwise. And for what it�s worth, I wouldn�t try anything that
might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. I�d sooner shoot
you than have you upset me…</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: Barstow�s 30 miles to the left. Los
Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you�re heading, I reckon
somebody�ll pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Huh… I suppose the idea of a one day trip
to Los Angeles doesn�t appeal to you…</p>
<p><strong>old cowboy</strong>: Is that where lawyers toil for an
industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young
women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists? You go to
your world, I�ll stay in mine. So long, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Los Angeles, � droite…</p>
<p><strong>young receptionist</strong>: I�m sorry, Mr Lamont. According
to our records no personal property was found in room 504 after
settlement of the account.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Could you tell me who settled my bill?</p>
<p><strong>young receptionist</strong>: No. It was a cash payment. I�m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Let me see your phone directory, will you?
Your phone directory!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Mrs Stewart?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: You got an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Could you tell Mrs Stewart that Mr Paul
Lamont wants to see her. It�s important.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: There�s a Mr Lamont out here for Ms
Stewart. Says it�s important but no appointment…</p>
<p><strong>bespectacled young man</strong>: Er, good afternoon, Mr
Lamont… Ms Stewart is in a meeting right now. Perhaps if you could let
me know what you wish to discuss I could arrange an appointment for you
to see her.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Tell Ms Stewart I�ll be outside. And she
better come if the purpose of this set-up of yours is to help kids
rather than to provide you with an easy living.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Mr Lamont?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Emily Stewart. The �easy living� lady. If
this concerns a child or children�s well- being, I suggest you contact
the police. The foundation is not a law enforcement agency.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m afraid it�s not that simple. Good
afternoon, Miss Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�d rather speak to Miss Stewart alone. You
can watch from the next bench if you like.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: May I ask where you�re from, Mr Lamont?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Europe… France. I�m French but I live in
London… … England.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You�re a long way from home…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You wouldn�t have a cigarette, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I don�t smoke. If you could get to the
point…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You�re sure you won�t sit down, Miss
Stewart?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I�m fine standing, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Am I right in thinking someone in your line
of work is aware of the existence of child traffickers, Miss
Stewart?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Good… I�m a private investigator. I�m here
on the trail of an Austrian child procurer. I cannot say if his
operation extends to your country but I doubt he�s here to enjoy the
sunshine. I believe he killed a man I was hired to find back in London.
A few days ago he also tried to kill me. He didn�t succeed but it�s left
me stranded without money, passport or a decent wardrobe in this distant
land… I need help to finish what I came here to do, Miss Stewart - to
find him and, perhaps, see to it that he doesn�t hurt anyone again… Your
help, Miss Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me
guess. You want money, right?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: A small loan would be welcome. More
urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can
be sent to me.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I can�t believe this… What�s coming now, eh?
If I don�t pay all Hell�s gonna break loose, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well, I�d sooner mug an old lady…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You… Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Listen and listen well, Mister! I don�t care
if you�re just sick or if some other sick mind put you up to this.
Either way, don�t you ever come to my office or cross my path again, you
hear? Ever!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Maybe you didn�t hear me right, so I�ll say
it again; I need help, Emily. Maybe my creep�s kids don�t come from your
streets. And maybe you don�t care much about boys and girls in faraway
places being sodomised and killed. Hey, this is America, right! But just
now the man is here. Amongst your children. And wherever he goes, his
poison follows. Have a nice walk back to your office, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Merde! Keep on playing, you little
shits!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Merde, merde et remerde…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Okay. The woman just can�t walk away… I want
straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can�t you go to
your Embassy?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: French people need a visa to enter this
country. That takes time and I didn�t have any. I used a British
passport. My name�s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Where were you staying before the attempt on
your life and why can�t you go back there?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out
in my absence.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: By your Austrian?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You don�t know why he�s come to Los Angeles?
The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No. A poor little rich boy who thought he�d
save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second
shopping expedition.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I need a few numbers where I can check you
out. And don�t tell me you can�t.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Have you never heard of collect calls,
Mr…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Lombard… It will take a few days for the
things I need to get here. Meanwhile I�d sooner not draw police
attention walking the streets like a hungry dog…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: There are over 4 million people in this city
- why me?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I thought you�d never ask… As I was having
my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your
photograph in the Los Angeles Times… There�s a tough lady, I thought.
Just the kind who might help me…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Jane�s infatuated with me, so try not to
shatter her dreams. Mr Oak�s my landlord, so I�d rather you didn�t call
him. Nathalie is… Nathalie is Nathalie. And Moreau is a cop. He�s in
Paris, the others in London. Sorry, that�s all I can do. I don�t have
that many friends…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You know where to look for your Austrian,
right?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I know where to look.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I might come back, I might not. But if I do,
it won�t be for a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Emily? I could do with a cigarette and
something to eat… I�ll pay you back.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Mr Lombard!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: The foundation was set up 8 years ago by
Orlando Bright�s parents. Orlando died as a result of repeated sexual
abuse and a systematic draining of his blood in what pathologists could
only describe as a ritual sadistic killing. He�d vanished while riding
his bike to school…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: When his body was found in a wood four weeks
later, his ankle was broken and bore the scar of a tight shackle. He was
nine…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: I�ll be in my office…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Our team includes doctors, therapists, social
workers and volunteers. We try to help abused kids cope with their
memories,…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: …Offer what support we can to the families of
disappeared children. Monitor court cases. Compile dossiers of
disturbing information that comes in, and spend way too much time trying
to raise funds and convince law enforcement agencies of the reality of
the perverse practices that go on in this beautiful world…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Fortunately some corporations think it�s good
PR to be associated with a child-care agency. Their support allows us to
go on waging our war. And a war it is…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: There�ve been 7 international treaties since
1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body
dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual
exploitation. Officially, it�s just not called for. Sit down. Can I
offer you some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I wouldn�t mind. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: A recent acquisition. We�ve had four break-
ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on
walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys
will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr
Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of
it. Your flat�s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Hah… What about Nathalie?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: No answer. You have no passport and your
Embassy�s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m sure I�ll find a way.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Like you�ll find a way to stop your Austrian
killing you a second time round?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Thank you for the guided tour, but would
you mind telling me what we�re doing here?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: How come you�re alive? Child traffickers
usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at
here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really
looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself,
Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight
problem…</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: We�re the ones with a problem, Mr
Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: You and you alone know of a child
trafficker who you say might be here plying his trade. We don�t think
that�s right. We want his name, his addresses in LA and London, and
anything you have on any of his associates… In short, everything you
know.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney�s
trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you
meet your Austrian…</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: And losing you, we�d lose him. And that
would be a shame, don�t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: If you have hard evidence about a child
trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get
yourself killed…</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Most of our information comes out of the
mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. It�s all
too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what
we�ve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make �em sit
up and listen.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: It�s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need
help, we need information. You didn�t really expect me to put my ass on
the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: A criminal?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Did you not enter this country illegally?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Huh… I have no… … hard evidence…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all
the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him,
remember? Or didn�t I hear you right?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: As I recall, you asked if I knew where to
look for him, Emily. I said I did. Even in English that doesn�t mean �I
know where he is.� Now, I appreciate what you ladies are doing here. But
I have nothing for you. I wouldn�t worry, though. The man is slimy. I
reckon when I find him I�ll find slime. I promise I�ll share it with
you… Before I die…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Dry yourself up… The address is my home.
Which I guess is also where you�ll be sleeping tonight. You�ll find us
next door when you�re done. Huh. We wouldn�t want you to go out and mug
an old lady, would we?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: … OK, Moreau. Bon, �coute, j�ai besoin d�un
passport…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Uh huh… Yes, Jane… Thank you… My microwave
is still there?… Good. Now calm down and listen…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Nambla - North American Man Boy Love
Association.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Fund raising material. Some people will only
believe what they see… And some won�t even believe that. Too decent, I
guess…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: A little too tight, eh? …They were my son�s.
Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy… I… There�s
some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you�re hungry.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Thank you. But I think I�ll go to bed. It�s
been a long day.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Right… Well, I�ll get your money first thing
in the morning, okay? Okay. Goodnight then.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Don�t fall asleep with your hair wet.</p>
<p><strong>in on… �the family that plays together stays
together�.</strong>: Lombard tosses it back in its box and peers at a
glossy publication in another: �SEX BY AGE EIGHT - OR IT�S TOO LATE� by
THE REN�E GUYON SOCIETY, Los Angeles, 5,000 members. IN ON Lombard…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Kitty, Kitty, Kitty… Come on, Kitty…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: If the cops get to you, don�t get into
trouble denying you know me. I picked you up in a restaurant and you
fell for my Gaelic charm. You thought I was a businessman and had no
idea I�d used your address as a mail box. Could you live with the shame?
My money should get here tomorrow. The passport might take a little
longer. I have to send a photograph…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well… I�ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: What am I to do with the packages if…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Burn the passport and keep the money. Think
of it as a donation to the cause…</p>
<p><strong>empty shopping bags, torn price tags and labels, the old
sneakers</strong>: IN A NEW SHOEBOX… Through the open door, WE SEE… By
the sink; A DISPOSABLE RAZOR, SHAVING FOAM, abandoned…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Tell Mr Gluck the needle man still wants to
talk and will get his puppy farm closed down unless he answers his next
call at noon tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You sure you passed on my message?</p>
<p><strong>hyatt operator</strong>: I certainly did, sir…</p>
<p><strong>duty-free bag from friedman�s room…</strong>: The men climb
into a waiting 4x4 JEEP with tinted windows… Lombard throws his coffee
out the window, puts on his sunglasses, starts the engine… THE MUSIC
carries over…</p>
<p><strong>�closed to the public�</strong>: EXT. The Jeep and Mustang
cruise along yet more chain-link fencing, stretching forever… INT.
MUSTANG. Lombard slows… Far ahead, the Jeep takes a turn… Lombard slows
right down now, peering after… The Jeep, rolling away along a dusty road
into the desert… No fence here, just an old weatherbeaten sign: �CLOSED
TO THE PUBLIC�… Lombard turns to the road ahead… In the far, far
distance, on the other side of the road… A SMALL CLUSTER OF
BUILDINGS…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Hot… These roads all round here, closed to
the public… Why�s that? Military bases? Huh. I guess there�s space
enough for war games… Must be good for business.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Must it?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: All those soldiers out there… getting
bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company
perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Ain�t nobody out there, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Nobody? Huh!… How come?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Maybe for the same reason that made
someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty
Museum…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Ha-ha… Yeah… What about that road back
there, though? It says �closed to the public�, doesn�t it?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You a tourist?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Used to lead to a detention camp for
Japanese Americans, but that was during world war two. Whatever�s down
there now, I�m sure it ain�t worth a detour… That�ll be 11 dollars and
34 cents. Anything else I can do for you, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>night. an inky black sky peppered with stars… a bright
moon…</strong>: And Lombard, back on the track, marching on, following
the tyre marks still visible in the moonlight… Now he climbs yet another
ridge, reaches its brow, stops… Below, in a crater-like hollow… AN EERIE
SIGHT, light in the darkness . Lombard frowns, as if needing time to
interpret the sight…</p>
<p><strong>doped.</strong>: Lombard moves on, ducks beneath another
window giving into the games room and along to the next… A BUSY KITCHEN:
A UNIFORMED CHEF puts the final touch to a tray of canap�s in the hands
of a NAKED TEENAGE GIRL. Around them, COOKS, PORTERS and more NAKED
GIRLS busy about with drink trays, etc… IN ON Lombard; a bemused frown…
He moves on, around a corner, stops at another window… AN EMPTY OFFICE…
We hear A ROAR OF GENERAL LAUGHTER… Lombard turns… It comes from another
window… He makes for it… A HUGE HALL. Cigarette smoke. A CROWD OF ABOUT
30 MEN and A HANDFUL OF WOMEN . From sofas and armchairs scattered
around, some accept drinks and canap�s from the trays being offered by
more naked teenage girls. Most faces are turned towards A MAN ON A DAIS
…</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: … Okay! So there we are, folks. As our
Russian friends kindly explained, soon even white kids won�t be worth
their skin now those sons of bitches from Eastern Europe are flooding
the market…</p>
<p><strong>russian man</strong>: Competition is the blood of business.
Thus spoke the Americans, no?</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: Ha ha… Yes. With prices reaching an all
time low, the name of the game has become �have-it- where-it�s-at�… As
we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest
part of this business…</p>
<p><strong>man with italian accent</strong>: Cost what?</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: Costliest!</p>
<p><strong>man with italian accent</strong>: What�s that? A word?</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>man with italian accent</strong>: I don�t know. Could be the
sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: Very funny. Can I go on now?</p>
<p><strong>man with italian accent</strong>: Sure. But speak English,
will ya, ha ha…</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: I�ll try… The future, ladies and
gentlemen, is in doing away with transportation. Breeding babies in safe
houses in the countries where they�re most wanted not only reduces
costs… By doing away with cross-border smuggling of live children and
organs it also greatly reduces the risks. This pilot-farm we�ve invited
you to is now one year old…</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: …And let me tell you, in that short
period both profit margins and demand for our products have increased
far beyond our best forecast. By guaranteeing faster, cheaper, more
reliable delivery, we�ve begun to wipe out the competition. Word�s
getting round. The long term potential is simply huge. In this country
alone on any one day in excess of 20,000 good folks are waiting for a
replacement organ… Just multiply five percent of this by say $10,000 per
kidney, $40,000 per heart, $100,000 per liver, and you might begin to
get the picture…</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: …Bringing third-world kids to where the
money is is out-of-date. Trying to beat the cops and the clock by
smuggling kids and parts across borders is at best haphazard.
Trafficking is yesterday�s news, ladies and gentlemen, breeding is
tomorrow�s profits…</p>
<p><strong>man on dais</strong>: … A safe house, an in-house doctor or
surgeon, a hot-line to a carefully selected network of doctors, surgeons
and lawyers, and a few fuckable girls…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Get a pen and don�t ask any questions.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Oh. What… Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and
about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There�s
a dirt track with a �Closed to the public� sign. It leads to some kind
of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven�t heard from me by
morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Have you found your man? Is that where he
is?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the
cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with
couldn�t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.</p>
<p><strong>air…</strong>: Lombard sprints towards the shed… The
cigarette hits the petrol - WHOOSH… Lombard reaches the shed… A RIVER OF
FIRE rushes towards the shelter… Lombard throws himself to the ground
beyond the shed… �WHOOMPH�… Flames engulf the shelter… Lombard curls up,
head in his arms… BOOM…. The shelter blows up in a deafening
conflagration… The MUSIC STOPS, all over the ranch the LIGHTS GO OFF…
Lombard looks up… A ball of fire roars into the night sky… WE HEAR
SCREAMS… He turns to… The main building: SEVERAL MEN, guns at the ready,
gape at the fire… Now Lombard again buries his head in his arms… BOOM…
WHOOMPH… as the petrol drums outside the Generator shelter blow… The men
outside the main building are thrown to the ground… WINDOWS SHATTER…
Lombard hurriedly crawls to the door of the…</p>
<p><strong>containers…</strong>: He goes on in, kicks the door shut,
stands, buries his nose in the crook of his elbow and makes for the
bathtub… IN ON Lombard; sickened eyes… IN THE BATH: the floating remains
of A BODY, gruesome, half- dissolved, face up; could it be Friedman… IN
ON Lombard; he scowls… �Nom de…� He turns to… The gallon containers:
�SULPHURIC ACID� read the labels… He glances back at the body, crosses
to the window, looks out, breathing air… Outside: A strange sight. A
SILENT, 60 STRONG CROWD. Men in suits, naked waitresses, pregnant girls,
YOUNG MEN IN ARMY fatigues and jeans, men and women in night-clothes, in
servant or cook uniforms… A mass of speechless faces all glowing in
fire- light, mesmerised by the gigantic flames… Lombard runs his eyes
over the faces… FINDS… At the back of the crowd: one of the men he
followed from the Hyatt.</p>
<p><strong>men�s voices above the fire�s roar</strong>: MAN #1: What
about back-up? You got back- up juice? MAN #2: Sure, we got a spare
generator. But it ain�t much use without fuel, is it? MAN #3: Are you
guys saying we got no juice? MAN #4: Who cares, huh! We�ll use candles.
It�ll be romantic. MAN #5: Yeah? What kind of romance you got in mind,
eh? Fuck me in the dark? MAN #4: Huh! Fuck you? I wouldn�t fuck you if I
was blind and had a paper bag over my head. MAN #5: Great. That�s all
right then… MAN #1: Hey! Can the funny guys shut up? Okay. What we�re
gonna do is syphon gas out the cars to get the spare generator going.
Frank, John, get to the gate. Pedro and Stan, take some men to patrol
the outer fence. If this fire�s visible from the road some assholes
might decide to come this way… Right, everybody, scatter. And someone
see if we got candles.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You make a sound and we both die. Let�s
go.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Sure. Where to, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: And keep your head down.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Okay, shitbag. I�m only going to ask you
this once. Where is Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Who? I don�t know who the fuck you�re
talking about, sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Gluck.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Figlio di puttana. You�re the French
asshole who bumped off the London guys…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Five seconds. Then you die.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Three…</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Gluck�s dead, you sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: You�re the lantern man, huh? If you
wanna see what�s left of him…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The acid bath?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Huh! You�ve been around, eh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Crawl!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why did you kill Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one
pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes
to get away with it. It upsets people. It�s wrong. Fucking wrong.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Huh! You turned him into a liability,
didn�t you know?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Nice way to help a colleague in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: That�s just it. The sonofabitch didn�t
ask for help from his colleagues… Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur
outsiders to fix you… He hasn�t gone to hell too soon… And neither will
you, Mr Lamont!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Are you telling me Friedman didn�t tell you
I was here looking for him?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: If he had, you�d be dead.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: So why didn�t he?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: What do you think, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I think you�d rather not know what I
think.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Huh. Maybe he figured the news our
London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client
wouldn�t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night.
And then only �cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we
persuaded him to talk.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: So you killed him and went to clean out his
hotel room… How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: That�s the beauty. An anonymous call.
Makes you wonder how many people know what you�re up to, eh,
French-fuck?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Try again, and this time be polite.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: I can only tell you what he told
us…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Not even scum like Friedman would go to the
trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Some guy called to let him know the
Frenchman who�d called the night before he left London was in L.A.
looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What sums?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Two stiffs and a missing kid followed
your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn�t need your
confession…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You�re sure he said his caller was a
man?</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: That�s what he said…</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: When they realise I�m missing…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Shut up and walk…</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: What you gonna do? Kill me?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Don�t tempt me. The last scumbag who
thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Huh. I�m a businessman. What are you,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Get the hell out of here! Go! Go! Damn it!
Go on, clear off! Wait for me a few miles back, all right? Go! Now!</p>
<p><strong>the italian</strong>: Trouble?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What�s wrong with you, woman!</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Look, you don�t tell me about some
Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn�t imagine it goes
down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who�s the guy?
The Austrian?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Who�s the guy? Who�s the guy! Nom de Dieu!
Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I�d have had
to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Where did you get… What-what did you find
out?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What… Some kind of organ factory… Pregnant
girls doped up. Babies. There�s a lot of people back there. They�re
holding a seminar. Trafficking�s the past, breeding the future…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Friedman�s dead… They killed him…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: So who… Who�s the man? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Some Italian I picked up back there. He�s
in the boot of the Mustang.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Italian? The Mafia…?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Who knows. Who cares… You wanted slime. You
got slime.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I
blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they
must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them
feel insecure enough to decide to pack up…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: We�re both thinking the same thing,
right?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Do you know a friendly cop?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Call from the motel and tell him if he
moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in
acid. Can I have the keys to your house?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: That-that won�t do. That�s not the way it
goes. You saw it, you tell it, that�s the way…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m finished here and I�m tired, Emily. You
shouldn�t be here. Now don�t make it worse.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in
acid! You think I�ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might
raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out.
Whatever, it�ll be too late.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Then find another way.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna
walk. For god�s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a
French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an
Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ll be waiting outside your place.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Damn it! You can�t fucking walk away from
this!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It�s up to you whether they walk or
not.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Me! Me! Do you know who I am, Mr…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You�re turning into a nuisance, Emily.
We�ve got company, remember?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: …I�m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who
sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy
disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat.
However I go about this that�s who I am. Do you get what I�m fucking
saying, Mr Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What about your friendly cop?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made
his life a misery. He thinks I�m obsessed, punishing myself for what
happened to our son. But he�s a good guy. He�ll listen to you. He won�t
turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I always wanted to come to America… La
Nouvelle-Orl�ans; Baton Rouge; Le Pays Cajun… Those were magic names to
a Paris kid… The far-west, wild and French…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: They�d never let me go. And you�d end up in
more trouble than you know for helping me.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: You cannot walk away from this. You
cannot.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I can… The question is, can you lie to your
ex- husband?</p>
<p><strong>lombard�s voice</strong>: He�ll come. If he ever loved you
he�ll come. You tell him you saw it. You tell him you went in there. You
had to. You got a letter at the foundation. You had to check. I�ll draw
you a map…</p>
<p><strong>emily�s voice</strong>: What about the Italian. He knows…</p>
<p><strong>lombard�s voice</strong>: I�ll look after the Italian…</p>
<p><strong>a deafening whirr now. in on a roughly drawn map of the ranch

behind the PILOT and a police LIEUTENANT …</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Emily!</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: Acting on a tip-off, police today raided
a burnt- out ranch containing the charred remains of…</p>
<p><strong>newsreader</strong>: … around a dozen bodies near a disused
military base in a remote area of Barstow county. In what is so far
believed to have been the home of yet another extremist religious or
survivalist cult group, it is not yet clear what occurred or whether the
deaths are the result of foul play, but early indications are that the
ranch was deliberatly set alight and the deceased shot dead before…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Hallelujah… Thank God for convenient
religious nuts…</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: We�ve still got the Italian…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: That�s right. Where�s the fucking Italian,
eh, Mr French hero?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I left him in the Mustang outside a police
station, with a covering note tying him to the ranch. Not that he�ll
talk.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Of course not. Nothing sticks to slime and
what�s new, huh?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from
England to clean up California. Huh!</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Emily…</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: No. You�re looking at a real Musketeer here,
Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there. Take a prisoner… Might as
well have sent them a notice to quit… Come on, Musketeer! Got anything
to say?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should
cover what you lent me.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Huh! And they say charity�s only rewarded in
Heaven… Hallelujah… Christ…</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: Are you going back home, Mr Lombard? Aren�t
you… Won�t they be looking for you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I doubt it. The Italian called me Lamont…
Whoever tipped off Friedman told him I was a hitman called Lamont.</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Shit! Fuck! What�s fucking wrong with people!
I�m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!</p>
<p><strong>whitney</strong>: She�ll be alright. She�s tough…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yeah. The tough ones can only break.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What�s the date?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: The nineteenth… How come you didn�t know?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ve been away. Did Leon speak to you about
his sister?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Er… Yes…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Did he ever refer to the hostility between
them?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: He… Apparently the hostility was all hers.
Leon didn�t… It hurt him. They used to be close… Their parents were in
their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew
up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He… �Our world
was so old and cold, we shone for one another,� Leon used to say. His
sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but
thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The money Leon left for the boy, was it
cash?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Did he mention anything about having an
exhibition of his work?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: … No.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You sure? What about before he turned up
with the boy?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: … No. In fact, I�d seen him a couple of
months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn�t getting
anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in
the nineties - documentary stuff, you know…</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: He showed me a book with a picture of a
couple caught kissing in a street…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How�s the boy doing?</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Good. You needn�t worry about the Austrian
anymore. He�s dead. I�ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>find…</strong>: Lombard, emptying another box - more
photographic stuff, prints, rolls of film, chemicals… He pulls out A
BOX-FILE, opens it… Inside: CONTACT SHEETS, SHOTS OF LONDON SCENES… He
leafs through, stopping now and then to scrutinize one or the other…
STROLLERS IN PARKS… MORE PARK SCENES… Finally, he pulls one sheet out
and brings it close to his eyes. IN ON the contact sheet: more park
scenes; two strips of shots follow A TRAMP carrying bulging bags along a
park fence with a busy road beyond… Lombard scowls, seeing… THREE
SEQUENTIAL SHOTS: BEYOND THE ADVANCING TRAMP, THE FAMILIAR FACADE OF THE
DIPLOMAT, its sign clearly readable, first to the tramp�s left, then
half concealed behind his head, then to his right… IN ON Lombard glaring
at… the strips of shots of the tramp�s progress along the fence… HIS
FACE STIFFENS AS HE SEES… A shot of the tramp, now facing the camera,
angry, swearing at the photographer… Lombard brings the sheet even
closer, peers hard at it, turns, scans the floor… picks up a
photographer�s magnifying block from the carpet, makes for the window,
places the magnifying block on: THE SWEARING TRAMP THROUGH THE
MAGNIFYING BLOCK: to the right of the tramp�s head, parked cars in a
side street; among them, the distinct contours of an ASTON MARTIN…
Lombard flicks the contact sheet over… �PENRHYNDEUDRAETH�, in his
handwriting… Lombard is livid. �Merde…�</p>

<p><strong>jane</strong>: I came to feed your fish. I didn�t know…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Oui, bonjour, Jean… Oui, tr�s bien, merci.
Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommand�mes services
�quelqu�un r�cemment… Vous �tes certain… Non, non… Je vous remercie…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hello there. How�s the flat. I cleaned…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The
one I�d given you and then got back, remember? I can�t find it. Do you
know where it is?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No… I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in
messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it
ought to be. Maybe it�s there with…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It�s not.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, I�m sorry. I… This is my nephew… And my
brother, Tim. I�ve got the week off and he�s come to stay.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Anyway. You see, your lock�s fine. I don�t
know how they got in. So, how was L.A., eh?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I-I�m sorry about your envelope, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Thank you, Jane. I�m busy.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No children…</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Good afternoon. De Moraes�s residence.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I�m afraid they are out at the moment,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: When will they be back?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late
this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you
wish…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Jane! Come on, Jane!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Piss off!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my
money, all right?… Come on, I need you. It�s important.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Just ask if they can recall recommending my
services to anyone in the recent past. Say you�re my secretary, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Your secretary, huh!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�d appreciate it if you could do this for
me. If you can�t, don�t worry about it. I�ll call in about an hour
anyway. Sorry but I�m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not
this but… Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who

<p><strong>butler</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr Lombard. I�m afraid…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I know, Laurence. Your Mistress isn�t
expecting me �till eight. But as I was in the area I thought I might as
well wait.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: By the way, Laurence, were you here last
time your mistress�s brother came over? You know, just before he
disappeared?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I work here, sir. I�m here most of the
time.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You wouldn�t recall if the brothers-in-law
left together, would you?</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.
Would you like a drink while you wait?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: No. Thank you. I�ll be fine…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?
Her brother�s death.</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change
your mind about the drink, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Hello, Jane. It�s me.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Really? And how are you, eh? Someone called
Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian
friend of…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Carlos De Moraes?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes. How did…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Thank you, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Mr Lombard…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How are you, Mrs De Moraes?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: When did you get back?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why don�t you ask when I left the
Mondrian?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I was going to phone you. We… Leon is dead.
He hung himself… They found him in Epping Forest… Five days ago…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I can�t say it came as much surprise.
Still… I�m sorry no one called you. You must have come for your money.
How much do we owe you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I�m really sorry you were not called…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You�re repeating yourself, Mrs De
Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I… Well, we�re burying Leon tomorrow and…
Look, I wish I had more time, but it�s late and with the funeral…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Aren�t you curious to know about
Friedman?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I… If you don�t mind, I do not think he
matters now. It… Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak.
There�s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you
please tell me how much we owe you?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Black suits you.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What�s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce
your husband? Or is it for your own recreation? Tell me, how come such a
handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it
with little children?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Or is it the other way round? The children
are needed because you can�t satisfy him?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You… You are out of order, Mr Lombard.
I…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How did you break into my office, Deborah?
Ladies of your standing don�t learn to pick locks between shopping
trips. Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn�t suit you! Who knew I�d
found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking
me for dead, who�d want to make sure it didn�t fall into the wrong
hands?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You�re mad…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�ve had a long and unpleasant day. I�m
tired and I�m angry. But mad? Not yet. I paid Leon�s boy a visit this
morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven�t you told your husband
where he is since reading my note, eh?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Why… I don�t know what you�re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You know he�d have had him killed, don�t
you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind,
Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in
useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you
married?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Have you finished?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: When did you learn about his taste for
kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in
and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you
find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it woman�s
intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You do have a vivid imagination, Mr
Lombard. I only wish you�d use it fruitfully instead of in being
obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what
you�re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I guess the news you�d sent me after
Friedman didn�t go down too well, eh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why did you send me after Friedman,
Deborah?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Whatever the reason, I�m sorry I did.
Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You knew he had nothing to do with your
brother�s disappearance, didn�t you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Huh! Don�t you recall convincing me he had?
You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some
merit in it.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I take it you learnt to live with yours
then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are
surplus to your well-being…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: How… When did you…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: It must be tough being married to Adonis to
end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What�s
harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or
imagining what he does with his children?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What exactly did you come here for, Mr
Lombard?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What were you satisfying? Morbid curiosity?
Was it gratifying?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Look closely, Deborah! How many Aston
Martin DB6 do you think there are in London, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Tell me, did he kill his little victims
too?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What do you mean, �No�, Mrs De Moraes?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: My brother hung himself.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything
to you? He�s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Leon hung himself.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Adonis thought your brother�s body�d be
found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn�t he?
Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect
candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are
rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might
have thought of that, but a Brazilian…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Leon hung himself…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Leon�s not found, your parents worry, talk
of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends
perhaps… and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a
small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before
Leon�s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I�d
exceeded his expectations.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Leon hung himself…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Leon didn�t hang himself, Deborah. Your
husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do
it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Maybe… If Leon didn�t hang himself, maybe
Friedman killed him. Maybe Friedman has your envelope….</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon,
Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had
he know where it was he wouldn�t have mistaken me for a hitman called
Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: …You-you spoke to him?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He
was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted
in acid when I caught up with him later.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Yes. You�re safe. He swallowed the bait and
paid for it by dying. Was the hitman story your idea or Adonis�s, huh?
What was the trouble? Friedman might have told me he didn�t know your
brother? I might have told him who I worked for…?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Your brother stumbled upon Adonis�s little
secret, didn�t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And
Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed
him when he came back for more. Leon didn�t come here to borrow money
for prints. He came to extort a second kid�s life. Your flunkey let him
in, so his visit couldn�t be concealed, hence the exhibition story.
There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? �Leon
does his own prints. Wouldn�t want anyone to interfere with his �Art��.
I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it�s the way
you say them…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: If-if my car is there, I could be the one
who… Why don�t you accuse me of killing my brother?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You�d
have been ready for me when I turned up with �Sleeping Beauty�. Damn it!
Then too I should have paid more attention. �Not Leon,� you said. It
struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn�t say �My
God!�, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry
misbehaved. �Not Leon.� Who then? You sure were right about one thing,
Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a
little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so
hard on Friedman I�d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon
soliciting money for prints while buying kids at �15,000 a go;
infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into
selling him a little boy… You sure were right. The job was too
formidable for me. But you knew that, didn�t you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Leon could still have hung himself.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Oh no. At long last Leon had found a
mission. He�d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your
husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed
too.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Poor Leon… How typical of him to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time… When I called you in Los Angeles… I
wanted to warn you. Maybe I would have if you hadn�t left me waiting on
the line. I hung up…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Don�t cry. I might become nasty…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You�re wrong about my being there, though.
Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down… Leon saw it, like
you, assumed I was there, thought he�d wait to ask for a lift. But
Carlos turned up, with the tape you found… Leon got his lift, and
accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got
out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police
about the hotel… I don�t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps
Carlos talked too much… My husband did not tell me… You more or less
guessed the rest… I didn�t know any of this before you left for Los
Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You don�t say.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: That my brother, my husband and your Mr
Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had
killed Leon? No.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why did you send me after Friedman? To
atone for your sins?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I didn�t know my husband and Friedman knew
each other. I just… Do you think we spoke about it? I�ve known for five
years. He�s known I�ve known for five years… But not once have we spoken
about it. There are things one just doesn�t speak about…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: One just doesn�t… Tell me, what does one
speak about, huh?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Think what you like. But don�t presume to
understand.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I don�t.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Is there anything to understand?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Why do I feel I needn�t answer that?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least
get a kick out of what he does to his kids.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You bastard…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Five years of it. Surely, you�d have
divorced him if he disgusted you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You splendid bastard…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Are there truly no extenuating
circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: …We�re turning in circles.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: And you still haven�t told me why you sent
me after Friedman.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Maybe I wanted to give my husband a
fright.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: A fright?… Five years of cowardice led to
your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a
fright?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I didn�t know who or what had happened to
my brother yet, Mr Lombard!</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What was the idea? Husband is filled with
fear when he learns his child supplier�s being tailed?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Something like that?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What happened? Adonis slapped you about a
little and you reverted to cowardice?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Where is that?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Simplify and damn.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Don�t you believe in simplicity?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Should I?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: We all have to like what we become. Cowards
included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it�s
never that complicated really.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You seem to know what you�re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Perhaps it came to me while dying in a
Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright
got slapped about a little.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: My husband didn�t need to slap me about, Mr
Lombard. I volunteered…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: To get me killed…?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I didn�t intend it that way… It just
happened. He heard from Laurence that you�d been back. That we�d argued.
He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything… I couldn�t
help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before,
you see…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Perhaps I did… Until fear turned into
panic. That�s when he hit me, and told me he�d killed my brother… �You
don�t know what you�ve done,� he said. �We�re in deep trouble,� he said.
�We,� he said. �We.� We�d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you
were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman
meeting…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Fear is contagious. I don�t know if you can
or want to understand, but I didn�t want to die because of what he�d
done… It was you or us…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Well, now you know, what do you propose we
do, eh, Mr Lombard? My brother and Friedman are dead. That proves
nothing. Indeed, you have no proof of anything. And even if you did, you
wouldn�t really go to the police, would you, Inspecteur Laurent
Delfosse?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: The real Xavier Lombard died six years ago
in a car accident in Southern France… As you know we have friends. We
asked them to do some research, for just such a contingency as this. You
could have been more imaginative in your choice of a new profession.
Especially since you made the front page for shooting dead a convict in
a prison waiting room.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: You know something? I�ve just seen so much
ugliness I don�t think I�d mind four walls and dinner served every night
at a regular time. I�d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if
that�s the way you want it.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What are you doing? You can�t. I…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Do you think the boy you saved might
identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your
brother�s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: He… He is dead! MY HUSBAND IS DEAD! Call my
parents. They�ll tell you. Call them!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Do you think we�d let him get away with the
murder of my brother?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: We? You and your parents killed your
husband?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No. Not us…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: They found his body yesterday. In the pool
at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim
and drowned.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Your flunkey said he was expected back
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: The staff don�t know yet… I called my
parents, told them everything… I just couldn�t take any more…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Get to the point, will you…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: My parents flew back from Israel… Told him
they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and
agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil… And his drowning was
arranged…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: He took away five years of my life and my
brother. He was sick, but perhaps it wasn�t his fault… His parents
bought young girls for him when he reached the age. For him to gain
sexual experience. When he had finished or grew tired of them, they were
sold off to procurers and replaced. It�s common practice in Brazil, he
said. The wealthy buy the children of starving parents. He got a taste
for it…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: So you did talk about it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: On… Once… Once… What are we… you going to
do?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: What do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I don�t know. Everyone�s dead…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Your parents arranged the visit to my
office?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Tell them to meet me there in the main
square at two tomorrow. They better be there. And no bad things. I�ve
taken precautions against bad things.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Why the hell couldn�t you divorce the
man?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You wouldn�t understand.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Shame… And then, a good girl does not
divorce… My parents… Do you know, they might pass on the family fortune
to a cousin?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I told you you wouldn�t understand.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Don�t forget to convey my message to your
parents. Goodbye, Mrs De Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I… We have to bury Leon tommorrow…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: The dead can wait.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: One will have to regularize the boy�s
situation in this country, Mr Lombard.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I�m sure you�ll find a way, Mrs Spitz. You
have ways of getting what you want.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: �10,000 a year to the girl for as long as
she looks after the boy?</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy�s
education.</p>
<p><strong>mr spitz</strong>: It will be done.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Look at it this way. He might achieve
everything your son never did.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Jah…</p>
<p><strong>mr spitz</strong>: Maybe we waited too long to have
children.</p>
<p><strong>mrs spitz</strong>: Maybe children should listen to their
parents. We own a cottage like this in Norfolk. I wanted Leonard to go
there after his return from America. But he would not live in the
countryside because he could not drive. Had he listened and stayed out
of London perhaps none of this would have happened. Come on, Albert. We
have taken enough of Mr Lombard�s time.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: How did Leon and the boy get here, Rhian?
Leon couldn�t drive. How did he bring the boy here? And don�t tell me
they came by train.</p>
<p><strong>rhian</strong>: No. They didn�t come by train…</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: I don�t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Baa baa. I�m looking for the speaking
sheep.</p>
<p><strong>lombard</strong>: Sheep don�t wear watches and little girls
don�t scratch, hey?</p>
<p><strong>as…</strong>: DISSOLVE TO BLACK… THEN, AS THE MUSIC GOES ON,
MOODY…</p>
<p><strong>london…</strong>: #…Remember when you were young, you shone
like the sun…#</p>
