<h1 id="date-night">date-night</h1>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the one who
told me not to mess up the precious picture piles! he gives him a long,
slow kiss.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Minty fresh.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: That was nice.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It was nice.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Hey from now on when you change the toilet
paper, could you just make sure it is out?</p>
<p>****: Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon’s over!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, believe me, we’re just getting started,
Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Look at this one of your Mom with me. I mean
that woman can’t contain her ’Love!</p>
<p>****: She just takes a while to warm up. You guys are gonna be best
buddies. You picked a favorite of us yet?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: That’s exactly the one I picked!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Man, I wish I was them. Phil kisses the back
of Clara’s neck, but her smile fades as she stares at the picture. He
notices.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I just… when I was growing up my Mom and Dad
had a picture just like this. Now they can’t even acknowledge each
other. Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Let’s always remember to have some time
that’s just for the two of us. No matter what else comes up in our lives
- if it’s work or friends or when we have kids-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’re having kids? With an “S”?</p>
<p>****: OK fine. But I promise you it’s never gonna happen to us.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah, we’ll see if you’ll be saying that when
I’m long in the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’ll be even hotter long toothed. Right now
to be honest Clara they’re a little stumpy.</p>
<p>****: Oh really? As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches
over and turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of pictures
SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil. Tell me it wasn’t the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: wasn’t the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You know how long that took?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’ll fix the picture piles, Clara. We’ve got
all the time in the world. From now on everything’s gonna be just about
us. Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>mom!</strong>: The Talking Head’s “Once in a Lifetime”
kicks</p>
<p><strong>ollie</strong>: Mo-om! It’s SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and
Clara stir .-id groan in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER
while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a T-shirt.
Without saying a word, they rise out of each side of their beds and
sleepily march in opposite directions across their suburban bedroom-
Clara down the hall and Phil to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>ollie</strong>: Mom! Mom! Mom!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m coming, Ollie!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Uh Phil?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yep?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I need to switch. I’ve got an open house.
Phil obviously doesn’t want to be bothered right now, but contains
it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah. Really. As Clara walks quickly past
him, Phil claps his hands together.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, so I say today we go for the slacker look
- cool yet approachable.</p>
<p><strong>ollie</strong>: Yeah, well Mom says that. Ollie points to a
PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh. Well… that’s cool too!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Ech. Mine. She re-rolls the toothpaste from
the bottom up and starts brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson
Pollock of razor hairs and bits of toothpaste. Disgusted, Clara reaches
for the Kleenex box, only to discover it’s EMPTY. She tosses the box in
the trash and shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.</p>
<p><strong>nt. kitchen</strong>: Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on
his papers as Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits at
the table. Phil finally notices.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ollie</strong>: Breakfast?</p>
<p>****: Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad’s a boob today. What’s it gonna be?
Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there’s any sign of his tom.</p>
<p><strong>ollie</strong>: How about… some Captain Crunch? Phil gets an
idea and writes zickly.</p>
<p><strong>ol</strong>: Captain Crunch?The cereal?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh… yeah. Sure. Phil grabs the Captain Crunch
cereal box out cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed
in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Ah ah ah… what’s that Ollie? You had a bowl
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>ie</strong>: But Dad already said yeah sure. Clara glances at
Phil. said it. I said it</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, sure! You know it’s only one bowl</p>
<p>****: A week.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: One bowl a day a week. Clara, eyebrows raised,
eyes the Captain Crunch already in Phil’s hand. Phil shakes the carton
at Ollie.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is not for you today!</p>
<p>****: Yeah right.</p>
<p>****: Worth a try.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Did you get his lunch together?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh. Whoops.</p>
<p>****: You just get his breakfast and I’ll do it. As Phil takes out
some Special K and pours milk for Ollie and a glass for himself, he
finishes the carton. Peeking back over his shoulder, he sees Clara’s
dialing with the phone to her ear as she readies Ollie’s lunch. He
stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly returning the
carton to the fridge.</p>
<p>****: Hey Jane? I’m getting a late start but I’ll be there as soon as
I can.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry I dropped the ball. It’s this Quarterly
Report to Mr. Rivers today. You know how he freaks me out with all of
his mixed animal metaphors that I don’t</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Ollie, do you want a banana?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed
animal metaphors that you don’t understand. Banana Ollie?</p>
<p>****: So I should probably get going. With the highway construction
it takes forever to get downtown these days.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: OK. Have a good day. Phil kisses her on the
cheek and Clara absently wipes it off. He looks at her strangely.
Noticing, Clara quickly kisses Phil on the cheek.</p>
<p><strong>cll. –</strong>: Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry for the milky mouth. He heads out. With
a sigh, Clara spots Phil’s left his 1�1 dirty glass on the counter. She
cleans it in the sink, then gets the carton out of the fridge to put
some milk in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her head, she
tosses the carton in the trash.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Well, well! We’re up bright and early, aren’t
we!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes we are! ike you say to me every morning.
Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and Clara’s. He tries
to open his driver’s door, but Clara’ car is parked TOO CLOSE and the
door only opens a few inches. He tries to SQ’L’-Z- IN, but ends up
GETTING STUCK halfway.</p>
<p><strong>ow! ow! ow!</strong>: Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps
between the cars and peers around the other side of Clara’s. TONS of
room. Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car’s passenger side. OPEN
HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the front passenger door.
Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear and grunts as he climbs diagonally
over to the driver’s seat.</p>
<p><strong>diggs appreciates your patience while we build our</strong>:
HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor
in her 30’s, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW SIGNS on
the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: His name’s Juan and he’s some kind of Spanish,
I think. He knows all these exclusive, underground places downtown. It’s
so exciting. And in bed…</p>
<p>****: I never knew I could still get my leg back that far.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Too much information, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: With Larry, I lost that. Everything had just
become routine, you know? Boring. Jane’s words hit Clara close to home.
Passing on through the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR
makes a weird, loud buzzing noise.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: But now, all of a sudden I’m alive again!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Good for you, Jane. Clara takes out her
frustration on the ridge, kicki the side and silencing it.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>t. front hallway - a little l</strong>: Clara and Jane sit on
the floor, together prospectuses.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: There’s this g—eat restaurant downtown we went
to the ot_<em>ar night that you guys would love. </em>”st amazing view
of the city. You guys should check it out on your next date night.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah, well, maybe. We don’t really have those
that much anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: ’t have date nights:</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: , You know, we’re pretty tired all the time
between work and Ollie. And some of the shows on TV these days are
really great. Ah. I see.</p>
<p><strong>clam</strong>: I know that’s really lame.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So it’s Phil?</p>
<p>****: No, it’s not Phil. It’s the both of us. I don’t know. It just…
happened.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So why don’t you change it? All you have to do
is stir things up and have one great, sexy, exciting night again.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I guess. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Not maybe. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Nah. Tonight’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why not? Seriously think about it. What’s
really gonna be more important tonight than that? Clara takes this in.
Jane’s right.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m sorry I’m late. The construction on the
highways is insane these days!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Phil. It’s fine.
Catch your breath. George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake,
then heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods back warily,
then takes out his binder, ready to launch into his report.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start… I’ve
been thinking… this next quarter we need to venture into open tundra.
Start really ripping the meat.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh. OK. You mean… take the fund in a more high
risk direction?</p>
<p><strong>mr.</strong>: Yeah. That’s wha: I - -aid. Sure. OK, fine. I
can work up some higher risk options and come back tomorrow.</p>
<p>****: OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want George to give me his
thoughts on where we need to be hunting too.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: s nothing personal.</p>
<p>****: So let me get this straight. You’re telling me that tomorrow
I’m going to have to interview for the job I already have? Against
George?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: I wouldn’t put it like that. I Just need
our pack leader to be more like… like a momma kangaroo. Ya get me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Kinda.</p>
<p>****: Actually, no. Not really at all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth
and knows its momma’s teat is just always there, ready to suckle. But at
the same time, momma kangaroo’s still a wild, dangerous creature.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry. Still not totally getting you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: I’ve had a wife and a family. Three of
them. It’s hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the
pack, Phil. George lives in the city, doesn’t have a family to worry
about. He can rip the meat.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don’t need to… I was
ripping big bloody hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when
George was still… in the jungle!</p>
<p>****: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I can’t be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: Listen, nothing’s set. It’s just I gotta
say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little… well…
tame.</p>
<p>****: That’s all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers! I’ll see you
tomorrow. Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River’s office.</p>
<p><strong>school</strong>: Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up
Ollie from school.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: So it’s OK if we drop him off at 7? Our
reservation’s at 7:45. She passes another MOTHER desperately searching
for a Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.</p>
<p>****: Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Mrs. Foster? Clara turns to see
Ollie’s teacher, the tight buttoned MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward
her in the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, that’s Ollie’s teacher. I’ll see you
later. Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a warm
smile.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’ve been meaning to tell you that you can
just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: I’d prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries
matter.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: Can we speak a moment? Alone?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car. As Ollie
does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Is everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: Well, I’m afraid not. Oliver’s been
antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately. Especially
Jenny Diggs.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Really? Oh no. Why do you think that’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: I’m going to leave that to you and
your nd to figure out. But beyond that, ,i: overall attitude these days
is just… sub par. E</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks
motivation and tries to just “get by” o assignments. You know, this is a
very competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my opinion, maybe you should
consider whether this is really the right environment for him.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Uh… wow. OK. Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara
climbs into the car, watching Mrs. Cardigan.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Wow. What a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>ollie</strong>: Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>ol lie</strong>: Yeah you did.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I didn’t. I really didn’t. Clara quickly
pulls out.</p>
<p><strong>car port - later</strong>: Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers
seat with folders full of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he
spots the TONS of room on the other side of Clara’s car and shakes his
head.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta tell
you it’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: On a school night? Why?</p>
<p>****: Mom says you guys are going out.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Tonight? What? No.</p>
<p>****: Clara?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Clara? Cl- He stops in the doorway as he spots
her. Made up in an evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara
looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wow. Wow. Clara tns and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I thought I could take you out to celebrate
you finally getting that report in. A romantic dinner downtown like the
old days, and teen… Ollie’s going to stay at Mom’s so we have the house
all to ourselves. All night.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wow… It sounds… great.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Great! She turns back and continues getting
ready.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s just… is there any chance we coul take a
rain check?</p>
<p>****: A “rain check”?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do a bit
of work tonight. E</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I thought all the cramming was for this
report today. Did something go wrong?</p>
<p>****: Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just decided I could play with it
a little more. Make it a little better. Clara takes him in a moment.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh. OK. Controlling herself, Clara starts
putting her jewelry back in the case.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen, I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You don’t need to apologize, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen, if I had more warning-</p>
<p><strong>e c</strong>: Then something else would have come up. You
know it. That’s the thing, Phil. We used to do things on the spur of the
moment all the time. Even after Ollie was born. Now we never do anything
together. They stare at each other, then Phil breaks</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen… any other night.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: OK. Maybe another time. Let me just get out
of this and call my Mom then. As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks
after her, feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around the
room, Clara’s SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their romantic night. He
looks down again at the papers in his hand and sucks in, conflicted.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That dress really wasn’t playing fair, Clara.
With a smile, Clara watches Phil tie his tie.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well get a move on, girl! She zips her dress
back up.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Hey sweeties.</p>
<p>****: Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Nana rented us a special treat tonight before
bed, Ollie! The Wizard of Oz!</p>
<p><strong>phil,</strong>: Wow. Wizard of Oz. Don’t you think that’s a
little scary for a 5 year old?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: No, Phil, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK… not so sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Clara? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Yeah, Clara. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m sorry, Phil. I just felt like she’s doing
us a favor tonight.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: fine. Fine. oust as they climb into the car,
Clara stops.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You know, I should pee before we go.</p>
<p>****: OK. Sure. As Clara runs back to Ruth’s house, Phil plops down
in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll just wait in the car as you go back E
inside to pee. Again.</p>
<p><strong>car - s</strong>: Phil turns on the air conditioner and
adjusts the vents.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor Diggs.
Tries to widen all the highways to get reelected, but all everyone’s
going to remember when it’s time to vote is all this mess.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You’re hot?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. That’s why I turned on the air.</p>
<p><strong>ohm</strong>: Clara shuts the passenger side vents which
causes AIR to GUST out of Phil’s vents, into his face. He glances at
Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the air.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today that
Ollie’s been antagonizing his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Antagonizing? How does a five year old
“antagonize?” I’m sure she wouldn’t have mentioned it if it wasn’t “the
Mayor’s daughter.”</p>
<p><strong>cl</strong>: She also went on that Ollie’s penmanship’s
sloppy and he’s not motivated enough.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Got all my best traits, huh? He looks over to
see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,, not responding - a response in
itself. He sucks in.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think he’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: She actually had the gall to suggest we
should think about sending him somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Maybe she’s right if the school has that kind
of attitude. Clara’s about to object bit stops herself and takes a
breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil’s hair.</p>
<p><strong>cl ra</strong>: You know what? All we ever end up talking
about is Ollie or work. Let’s just focus on us tonight.</p>
<p>****: Great. I’m all for tha Beat. They sit in silence in the
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: So what are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Right now? Traffic.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable story
from Jane today.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: She has this old classmate who went into
labor with her second child the other day. She’s totally healthy and
everything’s normal with the pregnancy. So she goes into labor and walks
into the emergency room, and the second the nurses and attendants see
her come in, they go into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s AMA?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Advanced Maternal Age!</p>
<p>****: No! You’ve got to be joking me!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: kid you not!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I know. Beat. Clara looks out the window.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: The funny thing is she’s my age, actually.
Suddenly, Phil’s smile fades as he realizes the possible ulterior
motive.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Clara picks up on his change and figures out what
he’s thinking. A bit flustered, she opens her vents again. Phil looks
over at her.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I thought you were cold.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I was, but then you turned it down and I got
hot.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But I turned it down because… you see when you
open and close your vents it makes my… never mind. Phil reaches over and
turns up the air again. Tapping his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he
gets fed up, suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding
toward the exit.</p>
<p><strong>cl aaa</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m just gonna take a shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil, please don’t. You think they’re
shortcuts but they always take longer. And we’re already-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Clara, please just trust me, OK They zoom
ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated, Clara shuts her vents, once
again sending a POWERFUL GUST OF COLD AIR onto Phil’s face. Biting his
tongue, he just leaves it blowing on him as they drive.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I promise you it wouldn’t have been any
faster. I promise! OK, Phil. Will you just tell them we’re here? I’m
gonna go pee.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nothing. As Clara hurries off, Phil, shaking
his head, makes his way through the crowds to the SUPERMODEL
HOSTESS.</p>
<p><strong>supermodel hostess</strong>: Good evening. Welcome to the
Signature Room.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thanks. The name is Foster.</p>
<p><strong>supermodel hostess</strong>: Foster… Oh, I’m sorry. We just
had give away your table.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You gave away our table? We’re just ten
minutes late!</p>
<p>****: Actually, you’re 11 minutes late.</p>
<p>****: OK. But don’t you guys have, like, some kind of grace period or
something?</p>
<p><strong>supermodel hostess</strong>: have an eight minute grace
period.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You have an eight minute grace period? How did
you come up with an eight minute grace period?</p>
<p>****: I just work here,</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So what if someone’s 9 minutes late?</p>
<p><strong>supermodel hostess</strong>: We’re allowed to give a two
minute grace on the grace.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We’re 11
minutes late. That’s just one minute later than the grace on the
grace.</p>
<p><strong>supermodel hostess</strong>: I’m sorry sir, but management
specifically said no grace on the grace on the grace. After ten minutes,
we send a host around calling your name and if there’s no answer, we
give the table away. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So how long’s the wait for another table?</p>
<p><strong>supermodel hostess</strong>: Well, let’s see… Phil looks on
as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger down a LONG LIST OF WRITE-IN
NAMES. As she turns to the next page…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>slick looking man</strong>: We’ve gotta leave now.</p>
<p>****: Whoops. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It’s OK. The Nervous Woman quickly leaves the
bathroom with the Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her
hands.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: How lc= -until they seat us?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Two hours. They gave away our reservation.
Peanut?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What?!? Did you tell them that we hit
traffic?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They wouldn’t care, Clara. If they call your
name at the bar and you don’t answer, they give your table away. So how
about a nut? A YOUNG HOST mills around the bar.</p>
<p><strong>gale party?</strong>: Clara sighs, frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I mean, did you try something like telling
her it was our anniversary, or my birthday, or slipping her some
money-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the answer!
Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST searching for the
party and starts focusing on him instead of Phil as she thinks.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m sure if you had been there instead of
peeing again you would have done it better.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re not even listening to me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah I am. You’re sure if I had been there
instead of peeing again I would have done it better.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Sorry! We’re right here!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wait. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Shhh! The Young Host approaches.</p>
<p><strong>young host</strong>: Gale party of three?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: The third’s running a little going to start
without them.</p>
<p><strong>young host</strong>: eat. Follow me. Phil shoots Clara a
look, but she ignores it. He falls into line after her as she follows
the Young Host to th restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>young host</strong>: Enjoy your dinner. The Young, Host
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: See? Was that so hard to do, Phil? bad to be
the Gales, eh? Clara opens her menu as looks nervously around the
restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Look Phil! It’s white truffle season! I’m
totally doing it!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We can’t do this, Clara.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m taking you out.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Not the truffles.</p>
<p>****: This is stealing.</p>
<p>****: Stealing? You’re kidding, right.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’re not the Gales.</p>
<p><strong>cl ara</strong>: So? You said yourself - if you don’t answer
at the bar they give your table away.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, what if they show up now?</p>
<p><strong>n clar 2</strong>: u get spanked’</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m serious!</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. What if they do, Phil? Clara picks up her menu
and reads, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It’s just… I don’t know. You used to be the
one who would think up stuff like this all the time. This hits Phil. He
takes in his wife reading the menu for a beat.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know what? You’re absolutely right. Clara
lowers her menu and they look at each other for what feels like the
first time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m sorry, Mrs. Gale.</p>
<p>****: It’s OK, Mr. Gale. And might I add you look very handsome
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re not looking too shabby yours
Mrs. Gale.</p>
<p><strong>gruff voice</strong>: Mr. Gale? They turn, surprised, to see
TWO BURLY MEN in suits at their table. The Older of the two politely
speaks to them.</p>
<p><strong>older burly man</strong>: We need to have a word with you
both.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>older burly man</strong>: k you know what this is about. you
could please come with us.</p>
<p><strong>phil n</strong>: Why can’t we talk here? u</p>
<p><strong>older burly ’man</strong>: I think it would save everyone a
lot of embarrassment. Please… The Younger Burly Man comes behind Clara’s
chair to pull it out. Getting up, Phil shoots Clara an “I told you so”
look as he follows the older Burly Man through the restaurant toward the
kitchen doors, the Younger Burly Man walking behind them with Clara.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Can I help you? OLDER s _ �’LY MAN Nah.
We’re fine ® Walking to the rear service elevator, the Older Burly Man
pushes the down button. The elevator opens.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whoa. Wait a minute. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>older burly man</strong>: Get in, please. The Younger Burly
Man coming up behind them crowds them into the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Hey! Jesus! The elevator doors shut and the
older Burly Man pushes the G Floor then nods to his partner. They reach
in their pockets.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen, this is all getting out of hand, OK? I
admit we maybe did something a teeny bit wrong, but- Suddenly, they grab
Phil and Clara, putting HANDKERCHIEFS over their noses and mouths. Phil
and Clara veil and struggle for a moment, then PASS OUT.</p>
<p><strong>e closeup on phil’s nose</strong>: An AMMONIA STICK waves
back and forth under Phil’s nose and he startles awake, disoriented, to
see he’s TIED TO A CHAIR in the middle of a GIGANTIC MEAT LOCKER. A
VIDEO CAMERA on a tripod aims at their faces and across the room, the
Younger Burly Man sorts through items from Clara’s purse and Phil’s
wallet scattered all over the table.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whoa. What the hell is this? Tied in the chair
next to him, Clara jumps as the Older Burly Man waves the stick under
her nose.</p>
<p>****: Phil?!? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know. A VOICE speaks from a
speakerphone on the table</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: The chloroform may make you feel dizzy
for a few moments, but it will go away.</p>
<p><strong>u</strong>: Phil takes in what’s going on, freaked.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen… you can just have all our money, OK?
Whatever’s there, it’s yours. We’re not looking to cause problems or put
up any kind fight. We’ll just walk away and not report anything, OK? All
we want is for you to let us go unharmed.</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: We need to discuss your little stunt
tonight first, Mr. and Mrs. “Gale.” Or should we say… what is it Harry?
HARRY, the Younger Burly Man reads Phil and Clara’s IDs, which he’s
grabbed off of them.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Phil and Clara Foster.</p>
<p>****: That’s what this is abo</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: else would it be about, Mr. Foster</p>
<p>****: Wait. `’This a joke, right? Some funny little bald guy’s gonna
jump out and scare us and say, “Gotcha!” or somethi OK, where is he?
Where’s that guy?</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: You think this is a joke? Phil looks
at the faces of the two thugs. No one’s joking.</p>
<p>****: No. Are you insane?!? You don’t drug people and tie them up for
that! This i I just- I hope you know this is gonna go way beyond a
shitty review in Za I’m seriously pissed off!</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: Yes. Well, I’m a little upset as well,
Mr. Foster. And confused. It would help me to know why a couple like the
two of you would try to pull something like this.</p>
<p><strong>t nt. warehouse</strong>: Phil’s now getting really
annoyed.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You must be kidding! Like a million people
don’t do it every single night of the week! This is unbelievable! I’m
just in shock here! Harry and Frank look at each other, puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: I enjoy your humor, Mr. Foster. Now
why don’t you start by telling me how you got into the Rainbow to set it
uD-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: “Into the Rainbow?” What the hell’s that?
Restaurant code?</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: -and then you can tell me where the
photos are that you arranged to bring tonight.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Photos? Clara figures out what’s happened.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Wait a minute. I think there’s been a really
big mistake here. We’re not the Gales.</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: know you’re not the Gales.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: They know we’re not the Gales. Don’t you get
it!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No, Phil. I think they think we’re actually
“the Gales” who made the reservation tonight.</p>
<p>****: Ohhhhhh. Oh. No. She’s right. We’re not those Gales. You’ve got
the wrong people. Really.</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: Then why were you two at the Gales’
table, Mr. Foster?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, listen, what happened is we lost our
reservation and when the host came around yelling the Gales’ name and no
one answered, my wife said that we were them. I swear on my life to you
that’s what happened.</p>
<p><strong>speakefp ic</strong>: You’re saying you just took someone
else’s reservation you didn’t know? That’s what you want me to
believe?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know that seems really weird. Listen, I
agree, that’s what I said to her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One problem with your story. When I came over
to the table - and you guys were all alone - you were still calling each
other Gale.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That was just… we were… no, you don’t
understand…</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: We’ll need to move things along,
Frank. With a nod, Frank reaches into his pockets, slowly taking out a
GUN and a handful of BULLETS. He loads the gun as Phil and Clara
watch.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wait a minute. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>claw</strong>: I don’t t don’t like this. Clicking the loaded
gun, Frank and Harry both come toward Phil and Clara.</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: If in ten seconds you don’t tell us
where the photos are, you lose a knee, Mr. Foster. Ten more seconds, you
lose another. Then we go to your wife.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Please! You can’t do this! We’re not
lying!</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: One… two… three… four… Frank clicks
the loaded gun at Phil’s knee.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh Jesus. Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>speakerphone</strong>: Five… six… seven… eight…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: But we can’t just tell you where they are. We
have to take you to them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You drive with her in front.</p>
<p>****: So what’s your plan here?</p>
<p>****: I don’t have a plan Phil.</p>
<p>****: You don’t have a plan?</p>
<p>****: No. I was just trying to keep our knees for the time being.</p>
<p>****: Well, if we end up in that car with them we’re as good as
dead.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p>****: Well, any time you want to help…</p>
<p>****: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I said quiet! They continue walking toward
the Iowncar, Phil thin ing hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he
star s weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil? He drops to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m… not feeling so great…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: ’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>cl:</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t… eat dinner and when I don’t my blood sugar…
Hypoglycemic…</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You’re not hypoglycemic. Phil shoots Clara a
quick LOOK OF</p>
<p>****: You’re diabetic! You never get the terms right, Phil! Oh no!
This is bad, guys.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I just can’t… go any further. Harry and Frank
look at each other, not sure what to do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Should we call Mr. Stockton?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t say his name, you idiot!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry! I was just-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ll just throw him in the back and have her
show us. hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Wait! In my purse there’s a Luna Bar. If you
give it to me I can find it for him. With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her
purse. She rummages inside… and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY,
spritzing Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back grabbing
his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a dash and grabs it. As Frank
blindly lunges after her, she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on
the ground, whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Drop the gun and the keys.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: oa! Clara! No Harry drops them, raising his
hands. Phil gets up and grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits
Harry as hard as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the
gun. Harry looks at him, confused.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ow! Why, man?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why,</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: ought that’s what you do when-</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil! Just c’mon!</p>
<p>****: Sorry. Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in
and speed away.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, let me just start from the very
beginning…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We got to the restaurant late because we hit
all this traffic on the highway-</p>
<p><strong>cl aaa</strong>: the shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: I just think we might have made it on time if we stayed on the
highway. Your shortcuts end up being long cuts most o the time.</p>
<p>****: OK, are you going to tell the Policeman or and I gonna tell
him?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You can tell him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Because you always interrupt me when I try to
tell stories, and every time you do it disrupts my flow.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Fine, you tell it. I won’t say another
word.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p>****: See, now I’ve totally lost where I was.</p>
<p><strong>clara and young policeman</strong>: You got to the restaurant
late-</p>
<p><strong>phit</strong>: Yeah. Even using my shortcut which, by the
way, was a shortcut - and they gave away our reservation. So we were at
the bar and the host was calling out for these other people over and
over-</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Which is what they do right before they
cancel a reservation anyway.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I thought you said you weren’t going to
interrupt me, Clara.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: I just want him to understand we weren’t really
“stealing” someone else’s</p>
<p><strong>reservati</strong>: Across the table, the Young Police
officer, eyebrows raised, watches Phil and Clara volley back and
forth.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you think he really cares, Clara? were just
kidnapped, CHLOROFORMED and almost shot! I don’t think he’s going turn
around and book us for reservation theft! Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>young polio officer</strong>: Please. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So all of a sudden Clara yells out that we’re
these other people.</p>
<p>****: You just took someone else’s reservation?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. I know! Even the guy on the speakerphone
couldn’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You two kinda bonded over that, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We didn’t “bond” over it. I’m just saying,
speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do.</p>
<p><strong>yc jg policeman</strong>: Guys, you lost We were in the
restaurant.</p>
<p>****: Ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who’s kidnapped and drugged
us thinks it’s weird to do so it’s weird to do?</p>
<p><strong>young policeman</strong>: Guys? You’re new “buddy.”</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh c’mon! And we found out speakerphone guy’s
name, Phil. It’s Mr. Stockton. The Young Policeman looks up,
interested.</p>
<p><strong>of ftcer</strong>: Mr. Stockton? Hold on a minute. The
Officer dials an extension on the phone.</p>
<p>****: Lieutecant Manning? �eeird story. Havea couple ’.n here who
claim –o have escaped a kid- 7-ng this evening and the name Stockt came
up. OK. Will do. He hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Lieutenant Manning likes to be notified
ere’s anything involving Mr. n.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wait. So you already know about this guy? You
know who he is? A knock at the door and a handsome man in his late 40’s,
LIEUTENANT MANNING, enters the room with a smile. He reaches over and
shakes their hands.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: How do you do. Lieutenant
Manning. The Officer offers him his note pad.</p>
<p>****: Nah, as long as they’re here might as well get everything from
the horse’s mouth, right? As the Officer heads out of the room,
Lieutenant Manning sidles down into his seat.</p>
<p>****: Can I get you guys anything to drink? Coffee? Water? Maybe a
shot or two of r whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That sounds more like</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: So why don’t you tell me all
about your incident with Mr. Stockton.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You tell it, Clara.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, don’t be like that, Phil. Please.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Guys… you’ve obviously been
through something traumatic tonight. Thankfully it’s over and you’re
both safe and sound. Maybe you should cut each other a little bit more
of a break. Phil and Clara look at each other, each letting out air.
Manning’s right.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Seriously, Clara. You tell him.</p>
<p>**cj __**: Well, we never a. t_::ally “met” Stockton.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: He was in another room on a speakerphone
where these guys who kidnapped us took us. But he was obviously the one
pulling the strings.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who is this Stockton guy anyway?</p>
<p>****: Let me fill you in on all that later. Now, why would he have
wanted to kidnap you two?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Honestly, you wouldn’t believe this, but it’s
because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Really? The wrong table?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: We pretended to be someone else who didn’t
show up for their reservations. My idea. And it turned out that these
people must have something this Mr. Stockton wants.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Do you know what?</p>
<p>****: Photos. Lieutenant looks up, interested, then writes again.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: That’s all you know? Phil and
Clara look at each other. Nod.</p>
<p>****: OK. I’m just confused about one thing. When you took this other
reservation, how did you know for sure that the real Gales weren’t going
to show up late?</p>
<p>****: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>enant manning</strong>: How were you so sure the Gales weren
going to show up if you don’t know the at all? Clara looks down at the
table, furrowing her brow.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Clara?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Sorry. I… I lost my train of thought.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, I can pick things up then. Phil notices
Clara giving him a LOOK.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What? Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m not looking at you like anything. doesn’t
pick up on it. Shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, well, I had the same question for her when
we sat down, which she thought was</p>
<p><strong>crazy-</strong>: Rubbing her forehead, Clara KICKS Phil’s leg
HARD under the table.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OW! Jesus! Clara stink-eyes Phil AGAIN, trying
to get the message across.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And there’s that look again!</p>
<p><strong>clare?</strong>: look! No. Looking. At all. RINGING.
Lieutenant Manning reaches into his jacket pocket and checks the number
on the cellphone. He hops up.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Can you excuse me a moment?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: utenant Manning gets up and exits the room. Clara
does to the window in the door and watches him walk down the hall to his
office as he talks on the phone. Phil puts his leg on the table, pulling
up his pant leg to inspect.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, I’m not dense, Clara. That was not an
accident and if those weren’t looks-</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil, we’re in trou</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: He’s in on this. He’s got something to do
with it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The police guy? Clara, that’s tota</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: never told him about the Gale</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: He said, “How did you know the Gales weren’t
coming.” I never told him that was the name of the reservation we</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: be I said it to the other</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: He didn’t take the other notes, Phil.
Remember? s hil as well.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: How do we get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Uh huh. I know you don’t. It
will be contained. Right now. Hanging up the phone, Manning walks
quickly back through the police station to the interview room. He stops
in the doorway… .it’s EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside at
the desk.</p>
<p>****: Where’d they go?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: They said you were done with them. Manning
walks quickly back to his office. Sitting behind his desk, Manning
enters a password on his computer and starts typing out an ALL POINTS
BULLETIN. We are CLOSE UP on the computer screen as the words come</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: We can’t just go to another police station,
Phil! We don’t know how big this is! It might not just be Manning!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well then we’re screwed! Who do we go to? The
FBI? The CIA?</p>
<p>****: They’re not going to believe us over a Police Lieutenant!</p>
<p>****: Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta lose it too. Searching
the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE. She whips the wheel
around, trying to parallel park into the space.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’ve got it, Clara. Spin it back now!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: just let me do it, She spins too late and too
severely, hitting the curb.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Dammit! I hate this!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s all right. You just should have spun it
when I told you to. Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: rn! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Would you stop it? You’re stressing me out!
Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING the car behind
them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITH</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: Hey! You just hit my The Large Man stomps
toward them.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Run! Phil and Clara get out of the car and run
away on The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe yells after
them.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: Assholes!</p>
<p><strong>ey ins lat</strong>: They catch their breath in the alley.
OK. So we’ve got no car. They know where we live. So where can we-</p>
<p>****: shit.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Ollie. Phil takes out his cellphone and
quickly dials, listening as Ruth PICKS UP.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Hello? Suddenly, GUNSHOTS RING OUT over the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh God! Ruth! Is everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: No it’s not, Phil!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ruth’s living room - continuous</strong>: Feet up, Ruth eats
Fiddle Waddle as she watches an action- packed CHASE SCENE on TV.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: It’s CSI night! Call after 11! Ruth hangs up
the phone, shaking her head, and takes another mouthful of Fiddle
Fiddle.</p>
<p><strong>alley - continuous</strong>: Phil looks at the phone,
incredulous.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? Just call her again and tell her what’s
happened! Phil dials the number again. Ruth picks up.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ruth, I need you to listen. We’ve</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: We sure do Phil! We sure do! Ruth slams the
phone down and pulls out the phone cord so she won’t be bothered
again.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Great, Phil. Now she’s not picking up at
all!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You think this is my fault, don’t you? T -
ft</p>
<p>****: No. I just don’t know why you two can’t get along is all.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know, your Mom shows me no respect, 0
Clara. And you just pretend like it isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: So you think it’s j1y fault. Listen, Phil.
Every single other boyfriend I ever dated got along with her just-</p>
<p>****: Wait a minute! Holbrooke Peterson!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What? Clara starts looking through her purse
for her phone.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Holbrooke Peterson does something hush hush
with the FBI! I think he even lives down here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Holbrooke Peterson? You mean the tongue
guy?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Holbrooke was your prom date who you said had
the really long tongue, right?</p>
<p>****: Oh yeah.</p>
<p>****: Uh, yeah… something like that… She finds her phone and
dials.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Since when have you been in touch with
Holbrooke Peterson?</p>
<p>****: We found each other on Facebook®</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Facebook? I didn’t know you were on
Facebook!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It’s a networking thing for work. Everyone’s
on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: 0 yeah? Who else are you “in touch” h on
Facebook?</p>
<p>****: Hello? Holbrooke? Thank God you’re there. It’s Clara
Foster…</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Wow! Clara! You look exactly the same</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: So do you! He gives her a big, tight hug,
lifting her a little.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: You feel exactly the same too. Phil
double-takes. Did he hear him right?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: This is my husband, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Ah! The man who actually landed Clara.
Holbrooke gives Phil the up and down with a winning smile and holds out
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Philly Cheese Steak. Nice to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Um… yeah… I don’t go by… it’s 1 - usL Phil.
Nice to meet you, too.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Well, c’mon in. If you don’t mind, take
off your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>cla. a</strong>: Oh.Sure.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Cutsdown on the cleaning. Which cuts
downon the use of all those chemicals andplastics, blab blah blah.
Reduces my</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Carbon footprint.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh. The environmental thing.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, the “environmental thing,” Phil. As they walk into the
apartment in their socks, they notice the whole place is filled with
reclaimed and recycled furniture and LIT WITH CANDLES.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: How beautiful. Or, the candles… Did we</p>
<p><strong>errupt something-</strong>: Oh, no. I jus-_. –’-D.&gt; myself
off the gr a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>phi</strong>: The grid?</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Power grid. I actually have a negative
carbon footprint now. Making up for, you know, all you “Phil”-i-stines
in the suburbs. Holbrooke chuckles. Phil’s about to say something when a
look from Clara reminds him to bite his lip. Holbrooke gestures to some
cardboard furniture.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: So have a seat. Holbrooke starts to sit
down himself, then makes a show of taking a LARGE GUN out of his
shoulder holster and putting it on the table.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whoa. You carry that around at home?</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Yeah. I’m supposed to sleep with her
under my pillow.</p>
<p>****: Wish I didn’t have to, but I just see it as… I carry the weight
so citizens like yourselves don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It’s so funny. I always knew you’d end up
doing something in public service.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know. That’s lust how I Phil looks to Clara - can you
get a load of this guy, but Clara’s focused on Holbrooke.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Yeah, unfortunately, Terrence Stockton is
not a man you want to get on the wrong side of.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: He’s like a Nicaraguan turtle - keeps his
head deep in his shell unless he absolutely has to stick it out. Those
photos must be really important to him.</p>
<p><strong>1Ͽ�1</strong>: More jicama, Clara? And sure no Margari-La to
calm your nerves?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No thanks, I’m Holbrooke picks up the plate
and Margarita glass, then crosses to his INDOOR COMPOSTER, adding the
extra liquid and scraps.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What does Stockton do?</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Officially, he runs a bunch of these
exclusive private clubs downtown where his high powered friends go to
let their hair down. Has one place called Le Passage, another called The
Rainbow-</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: e Rainbow! Stockton asked how we there to set
things up!</p>
<p>****: Interesting. I’ve had some of my guys looking into Stockton for
years, but nothing ever sticks to him. He’s very careful - ties up his
loose ends and covers his tracks. But with this… he might have
accidentally left himself open.</p>
<p>****: The th need to do now is keep you two safe. I’m going to call
the office, put you under some protection until we figure out the best
game</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Should we be worried about our s</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Wouldn’t be Stockton’s pattern to risk
ing this any larger than it is. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I s staying at my m</p>
<p>****: Aw, how is Ruth? Always thought the world of her.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: And she of you. As it comes out of her mouth,
Clara realizes and guiltily looks over at Phil BRISTLING. Holbrooke goes
to a pile of already used sheets of paper and picks one up along with a
pen.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: I’ll just need your full names and your
socials so I can get the paperwork started at the bureau. Not yours,
Clara. Know that by heart. Both Phil and Clara are taken aback.</p>
<p>****: Just kidding. But I’m sure Phil-a-buster knows ’em both, right?
Phil looks on both sides of the paper Holbrooke hands him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh… there’s already writing all over this.</p>
<p>****: Does another tree really need to die for me to get your
socials, Phil? Phil bites his tongue yet again, squeezing the writing
into a side of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: So just one kid, guys? What’s keeping
you? Clocks ticking Clara - tickety tock tuck.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, well, that’s a topic for another-</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: It’s just that by now, you and I woulda
had a whole brood.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s… charming. Phil scoots the paper back
to Holbrooke, who squints and dramatically turns it sideways.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: w! Paging Dr. Illegible, egible to
Emergency! Holbrooke and Clara burst into laughter. Phil</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: L.O.L,, right?</p>
<p>****: It’s because you’re writing’s hard to read, Phil, and everyone
knows how when doctors write things down-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No. Yeah. I get it. Holbrook. makes a big show
of putting his gun back holster as he gets up.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: We’ll have you stay at the bureau for the
night. Safer for you.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Thank you so much, Holbrooke. I feel like
we’re in good hands for the E first time tonight. As Holbrooke goes into
the other room to call, Clara lets out a sigh of relief then notices
Phil’s mood.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe I should have had one of
Holbrooke’s eeegerag warn raaaarrrrghereeeeetas.</p>
<p><strong>!nt. car - later</strong>: Clam::- olbrooke in the front seat
and Phil crt– - in t=-� back, they pull up and park at the FBI bui Aing
m</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: smells like french fries back here,</p>
<p><strong>holbrook’</strong>: Car runs on cooking oil. I just go around
to restaurants and recycle their old fry oil.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil’s really had enough with this guy. Your
goodness… where does it end? Clara shoots Phil a look he back, but
Holbrooke doesn’t get his sarcasm.</p>
<p>****: How I roll. Now for some reason they wanted us to come in the
back entrance. He makes a big show of putting his gun back in his
shoulder strap before getting out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy guy</strong>: Positions.</p>
<p><strong>fbi building - moments later</strong>: Holbrooke uses a
KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish to enter the rear of the
building, then leads Phil and Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops
and Phil and Clara FREEZE behind them. At the other end of the hallway,
an FBI UNIT in bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of
them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in charge, yells to
them.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Continue slowly down the hallway. sudden
movements. Are they armed, Peterson?</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Uh,</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the hell’s going o</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, tell them to stand down.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Uh.. .</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Tell your men to stand down, Holbrooke.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: His men? The Agents look at each other and
chuckle.</p>
<p><strong>agent #2</strong>: What do you want us to do, Holbrooke?
Reformat our hard drives?</p>
<p><strong>agent #3</strong>: Our badass I.T. guy! The laughter
builds.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I. I. guy?</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: OK… I’m not the “I.T. guy.” I help
out</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: with computer questions out of kindness! But see
if that happens anymore, Harold!</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Alright, enough. Point is, Agent Peterson
scored tonight. When I typed in those socials, an APB shot up with a
whole laundry list on these guys.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: crooked cop did it! It’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: It’s your booking, Peterson. We’re Just
here to back you up. Holbrooke… Holbrooke looks nervously between the
Agents and Phil and Clara. He turns to them, taking Clara’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Listen guys. I’ll just book you and then
tomorrow we can straighten the whole-</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? Oh no you’re not! Oooohs from the
Agents.</p>
<p><strong>agent #3</strong>: You just gonna take that, Peterson?</p>
<p>****: All right. Didn’t want to have to- Holbrooke reaches into his
holster to whip out his gun… .but BOBBLES it and it falls to the ground,
right at Phil’s feet. Looking down, Phil instinctively GRABS IT, holding
the gun to Holbrooke’s head.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All right! Nobody move or he gets it! Clara’s
STUNNED. The Agents look at each other, but don’t seem overly
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Holbrooke has a gun? Why does he even •
have a gun?</p>
<p>****: Listen, man. I’m not that important. I’m really not. I’m not
the IT guy but I’m just one step above him! No reason to do something
rash, all right?</p>
<p><strong>agent #3</strong>: You think it’s even loaded?</p>
<p><strong>a` -.</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p>****: loaded, guys! It’s loaded!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m not screwing around!</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: He’s not screwing around! He’s not
screwing around! Pulling a terrified Holbrooke, Phil and Clara back
toward the rear exit of the building. They try the door, but it’s
locked.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Keycard.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>a few fbi agents</strong>: He wants your keycard.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thanks. He and I, the communication isn’t
great… Getting the keychain from Holbrooke, Phil uses the keycard then
lets it fall to the floor as the door unlocks and they back outside.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Seriously, Phil. I’m a bad shield. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Wow, Phil! Phil feels a little pumped up with
Clara’s praise.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke. When
we’re about to drive off we’ll let you go.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Uh, they were on the keychain.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What? HOLB’?n`_ The key chain you dre-,~_d
with the keycard inside. The keys were on that. And so the hero
falls…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>cl aa</strong>: we’ll never outrun them.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: YOW! Man is that loud! As the Agents run
toward the door, Clara quickly grabs the gun from Phil and shoots,
nailing the lock.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How are you so good at that? The Agents try
the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1 tells his men to stand back and
tries shooting the glass, but it’s BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the
Agents rush around to the front.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: gotta get going! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Where? They both look around, unsure.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Across the bridge a few blocks down that
street there’s an entrance to the Green Line subway. Get on it and you
can get anywhere in this city. Phil and Clara look at him, confused.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Aren’t you supposed to be our hostage?</p>
<p>****: Whatever. I don’t know. Sure. What’s the difference? I’m never
gonna get behind that desk now anyway. my gun! I dropped it in front of
everybody!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It wasn’t so much of a drop. it was more of a…
bobble.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah, a bobble’s bad…</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Listen, if you just leave me here I can
tell them you ran the other way. It’ll buy you time to get there. And
maybe I can work on clearing all this up for you. Phil and Clara look at
each other, then start to run away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Let me have the gun. As Clara gives it to him,
Phil quickly runs back and hands it to Holbrooke</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Here. Tell them you got it back from us.
Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Thanks, Phil. As Phil runs back, Clara
takes in the nice gesture of husband.</p>
<p><strong>ext ridge - a few minutes later</strong>: A lit up raucous
PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass under a roadway bridge up ahead as
Phil and Clara, trying to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it.
Phil glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: it’s just on the other side of that bridge. I
think we’re going to make it. He notices Clara looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Nothing. That was just nice of you, back
there.</p>
<p>****: This is crazy, but you know what I’m, reminded of right
now?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Bourne identity?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m talking about right now. When we used to
walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs. We couldn’t
ever find a cab, remember? We’d grab those “healthy” dogs and cheese
fries at the Weiner’s Circle and go to the Adler Planetarium to watch
the sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Where I held your hand for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I can’t believe we used to stay up all night
like that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s because we could sleep ’til noon.</p>
<p>****: If I remember correctly, we weren’t always “sleeping.” Beat as
they share the moment together, walking.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I just don’t understand when we got so… I
don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Old.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, I was thinking numb. When did we become
one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then
and think were so sad?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: We’re not that bad, Phil. I just think we
haven’t been that honest with each other recently. Phil doesn’t
understa</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Not big things. Just little things keep
adding up and putting this thing between us.</p>
<p>****: Like the fact I know you never want to talk about us having
this other baby.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s not that I don’t want another kid, Clara.
It’s just… I used to be the whole pie with you. And now with Ollie and
your work, I’m barely even a piece of the pie anymore. I’m, like, maybe
a pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of me’s not jumping at the chance
of having the little pecan I have left of your attention going into some
new baby’s mouth!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: But that’s crazy, Phil. When you’re home
you’re the one who seems like your hardly even there! It’s all about
your work. Believe me, if you- Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR,
lights off, drive past them over the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think we’re OK. Just play cool and keep
walking. The patrol car continues across and down the street. 1�1 Phil
and Clara breathe a sigh of relief. Then suddenly, a few blocks down,
BRAKE LIGHTS. The patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS,
zooming back toward them.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now you can say shit. Phil looks around -
they’re in the middle of the bridge with no place to run. Then he
notices the lit up PARTY BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge
beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: e ’s only a few feet.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What u high? No way. But looking main at the
patrol car speeding toward them, Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the
side of the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Let go, Clara!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat,
spotting them, cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks
down - if they don’t let go soon they’re literally going to miss the
boat.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: go or I’m going to tickle you!</p>
<p>****: No you’re not, Phil. We have a rule! tickling. I’m not- He
reaches up and TICKLES Clara under her arm. She giggles.</p>
<p>****: Ah! Stop it, Phil! Ah! It’s not funny! I mean- Stop it! Ah!
Clara can’t hold on any longer…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ow! I think I broke my butt.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What’s our rule about
tickling?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m sorry! I didn’t do it for pleasure! What
is our rule?</p>
<p>****: “It’s only funny if it’s funny for the both of us.”</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Right! And guess what? It wasn’t funny for
me, Phil! Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking down
the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one knee in front of an
EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting his proposal.</p>
<p>****: B i g mistake! They look at her, stunned.</p>
<p>**a other part of the boat - m0_,’_= -1; later**: Phil limps along,
finally finding Clara alone and calmed down, looking out over the rear
of the boat. He comes next to her. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: T ’ s your elbow?</p>
<p>****: ’s OK, How`s your butt?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a moving
boat, not so bad.</p>
<p>****: I can’t even fucking believe this is happening to us.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You know, we’re kind of running ou ons.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Maybe we could just hide or something until
this all blows over.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What makes you think it ever wil</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: iaybe we should just turn ourselves</p>
<p>****: Imagine what it’s going to be like for Ollie when everyone
hears about this tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going to be all over
the papers. Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to
him.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wait. What if we found the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: These pictures that everyone’s after. we could
get them we’d have some kind o bargaining chip to get out of this.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: But then we’d have to find the Gales. don’t
know anything about them.</p>
<p>****: Except… the Rainbow.</p>
<p>****: The pictures have something to do with that place!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these clubs
are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in- Clara
rummages through her purse and grabs her phone, dialing, then notices
Phil looking out, shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re not listening to me again!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: “You have to know where they are and h to get
in-”</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s great. Clara wanna cracker?</p>
<p><strong>c lara</strong>: I’m calling because of what you said, Phil.
I know who can help us. Clara dials the number.</p>
<p><strong>clara_</strong>: Hey Jane, it’s Clara.</p>
<p>****: Where am I? I’m… I’m on a party cruise around Chicago. Oh yeah.
It is turning into quite a night. Listen, we need to go to this club
called the Rainbow later. Do you know how we can get in? Clara looks at
Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her ear and listens. Phil watches
her until he notices the boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side. A
slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: ara… Clara turns and looks.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I’ve actually
gotta jump off right now.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Check again. Manning pockets the
camera and starts to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>partier</strong>: Hey! That’s mine, man!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Evidence. The Partier mumbles
“Asshole” as he stumbles Manning si i.s and looks out over the wa</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Mine’s totally shot too.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You got the info from her though, right?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah, but we can’t get in looking like this,
Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t think we have a choice. Not a big
shopping hour. They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights
blazing. Windows show machines filled with young HARDBODIES working
out.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now if we wanted to do a little cardio, on the
other hand. Who knew that many people worked out at 1 in the morning?
Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks back up at the
building.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You wanna do a little cardio? Clara smirks at
him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, now that’s scary. You know you’re starting
to think like a real criminal? You know that, don’t you? Clara waggles
her eyebrows. We hear Devo’s “Secret Agent Man” over a TrC _ GE .</p>
<p><strong>clothes.</strong>: - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in
a colored shirt and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then
stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair blown out and in a
tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with • RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From
her expression, she feels the same about Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Down here?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It’s what she said.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And if you die, does Jane get your commissic-l
on the open house? Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near
a bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby. Nervously,
Clara approaches.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Excuse me? Men shoot her a fierce look.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Um… do you know which is the way back to
Kansas? They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them LUNGES,
and Phil jumps back… but he’s moving aside some trash cans, revealing a
RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.</p>
<p><strong>shady guy #1</strong>: Welcome to the Rainbow.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If you wanner be pissed at anyone about it,
be pissed at Stockton… Hearing the name, Phil spots a BALDING MAN
talking to 2 other MEN at one of the tables. He lingers closer.</p>
<p><strong>balding man</strong>: You know, rumor is he’s behind the
whole mess. Raking it in on both ends. What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>balding man</strong>: Hush hush shell companies he owns. One
of them hires all the construction inspectors. Another he’s got rents
all the construction equipment. The more one slows things down with
violations, more the other takes to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>balding man</strong>: My guess is he’s trying to screw up
Mayor Diggs’ reelection. Imagine what someone like him could do if he
got someone less “squeaky clean” in the Mansion. The Balding Man
suddenly notices Phil listening. Phil pastes on an excited face.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: you! Gale, right?</p>
<p><strong>balding man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry. From the side… confused you with
somebody else. Phil quickly moves on.</p>
<p>**ba –y_-_.**: really get s,-.y names.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Thanks any-way. With a sigh, Clara starts
away from the bar, when she</p>
<p><strong>freezes.</strong>: ough the crowd, FRANK and HARRY walk right
toward her - but they haven’t seen her yet. Clara spots the KITCHEN
DOORS nearby and rushes through. INT. KITCHEN - C vUOUS Clara peeks out
through the double door windows. Frank and Harry continue through the
crowd, unaware.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Watch it! Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin
board covered with pictures and time schedules as a WAITER carries a
large tray of food past her.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom.</strong>: Clara pulls the picture off the wall. She
catches a WAITRESS coming back through the double doors.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Excuse me. Does she work here?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Dora? I guess she still does. Hasn’t been
showing up lately, though.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Do you know where I can find her?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You could try back tomorrow, see if
she-</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: I need to find her tonight.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Did you try Ray’s place?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Ray?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: That sleazebag boyfriend of hers. He’s got
that place a few blocks from here where he used to throw those after
work parties.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Do you remember where it is?</p>
<p><strong>another part of the rainbow</strong>: Phil scans the crowds,
back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Phil! Hearing his name, Phil nervously
turns. MR. RIVERS and GEORGE stand together in a corner.</p>
<p>****: hit.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: This is a surprise! What are you doing
down here?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh… well, same thing as you guys, I would
guess. Working those “extra hours,” right?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil! Clara, looking amazing in her red
flapper dress, weeds through the crowd. Mr. Rivers and George take her
in, obviously impressed.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil, we gotta go. I found out where-</p>
<p>****: Clara, you remember Mr. Rivers? Clara suddenly notices Phil’s
boss. Oh. Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And I’m George.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Sorry, but I’ve got to steal him. We’ve gotta
be somewhere else right now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: At 2 in the morning? Where are you guys
headed?</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, Mr. Rivers. We really can talk about it. Phil and
Clara move off quickly through the crowd as Mr. Rivers watches the
hand_�__e, dressed up couple, intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: Phil Foster with places to go he can
talk about at 2 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rivers</strong>: You know what makes kangaroos so damn
dangerous, George? They look so sweet and tame, so you forget they’re
wild animals. Lethal when they want to be. George, not fully
understanding, chuckles and holds out his hand for another handshake,
but Mr. Rivers, still watching Phil, LEAVES HIM HANGING.</p>
<p><strong>closeup on a tv monitor</strong>: A TV MONITOR IMAGE of Phil
and Clara making their way through the crowd to the exit. In the dark
room, Frank and Harry look expectantly to the well dressed man in a dark
suit, who absently twirls with two metal balls in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: See where they take you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That never really- OPENS. She shoots Phil a
look.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK. Never mind. Phil and Clara inch insi</p>
<p><strong>run down house - continuous</strong>: As they start down the
dark hallway to the living room, Phil hunches over, hugging the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: are you bent over like that?</p>
<p><strong>pi</strong>: sneaking.</p>
<p><strong>cla?.a</strong>: Rut why don’t you just walk normally and
quietly?</p>
<p><strong>phi</strong>: This is the wav I sneak. You sneak in your way
and I’ll sneak in mine, OK?</p>
<p>****: OK. Fine. I was just asking. Clara walks quietly behind
crouching Phil. Reaching the living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES
on the couch. Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun
to Phil’s head, DORA nervously next to him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Talk! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know, that’s like the 5th gun I’ve had to
my head tonight! Just lower that thing and cool it, OK? Off guard from
Phil’s reaction, Ray, confused, does.</p>
<p><strong>dora</strong>: She was in the bathroom at the restaurant!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who are we? Good question! Well, everybody
thinks we’re “the Gales” because we were lucky enough to take your
reservation tonight!</p>
<p>****: What? Why would you take our reservation? Phil shoots Clara a
look.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Both of you. Stand ov there in the corner.
Dammit Dora, ere’s your goddamn brother? He was E,.–,-Dc.-zed to b here
an hour ago! I don’t know, Ra_, He’s not answering his phone.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, well, if these guys found u long do you
think it’s gonna take other guys? We’re dead! DEAD!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Excuse me. In the corner, Clara raises her
hand. Ray eyes her strangely.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Sorry. I have to pee.</p>
<p>****: You have to nee? Clara nods. Phil shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s my wife. Flustered, Ray waves Dora to
take Clara.</p>
<p><strong>dora</strong>: You must just think I’m awful.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I don’t think anything about you. I just want
this to be over.</p>
<p><strong>dora</strong>: Ray saw Mr. Stockton making all this money
blackmailing people at the club. When he found out who was interested in
me… he said it would be so easy. We’d never have to work again.</p>
<p><strong>dora</strong>: We’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen, it looks like things didn’t turn out
the way you planned, but I think all Stockton wants is his pictures
back. As soon as he gets them I bet-</p>
<p><strong>ray e</strong>: Stockton’s pictures? You.think they’re
Stockton’s pictures?</p>
<p>****: You really have no idea what you’ve gotten into, do you? BOOM!
The window SHATTERS and Ray and Phil hit the deck. As Ray starts blindly
firing back, Phil crawls on his knees and elbows across the floor toward
the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m OK! I’m OK! Ray spots Phil crawling away
and gets up, turning to him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey! Get- Suddenly, Ray is SHOT IN THE ARM
through the window. He drops to the ground in pain, yelling and
clutching his arm.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ahh!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh God! Are you hit?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No… just… a little … winded… that… crawling’s…
tough… on the core…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How about you guys let me in before someone
gets really hurt?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dammit! Frank eyes Dora, then SHOOTS HER IN
THE FOOT, sending screaming to the ground in pain.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You stay put. He hurries back through the
house.</p>
<p><strong>front of run down house - continuous</strong>: Phil and Clara
sprint to the street as a BUICK pulls up in front and a confused looking
CHUBBY GUY steps</p>
<p><strong>chubby guy</strong>: Hey? Which is 357 Maple Street?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re Dora’s brother?</p>
<p><strong>chubby guy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re late!</p>
<p><strong>chubby guy</strong>: OK sorry! The roads are all screwed with
all this construction- BOOM! They wince as a SHOT hits the rearview
mirror of the car. All three spin to see Frank aiming his gun and
marching toward them, Harry right behind him.</p>
<p><strong>chubby guy</strong>: Hey! Phil quickly pushes Dora’s brother
aside as he and Clara hop into the Buick and PEEL OUT.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil! Careful! Phil WHIPS the car around
another bend.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Please, Phil! It’s not going to do any good
if you-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Clara! Please! Just leave the driving to me,
OK?!? I know what I’m- SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING
the windshield. Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They’re
face to face - nose to nose - with another broken windshield. In the
driver’s seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG
BLACK DUDE • stares at them in shock.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: No no no. Tell me you did not just do
that.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Shit! The Black Dude gets out of his car to
inspect, head in hands.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Oh, man! You did not just do that! Whew,
you gonna be payin’ for this!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: owe you one. Phil throws the car into reverse,
but his tires just screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place. Looking
out his window toward the front, Phil sees that</p>
<p>**ashed front grill of the black dude’s honda. _-m**: The Black Dude
comes toward him.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Oh no no no. You’re gonna get outta this
car and hand me over a license and some insurance. We gonna do this
right. Man, I think I got whiplash and shit. A SCREECH. Phil looks back
to see FRANK AND HARRY’S TOTnNCAR coming around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Shit. Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car
and hops into the Black Dude’s souped up Honda.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Hey! HEY! What do you think you’re
doing? The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver’s door, but
Phil’s LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? That’s insane!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Frank and Harry’s car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It
will smash into them in seconds…</p>
<p><strong>i know it is! but do it!</strong>: Freaked, Clara hops to the
driver’s seat and switches to reverse, and guns it. At the same moment,
Phil steps on the gas. The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver’s door,
SCREAMS as he’s THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY SHAMMY
BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The Black Dude scrambles
for his life through the windshield into the passenger’s seat next to
Phil.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil, this is-</p>
<p><strong>and you! cut the jesus!</strong>: Mumbling angrily, Clara
puts her car in drive and steps on it. Their cars lurch then burn
asphalt as the wheels smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They
race past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in pursuit.
Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their conjoined cars down
the middle of the street, but he and Clara are out of sync and their
attached cars veer :ildly back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle
and -JcK DOWN a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h–’-s v;:-reel,
getting them back into the street.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Just let me out, OK? You can have it!
1�1 You can have it!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m not yelling! I’m just talking in an very
animated voice! Looking back over his shoulder again, Phil sees they’re
approaching the lar ge intersection with Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, now when I say so, spin your wheel!</p>
<p><strong>now!</strong>: On his command, Clara spins her wheel sharply
to t1- right., but it’s the wrong way and their cars JACK across the
road. An ONCOMING SUV honks desperately.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? You just said spin the wheel, Phil! You
didn’t say which way.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes I did!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No you didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: She’s right! You di</p>
<p>****: God! Thank you! Can we take him home? I need him! Both Phil and
the Black Dude sees that the Towncar’s turned onto Michigan Avenue and
is still right behind E them.</p>
<p><strong>black dud</strong>: Aw man!</p>
<p>****: I say our best chance is to reverse again, then use both
engines to floor as fast as we can all the way down Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Why stay on Michigan?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why stay on Michigan? Because it’s a wider
street.</p>
<p><strong>lara</strong>: It’s also a busier street! I think it would be
better to try to branch off.</p>
<p>****: Why do you have a problem with every route I take? Flustered,
Phil turns to the Black Dude next to him to commiserate, unaware that
his STEERING WHEEL DRIFTS.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: She does this wherever we go! Every time! Phil
doesn’t notice the LIGHTS GROWING BRIGHTER behind him..</p>
<p><strong>phil!</strong>: LOUD HONNNNNNNKKKKKK. Phil and the Black Dude
look over their shoulders to see they’re heading straight for a</p>
<p><strong>ahhhh!</strong>: Phil SPINS the wheel sharply and they go
SIDEWAYS, jumping the curb and soaring into MILLENNIUM PARK. In their
car following them, Frank and Harry’s -mouths drop.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight put your
foot to the floor. Give it everything! Clara reverses and Phil puts the
car in drive and floors it. The car goes faster… faster…</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Oooh. I really woulc_n.’t be doing that.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Doing what? What are you doing?!? Clara
glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai toward a CONCRETE
STAIRWAY.</p>
<p><strong>cl.</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Just trust me! The conjoined cars HIT the
steps and their wheels SMOKE as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE
WAY UP THE</p>
<p><strong>stairway!</strong>: The Towncar tries the follow them, but
its single engine doesn’t have enough power. Swearing under his breath,
Frank reverses back down the steps.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man.
Wicked. They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil, the
WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: • Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: s cool.</p>
<p>****: They’re back. They peek again over their shoulders. The
Towncar’s driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Jesus! What the hell are you guys in
trouble for?</p>
<p>****: f i ght… you name it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Can we just try to work together at this?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m not blaming you. Please? Clara nods.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now whatever direction I give you, take your
normal version of it and tone it down like 85 percent, OK?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: 35 percent. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK. Small left. Now!</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel
slightly lefts They ZOOM around the corner.</p>
<p>****: Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara! Now give me a medium
right. Do it! She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another
street.</p>
<p><strong>claa</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Now we’re cooking with fire! Now tiny
le</p>
<p>****: You act it! They make the slightest turn.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes! No.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS
FLASH as a BARRIER comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is
slowly rising. Phil looks behind - the Towncar’s got them closed in. The
Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: say we can pop you guys up and over.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Excuse me? What are you talking about, “pop
you guys up and over?”</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: You climb over, then we both reverse it
and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you flying over the top.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control
of the car back to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the
drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE WINDSHIELD TO THE
OTHER, sitting next to Clara.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil, don’t even think of it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: can do it. Clara.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: No, Phil. We can’t! It’s suicide!</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Here we go now… One… two… THREE!</p>
<p><strong>ahhhh!</strong>: The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in
opposite directions, then DISLODGE. Phil and Clara’s car flies reverse
UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE… .and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY
OF SPARKS OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around
Phil and Clara. The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing
his Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank and Harry’s
eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but the Towncar CRASHES right
into the Honda. ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank and
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>black dude</strong>: Hope you all got insurance. Hitting a
button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on his Honda.</p>
<p>****: We did it! We did it! A DOOR SLAM. Phil moves an air bag aside
to see Clara MARCHING AWAY down the street.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I want to make sure that at least one our
son’s parents survives tonight!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You almost just got us killed!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I see. I almost got us killed. Forget about
the people chasing and shooting at us all night long because of the
reservation you stole.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: There’s a difference between fleeing from
people shooting at you and knowingly driving a car in reverse over an
open drawbridge!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Unbelievable! You know, all you complain about
is that I don’t take risks anymore. Then the second I do, you get mad at
me for doing it! I can’t win with you!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don’t you!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, you have no idea! Every single day from
the moment we wake up you’re bossy, • disapproving, inconsiderate-</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m inconsiderate? I’M INCONSIDERATE?!? Have
you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after Tsunami Phil’s blown
through? The floor! The sink! You use my toothbrush.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s the difference? Afraid you’re gonna get
my cooties?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me! And
how many years have I asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet
paper in right?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen to yourself! You have problems with how
I pqt in the toilet paper!</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: Because under makes no sense, Phil! Under makes
no sense! When it’s under it doesn’t pull off right! It just keeps
spinning and spinning and doesn’t cascade properly!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: After ten years of asking you to have roll
the right way, you still can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, how about the fact that I have not woken
up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears! You steal the
whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? Phil, I do not “steal” the comforter.
It just happens when we’re-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Bulls Bull-shit.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Don’t you point that at me!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don’t think
I don’t!</p>
<p>****: You wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then
reeeeel it in so I can’t pull it at all.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I do not leg lock the comforter!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh yes you do!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: u think I don’t know your little icks? Where
you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in
the fridge so you don’t have to be the one to “finish” it and replace
it?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re right. I do that. You know why do that,
Clara?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Because you don’t want to haul your ass to
the market to buy it yourself!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Because I’m afraid to! God forbid I the wrong
kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath! You’re
like the Nutrition Nazi.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And I’ve got to be your little Nutrition Nazi
Goebbels because we have to be this “united front” with Ollie! What’s
wrong if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar instead of one? Or if his
handwriting isn’t perfect? Or if he goes to school for one day not
dressed like Finneas J. Nerdo!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I must be
hard having to be the cool fun parent while I get to be the one who
makes sure our child’s fed, clothed and</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How would you even know? You don’t give me or
anyone else a chance! You’re so goddamn controlling! You’ve got to be
Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line, looking down on them from her
fancy Wonder Woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder
superpowers! You paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being
the superlady!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Urgh! You know w sometimes I don’t pay
attention to you, Phil? Because you give me a headache! Clara angrily
rummages through her purse then lets out a frustrated sigh.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse? How could
it be? Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil’s head. He ducks and the
contents spill all over the road.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Screw you, Phil!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I survive
tonight I’m screwed all around anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with my
job!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What are you talking about, screwed with your
job?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a
new brilliant plan for the fund so George wouldn’t take it over
tomorrow. Doesn’t look like that’s gonna happen!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know, Clara. Maybe because I didn’t
want you chiming in on how Mr. Rivers was right. He wants the new guy
for all the reasons you complain about me! Someone who doesn’t “play it
safe.” Someone who’ll “take a risk.”</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I can’t believe that’s what you think do.</p>
<p><strong>phi</strong>: Yeah, well…</p>
<p>****: You know, when you set up this whole “magical” night, in that
dress… I got this glimmer that it was going to be like it used to be
with us. But… I don’t know. I guess we’re just not those people
anymore.</p>
<p>****: I guess we’re not. Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away
do– the street. Clara, trying to hold it together, h and starts to
gather the items from her purse something catches his eye. She picks up
the ENVELOPE that Dora put in her bag.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think we said all needs to be said right
now, Clara. Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: This… this… this…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: Side cramp… Wow. She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends
down, trying to stop her cramp. Confused, Phil opens it and looks at the
pictures inside. His brow furrows.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What is it? Clara looks over his shoulder,
shakes her head and TURNS THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil’s eyes
go wide.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh jeez. It’s… it’s…</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: It’s the Mayor. Phil looks at Clara, taking it
all in.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I bet this didn’t have anything to do with
Stockton at first.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The Mayor must have gone to Stockton’s club
one night. He saw Dora working there and obviously gave some sign that
he was interested.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: So much for “Mr. Squeaky Clea</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and
convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and
blackmail him.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: They knew it was an election year and he
would have to pay them whatever they asked.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But somehow Stockton found out about the
photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: So he sent his guys to the restaurant to
intercept the Gales and get the photos.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed
before the Mayor even had a chance to show up. Phil thinks. He snaps his
fingers.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If we could find some way to get in touch with
the mayor directly, without anyone else knowing, there actually might be
a way out of this for us. Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to
her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: can.</p>
<p><strong>doorman building - later that night</strong>: Phil and Clara
walk into the lobby of the doorman building and start toward the
elevator, straight past the</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Whoa whoa whoa. Where do you you’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh, we’re guests of Apartment 605 The Doorman
picks up the phone to call the apartmen</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: And you are? looks at him in shock.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Are you crazy? It’s 4 in the morning! We were
lust out for dinner. Trust me</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: I’m not really allowed to just let you up
there.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Please. Just look at us! The Doorman looks at
Phil and Clara - a white, well dressed suburban couple.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: OK. Yeah. Go ahead. The elevator door opens
and they get inside.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Have a nice night.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: As the elevator doors close, Phil and
Clara look at each other, then simultaneously slip PAPER BAGS with EYE
and MOUTH HOLES over their heads.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: All right. All- As Mrs. Cardigan
opens the door, Phil and Clara, in their masks, BUM RUSH her. Screaming,
Cardigan dodges, running back to her desk. Phil and Clara give chase,
but Cardigan grabs a LARGE METAL YARDSTICK and starts WHOPPING PHIL over
and over on his paper bag head, screaming the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>ow! ow! ow!</strong>: Clara grabs her from behind, bringing
her down.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I can’t find any rope. Only yarn.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yarn? Fine. Just use that. I’ll start
looking. Phil gets to work, wrapping the yarn over and over, tying
Cardigan’s arms to the back of the chair, while Clara searches
Cardigan’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: You two weren’t very prepared.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: You should have been more prepared. Thought ahead
and brought the rope you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: OK, why don’t you lay off the critiqu</p>
<p><strong>mrs. card—‘–’</strong>: ’s not a critique. It’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh is it a fact?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardiga?</strong>: Yes. ng word choice.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wrong word choice? Unbelievable! Well, let me
throw a little word choice “correction” your way.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Partner!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Five year old kids can’t be
“antagonistic.”</p>
<p><strong>partne</strong>: Phil looks over. Clara makes the “Cut it
out” gesture across her throat.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: If you’re done tying her up, come over and
help. Phil crosses the room and starts going through notebooks on the
desk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: The name’s Cardigan, not Rockefeller,
if you haven’t figured it out yet! What idiots!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You must be such a positive influence on our
youth.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: You’re one to talk!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Partner!</p>
<p>****: 1�1 Listen, lady, just sit tight and we’ll be out of here
before you know it. Phil picks up and flips quickly through a notebook,
when he spots something and doubles back, starting to read. His brow
furrows. Clara, deep in her own workbook, suddenly brightens.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Got it! She notices Phil’s expression.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What? hands the book to Clara to read. She
does and darkens.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oliver told her he’s being mean to Je y
Briggs because… he says he wants to marry her?</p>
<p>****: And that’s what married people do.</p>
<p>****: What’s wrong over there? No “crown jewels” yet?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Let’s make the call,</p>
<p>****: Lucy? Is everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Lucy? Who’s Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: I’m Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You and the Mayor are on a first name
basis?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardigan</strong>: You’re calling our Mayor in the
middle of the night?</p>
<p>****: I had nothing to do with this Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Charlie?!? Lucy!?!? _ appened to “°boundaries
matter?„ =_.h? What happened to that, bitch?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey “partner.” How about you put a sock in it
now.</p>
<p>****: Who is this ? r1</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You don’t know me, Mr. Mayor, but I’ve
recently come into possession of something that you were supposed to get
from the Gales tonight. Silence on the line.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p>****: And?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And whether you realize it or not, we ended up
doing you a favor. You see, this man named Mr. Stockton - I know if you
know him-</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: I know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well, he tried to steal the photos from the
Gales. He’s even got cops on his payroll helping him out. We think he
was planning to sabotage your re-election.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: So what do you want for them?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What do we want? Phil looks at Clara.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We just want our lives back. We want to go
home, Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s it. Mayor Diggs breathes out and rubs
his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs e</strong>: If you really can get me… what I was
supposed to receive earlier without this getting out, I promise you I’ll
take care of your safety.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But now the police think that-</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: Trust me. Get me the photos and he
won’t be bothering you again.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: is it? Phil’s concentrating hard on
something. Thinking.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh… yeah. We’ll meet you at the Adler
Planetarium in 1 hour. Come alone. E</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: Of course. And… thank you. Click. The
Mayor hangs up the phone and quietly leaves the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: We dodged a bullet. They calac _e .</p>
<p><strong>stockton</strong>: interesting. ON STOCKTON’S MONITOR in
front of him we see that Frank and Harry hold a wounded Ray and Dora in
the meat locker.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: They thought you were stealing the
photos from the Gales to try to blackmail me yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: Did they, now? That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: They’re going to meet me in an hour
with them. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: st keeps getting better.</p>
<p><strong>adler planetarium - later</strong>: Phil and Clara sit
silently on the steps of the beautiful, old Alder Planetarium looking at
dawn hitting the CHICAGO SKYLINE.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Man, I love this city. Always have.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: When was the last time we watched the sunrise
together?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Probably the last time we were here.</p>
<p>****: Nope. it wasn’t. It was the morning that Ollie was born.</p>
<p>****: You’re The morning Ollie was born. They look at each other,
remembering.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Man, I’m starving!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p>****: Sorry you never got your truffles.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Clara reaches into her purse.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Who needs white truffles when you’ve got a
lemon zest Luna bar. Clara breaks it in two and hands half to Phil. They
click the halves together, toasting each other, then silently chew,
looking out. Phil shakes his head and starts GIGGLING.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: OK, what happened to us tonight? the hell are we doing here?
Clara starts laughing too.</p>
<p><strong>claira</strong>: It’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, I know it’s not funny. It’s not funny at
all.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: en why are you laughing?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why are you laughing? They’re both cracking
up… then Phil notices a moment later that Clara’s laughter has turned
to</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Wha e gonna be OK, Cla</p>
<p><strong>clp–p, a</strong>: No. It’s not that. just… this is nice.
Right now. You don’t understand… I really don’t want to be Wonder Woman,
Phil! I don’t At all!</p>
<p>****: You don’t see that this whole time I’m flying in a glass plane!
In a glass Mane!</p>
<p>****: Uh, OK, but I think Wonder Woman actua flies an invisible
plane, not a glass plane.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You see! It isn’t even there at all! I don’t
even have a plane! No plane! I’m running on fumes!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You’re not running on fumes, Clara.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I’m not trying to be uptight, or controlling!
Or a nutrition…</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Nazi.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Nazi! I’m just trying the only way I know how
to keep everything from fall apart!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It won’t fall apart. And I really can help
whenever you feel like it is. With Ollie. Whatever. You just never act
like you need me to.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: That’s because as it is you see us as a
distraction from your work!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You think I see you guys as a distraction? God
no, Clara.</p>
<p>****: You don’t understand… I have this wife who does everything
better than anyone I’ve ever known. And the greatest son. You want to
know why I obsess so much about my stupid job? Because I want to feel
like… like I can do something good enough to deserve someone like you. I
mean, I look at you and I jest don’t stack up.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: That’s crazy, Phil. You do. You’re a god man.
You’re the best man I know.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll never be the guy who remembers always put
toilet paper on the right way.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: I don’t think I would really want to be with
that guy, Phil. I just… want us to be on the same team again. As Clara
sniffles, Phil takes this in for a beat. He nods.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Listen, you know what I said before, about not
being the people we used to be?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Phil, we were angry-</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, Clara. It’s true. We’re not. And I know
I’m going to drive you crazy again, and you’re definitely going to drive
me crazy. But I wouldn’t want to do it with anybody else. He hugs her
tight.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We had a good fight tonight, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Yeah, we did. You know the worst part about
not talking about all this recently?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: We missed out on a lot of make up sex. And
our make up sex woulda rocked!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oh yeah. Phil s when he spots something
behind Clara. MAYOR DIGGS looks both walks from his car in the parking
lot toward the–.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p>****: Tell me now. Do you need to pee?</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: 1 hold it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is what you’re looking for. I’ve tten
down our information inside.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: And that’s it?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s it. We’re going home now. The Mayor
nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him toward the parking lot.
Mayor Diggs stays behind, nervously tapping the envelope in his hand. As
Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR’S CAR DOORS OPEN,
and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr. Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry
pop the trunk and grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil’s eyes go wide.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh God. Run, Clara! Phil and Clara start to
run, when a GUNSHOT hits the ground in front of them. They turn, when
ANOTHER SHOT rings out.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: The next one won’t be a warning
shot. They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and Stockton
walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with the plastic.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: Let’s do it over there. y and Frank
quickly throw the plastic sheets down on the grass nearby.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: I’m going to wait in the c r don’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking
lot, he opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and Clara
to walk to the plastic sheets.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Please. Please don’t do</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Please! We have a child!</p>
<p><strong>’vt mining</strong>: said over there!</p>
<p>****: Just me then, OK? I promise you she’s not going to say
anything! Please! We have a child!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: Last time I’m going to say it.
Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then walk to stand in
front of the plastic on the ground.</p>
<p>****: On your knees. Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She
takes looking back at him and they kneel in front of the plastic, side
by side. Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his
gun.</p>
<p><strong>what the</strong>: Mr. Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn.
Mayor Diggs sifts through pages of DOCJ J:TTS that were in t h ’’w Wila
Envelope.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: -eally were planning to give you the pictures,
Mr. Mayor. That is, until you -.sre so casual about is not needing to
worry about the cop who was after us. That made me a little suspicious
because I never told you which cop it was.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Then we got to talking and realized how dumb
we were.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: E If you came on to some waitress at the
Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn comfortable there.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Which meant Stockton was probably your
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: Where are the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: But we were still confused, because if you
guys are buddies, how do you explain the Falconwood Corporation?
Mr. Stockton’s face blanches.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: They’re obviously not going to tell
us! Just shoot them!</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: Wait. I’ve heard that name. What’s the
Falconwood Corporation?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Runs the hiring of inspectors for the
Department of Highways in Chicago. You</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: Manning! I said shoot them!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant manning</strong>: I work for the Mayor,
Terrence.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: Why do you keep interrupting,
Terrence?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Maybe because according to the paperwork
you’ve got there, he owns Falconwood.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Not only that, you’ll see those other pages
that he also owns a cc=rpany called Eurostruct - which rents the city
all of its construction equipment.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: Frank, Harry! Frank and Harry reach
for their guns, but Manning turns his gun on them.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The more violations Falconwood finds, the
longer Eurostruct rents the equipment. That turns into big bucks,
Mr. Mayor. I’m sure that’s not a moral problem for you, but he’s kind of
screwing you in an election year, isn’t he? Some of us are pretty pissed
off about the roads. Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it
all</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: You did this to me? I don’t get it,
Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I have the Lieutenant here watch
your back on all of your gambling clubs-</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: Oh, do you mean the ones that you
gamble at? Where I cover your debts? Those clubs?</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: I slipped your company 5 no-bid
foreclosed buildings for a dollar each downtown.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton •</strong>: You think that pays for what I do
for you? The girls I have to pay off? The jet charters? And let’s not
even get into your “re-election fund”! Let’s not even go there!</p>
<p>****: Listen to them. Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of
his jacket pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>mr. stockton</strong>: How did you get this? How?</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Tha be from me. Mr. Stockton and others
turn around to see HOLBROOKE P_IF SON, brandi= –.g his gun and looking
like the FBI he always -t e_’ to be, leap -= a pack of Cher AGEN=IS as
they JT OF THE L ’<em>:I T”</em> : RIU?</p>
<p><strong>holerook e</strong>: FBI! Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy.
With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the WIRES under their
clothing. Seeing them hand over the wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor
Diggs what he’s just revealed.</p>
<p><strong>mayor diggs</strong>: Aw fuck.</p>
<p>****: Makes you feel any better, I wasn’t gonna vote for you
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: either.</p>
<p><strong>� clara</strong>: Everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Yeah. They just need me downtown in half
an hour for a news conference with the Deputy Mayor. Want it for the
morning shows.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t think they’re going to be calling you
the IT guy any-more.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: Listen guys, I feel weird about not even
acknowledging you two.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>holbrooke</strong>: But you should be up there with me. You
handed this whole case to me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, well-, that’s how we roll. They get out
of the car and start up the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>chaz</strong>: Hey hey! Up bright and early, aren Phil looks
over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in his jogging suit. He
smiles, appreciating Chaz for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yep. We sure are. As he joins Clara on the
doorstep, they take each other in.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: You have your presentation in a few
hours.</p>
<p>****: Yeah. You know, I think I’m gonna be OK.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah. Me too. It was fun.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: It was.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: So… let’s do this again sometime?</p>
<p>****: like that. For the first time the whole night, THEY KISS.
Interlocking fingers, they head inside, closing their front door behind
them.</p>
