<p><strong>music in</strong>: “Stone Cold Dead in the Market” by Louis
Jordon</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It’s a
thrill to be standing here talking to you wonderful people. In fact,
it’s a thrill to be standing! I haven’t seen so many people since my
last fight at Madison Square Garden. After that fight, a reporter asked
me, ‘Jake, where do you go from here?’ I said, ‘To a hospital!’ I fought
one hundred and six professional fights and still none of them bums
figured out how to fight me – they kept hitting me in the head! And
that’s why I’m here tonight… ‘When the fighter’s not engaged in his
employment, his employment, although he was Champ and quite the rage, he
must go somewhere else to seek employment, seek employment. But a
fighter’s life is not a bowl of cherries, still I’d rather have an egg
than a fist upon my face… That’s Entertainment!’</p>
<p><strong>and in the ring</strong>: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water
and spits blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for
him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You didn’t have to come to Cleveland to get
beat by a “moulan yan,” Jake!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: He’s got you, Jake! You’re outpointed! You’re
coming up for the tenth. You gotta knock him out!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: A grand apiece! We got a grand apiece on this,
Jake! A fucking grand!</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: One, two, three, four…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner, under
the rules of the Cleveland Boxing Commission, after ten rounds, by a
decision – Jimmy Reeves.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Don’t get out of the ring. You won the fight –
let him go out first.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let’s say
that’s the truck; it’s full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o’clock this
morning we move the truck from here to there,</p>
<p>****: take the cigarettes out, sell ’em, make some cash.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Hey but Joey, you’re thinking nickels and
dimes. The money’s with your brother.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What do you want from my life, Salvy? He’s my
brother.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: He ain’t doin’ the right thing. He’s makin’
beans compared to what he should be makin’. Can’t you make him
understand that?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hey, leave the kids alone.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Get lost. Hey kids, “A cop is a rat.”
Remember that, “A rat.”</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hey Jimmy, here’s a dollar for your trouble.
There’s some bums around the corner – they need your help.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself a new
suit.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Here’s my new suit. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey, don’t get wise!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Just kidding, take it easy. No fuckin’ sense
of humor.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This looks done.</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: It’s not done.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It looks done. I’ll take it the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: Here’s your steak. You can’t wait for it to be
done. Here.</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: Here’s your carrots. You’re in such a hurry.
You can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, I can’t wait. You know when I wait? When
it’s important to wait. It’s not important to wait for no steak. It’s
important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain’t important to
wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that
way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier,
sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Wait! I’ll wait. But let me tell you, if this
steak was the middleweight championship, I’d show you how I’d wait. I’d
eat it raw. I’d drink the blood. I’d eat it before it came out of the
cow – that’s how I’d wait.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I can’t convince him. He’s got such a thick
head, I’d like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It’s
very hard. You don’t have to convince me – I know we should be with
Tommy. You talk to him. He don’t listen to nobody.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Look, I’m just tellin’ you how Tommy feels.
Jake is makin’ it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It’s as
simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Talk some sense into him, will ya? You’re
still his brother. If he ain’t gonna listen to you, he ain’t gonna
listen to nobody!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: All right, I’ll try. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Tomorrow, at the gym. Don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Right, the gym.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: He’s doing it again.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’s the matter? You’re drinking. You’re
eating like an animal.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Nothing…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hey, c’mon, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I ain’t ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that’s
what’s the matter.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’re you talking about? He’s a heavyweight.
You’re a middleweight.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look at these hands. These fuckin’ hands. I
was born with a girl’s hands. And even if I put on enough weight to be a
heavyweight, I’d be too slow to fight. No matter how big I get, I’ll
never be big enough to fight Louis.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: That’s what I’m sayin’. You shouldn’t even
think like that. It’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I tell you one thing. Ok, I’ll never be big
enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You know?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. Do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Sure. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hit me in the face.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You want me to do what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You heard me, I said hit me.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: C’mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go ahead. I ain’t drunk. Take your best shot.
On the jaw.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jack, I got no gloves.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Here’s your glove.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go ahead. Hit me. C’mon, don’t worry about it.
I want you to hit me with everything you got.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Again. Harder.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Harder. Go ’head.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Harder. Take the towel off.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jack! Enough!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What was that for? I know you can take
punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that
prove?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: See that, I don’t feel it. I can take it. I
know I can take anybody.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Hey Joey –</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Jake, how you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Did you know they were coming up here?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Answer me when I talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you.
So I…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t ever bring those kids up here again! I’m
working out, I’m killin’ myself in here, and they walk around like they
fuckin’ own the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Hey Joey, we better go. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go ’head. Wave goodbye. They’re your
friends.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And that hard-on, Salvy. Who’s he think he is?
I’m gonna let that fuckin’ hard-on come up here and act like a big
shot.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What are you getting so hot about – Tommy Como
told him to come down here…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, I don’t care about Tommy Como. I don’t
care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin’ cross. I gotta give them a
percentage of what I make! I’m in here breaking my ass, not them. Don’t
ever bring them up here again.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I didn’t tell them to come. Tommy Como…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right, fight back. I got laid three
times before I came up here this morning and I can still break your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>fan</strong>: Hey, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake’s p.o.v.</strong>: JOEY is talking to VICKIE. VICKIE
giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Whadda you care?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she?
What’s a matter? You afraid I’m gonna take her on you?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: No, I’m not afraid. Why? You wanna meet
her?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Cause I’ll go right over there and bring her
here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go ’head.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You sure you wanna meet her? Don’t make me go
over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she’s
really a knockout. She’s 15, this kid – a great piece of ass.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How do you know? You know her that good?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I
know her like that – not like that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Nah, not now… I wanna wait. I don’t feel
right…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m tellin’ you, she’ll be there, I know
she’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: ’Cause I wanna catch her alone.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?…
I don’t know if she’ll be there alone… She’ll probably be there with her
girlfriends or something.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She ever go with them? Like Salvy?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Nah, she don’t go with nobody. She’s only 15
years old.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What does that have to do with it? She don’t
look 15 to me. I heard somethin’ with Salvy. She was with him once or
somethin’, I think. It was like some blonde. That’s the one…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and
not just him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, she’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Ah, some piece of ass, I’m tellin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You wasn’t with her, were you?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You wasn’t with her?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: With her? How?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know, like bang her or anything?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Ah, no, no. I didn’t bang her. I know her from
around here, that’s all. You want to meet her or what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Nah, not now – all those hard-ons around. I’ll
wait. Not now.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m tellin’ you, she’ll be there, I know
she’ll be there. Dressed up and everything.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t like all those other clowns around.
That’s all I know.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: C’mon, hurry up. We’re never gonna get outa
here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: Where you going at this hour?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’re you, a cop? I’m goin’ out –
business.</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: You fuckin’ worm, if you’re going out, I’m
going out.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: None of your fuckin’ business.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Eh, go out. Do what you’re gonna do. What do I
care?</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: That’s right – run out. I ain’t gonna be here
when you get back.</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: Bunch of guys. You all hang out together.
Yeah, you’re all going out on business. You’re all gonna suck each other
off.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What a mouth on her – you shoulda hit her – no
good fuckin’ Jewish cunt – breakin’ our balls. You shoulda hit her with
a chair.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, watch your mouth. Don’t talk like that.
She’s still my wife.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: No, but Jake… how much abuse can you take.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her
enough.</p>
<p><strong>irma</strong>: Go ahead – that’s all you’re good for – to go
out and leave me here like a dog. You and your brother! You don’t even
look like brothers. You look like faggots! That’s what you look like –
faggots!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Look, could you move a little. Would you mind,
darling?</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Mind what, Mr. Big Shot?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Eh, girlie, take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: All right, darling, I’ll just stand here and
wait.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do you see her yet?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Give me a chance. Let me look.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: THERE she is over there on the other side.
What did I tell you? Oh, ain’t she nice? Ain’t she a fuckin’ doll?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hey, Vickie, c’mere. Don’t be afraid. C’mere.
Just say hello. This is my brother.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Vickie, I want you to meet my brother, Jake.
He’s gonna be the next champ.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that
right? You wanted to meet me?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I just wanted to say hello.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You wanted to say hello, eh? I can’t believe
it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you’re the most
beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at
mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I don’t know. ’Cause you’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute?
Hey, whatcha doin’ now? You wanna go for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Sure. Gimme a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You don’t talk very much.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I ain’t ever talked to a movie star
before.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I ain’t no movie star. I’m just in high
school.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake! The bus!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Any bus gives you trouble, I knock it out for
ya.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You go first. Let me watch how to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You don’t get nothin’ done by watchin’. You
just gotta do it. Here, I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s it. Just grip up a little tighter.
That’s it. You’re gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: It feels real good.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just keep your eye on the ball.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Should I hit it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just give it a nice little tap.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I can’t find my ball.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Can you see it?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Can you see it?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It means the game is over.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let’s get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi Pop. This is my new girlfriend, Vickie. V
for victory. How do you like that Pop?</p>
<p><strong>joe lamotta</strong>: V for victory.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: It’s a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. LaMotta.</p>
<p><strong>joe lamotta</strong>: Sit down. Eat something.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: C’mon, Pop. You’ve been in America so many
years. Speak English.</p>
<p><strong>joe lamotta</strong>: You want me to speak English – Fuck
you. That’s English.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Pop, don’t curse. There’s a girl here. I’m
gonna show her around the house. Why don’t you just finish your
wine?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake, this is your father’s bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s all right. He don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>time cut</strong>: THE ANNOUNCER calls out that JAKE is the
winner. JAKE throws kisses. The CROWD goes wild.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: The fuckin’ papers are full of Robinson and
nothing on Jake – and Jake knocked him clear outa the ring in Detroit.
He’s the only guy ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa matter with you? I
thought we had an arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: We do Joey. You know we do.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You holding me up for more cash or what?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I can’t print nothing if Jake won’t give
me nothing.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: C’mon, Jake. You’re makin’ us look stupid. I
brought these guys up here, now you don’t wanna talk to them? What are
ya doin’? Open your mouth, for Christsake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m tallin’ you now, when I read this, it
better not make me look bad.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Jake, did I ever make you look bad
before?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Maybe it wasn’t you, but you know what I’m
talkin’ about.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Don’t worry. Don’t worry. It’s gonna be all
right. Ask him your questions.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: All right, Jake, you’re being talked about
as the top middleweight contender. Do you think another victory over
Sugar Ray will get you a shot at the title?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why not? There’s nobody else around who wants
to fight me; they’re all afraid. I don’t see why I shouldn’t have a shot
at the title right now.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Well, the word is to get a title shot you
have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And
they’re saying that you don’t cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You guys know more about that than I do. I
just fight…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: He fights the toughest guys around that
everybody else is afraid to fight…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I
still don’t have a shot at the title.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago
and you’re training like this right now… Are you afraid Sugar Ray might
beat you this time?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray
hits me here. I can’t tell the difference. I just fight.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Are you sure we should be doing this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come over here.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You said never to touch you before a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If you let me do it, I’ll murder you. Come
here.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You said I couldn’t. You’ve been good for
two weeks…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Take off my pants.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do what I say.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now take the rest off.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake, you made me promise not to get you
excited.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go ’head. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I like the gym smell.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now take your panties off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Now, touch me… … here.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Oh, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I can’t do it. I can’t fool around. This
Robinson, I gotta beat him again. I can’t fool around. Don’t come near
me.</p>
<p><strong>the fourth round</strong>: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR
RAY knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and lefts.
JAKE is punched all the way across the ring, but stays in there.</p>
<p><strong>the seventh round</strong>: JAKE, coming on strong, forces
SUGAR RAY into his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin. SUGAR
RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however, the blow does not
have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY; instead, he comes back and
outboxes JAKE.</p>
<p><strong>time cut</strong>: THE ANNOUNCER calls out the decision:
SUGAR RAY is the winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for
so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the fighters in the
next bout.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: They robbed us! Those fuckin’ judges – What
the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I’ll
break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin’ ass! Those judges give
him the decision ’cause he’s goin in the army next week! How else could
this have happened?… What do you think they gave him the decision for,
that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down.
What did I do wrong? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You won and was robbed! You didn’t do nothin’
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I dunno. Maybe I don’t deserve to win. I’ve
done a lot of bad things. I dunno…</p>
<p><strong>joye</strong>: Fuck that. This was the fight. This coulda
done it. This was our shot. They out and out robbed us.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: Vickie is here, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t wanna see nobody.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You want us to wait for you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a
while. Everybody go.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I just weighed myself - I’m 161. No more deals
like this Janiro bullshit. I didn’t tell you to do it in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jake, you’re the one who said you could get
down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin’ hat?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, sometimes you shouldn’t listen to me!
Now I don’t know if I can make it down to 155. I’m having trouble making
160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and
if I don’t make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You’re supposed to know what
you’re doin’. You’re supposed to be a manager!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You want the title shot?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Say what you’re gonna say.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You want the title shot or not?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Say what you gotta say. Don’t be a smart
ass.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: This Janiro’s an up-and-coming fighter, this
kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin’ kid! I’m telling you,
this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I’m
telling you. You been killin’ yourself for three years. There’s nobody
left – they’re afraid to fight you. This Janiro’s up-and-coming. He
don’t know. Fuckin’ tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried
about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they’re gonna think you’re
weak; they’re gonna think you’re not the fighter you used to be. They’ll
match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then
you’ll kill them and you’ll get your title shot. And if you beat this
kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there’s
nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own – just like
you want it. All right?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Joey’s right. Janiro’s up-and coming, he’s
good looking…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean, “good looking?”</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Well, he’s popular. A lotta people like
Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they’ll wanna see you get a
title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I
should…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who asked you?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: But, Jake, I was just…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who asked you?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I was just…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who asked you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All right, manager. Everybody had their say
around here. Now this is what I’m gonna say. I’m gonna get down to 155,
and I’m gonna destroy this kid – get my title shot. And don’t ever bet
15 thousand without my sayso again.</p>
<p><strong>comedian</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to point
out a special guest we have with us tonight – The Raging Bull, The Bronx
Bull, Mr. Jake LaMotta.</p>
<p><strong>comedian</strong>: Stand up, Jake, c’mon. Oh, you are
standing. Sorry. Just kiddin’, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look at this abuse I gotta take.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s so funny? Cheers! Post-time. Joey,
Vickie, and… What’s your name again, darling?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Janet.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin’? Vickie…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’re you lookin’ at? You lookin’ at
him?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: No, I’m not. I’m looking at you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t tell me “No.” I saw you lookin’ at him.
Why, you like him?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I’m not interested in him.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re not interested in him?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: In other words, you’re not interested in him
but you’d be interested in somebody else, right?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake, c’mon now. Don’t start.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look at this, all of a sudden everybody’s a
fuckin’ Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin’ at
him?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Nah, she would never…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Didn’t you just see her lookin’ at him? She
told me no, but I don’t believe her.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: C’mon, Jake. You know she’s crazy about
you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’d just love to catch her. Oooooh, I’d just
love to catch her once.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: These are from Tommy Como.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t be long. I’m afraid with all these tough
guys here.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jake, come over for a few minutes. Tommy wants
to say hello to you. C’mon, just come and say hello.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: COMO’s table. JAKE comes over.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi, Tommy. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jake, sit down for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fuckin’ kid! You’re the best fuckin’ fighter
around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them “moulan yans” – forget
about it. They’re all afraid to fight you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: C’mon, Tommy –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How you feelin’? Ok? You feelin’ good?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Never felt better.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tony Janiro’s gotta watch out, eh?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He should.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This Janiro’s a good fiahter, pretty
good-lookin’ kid.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Bet on him three times. Always come through
for me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How’s the weight? Ok?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, the weight’s Ok.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: All right, lemme ask you something. Let’s say
I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a
lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’d tell you to bet a bundle.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Vickie?… Vickie, you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You asleep?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tell me, you think of anybody else when I’m
making love to you?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Nobody. I love you, remember?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then why’d you say that thing about Tony
Janiro?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That he’s got a pretty face.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I never noticed his face.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You sure you’re not thinking of him right
now?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re the one who said he was good looking.
You think he’s good looking ’cause I know you think he’s good-looking.
I’ll smash his face inside out. I’ll make him into dog meat. Nobody’s
gonna think he’s good-looking when I get through with him. So you just
go ahead and think about who you want.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: Tony Janiro, 151 lbs. and one half.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: Jake LaMotta, 155 lbs. and one fourth.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: Ok. This is official.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: LaMotta, 155 lbs. on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: LaMotta.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The winner, by unanimous decision, in ten
rounds, Jake LaMotta!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This is my night! Listen to them! I’m gonna be
champ!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m making everything up to you.</p>
<p><strong>detroit promoter</strong>: When we gonna get Jake back in
Detroit? Jesus, he really did a job on Janiro. Who you after next,
Joey?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I dunno. We’re working on it. He’s training at
the camp now.</p>
<p><strong>jackie curtie</strong>: After what I seen, they gotta give
him a shot at the title.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We’re gonna get our shot.</p>
<p><strong>detroit promoter</strong>: Oh Joey, this is Jackie Curtie. He
handles a lot of business in South Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>jackie curtie</strong>: I like your brother. Made a lot of
money on him.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Betcha more than he has.</p>
<p><strong>jackie curtie</strong>: Made a little cabbage on the Tommy
Bell fight too. Whatever happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Ain’t he dead?</p>
<p><strong>detroit promoter</strong>: Nah. He’s got a job downtown. Runs
an elevator in some building.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>detroit promoter</strong>: Went down to see him the other
day. I says, “Tommy, take me up to the fifth floor.” And you know, he
took me right up there.</p>
<p><strong>jackie curtie</strong>: Yeah, Tommy always was a stand-up
guy.</p>
<p><strong>detroit promoter</strong>: Joey, let me get you another
drink.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Just a minute. Excuse me. I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: C’mere, let me talk to you for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’re you doin’ with Salvy? You shouldn’t be
here with him. Jake’s away killin’ himself. Suppose he found out.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because
Jake is training, I can’t go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: No, you’re his wife.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I’m not doing anythina wrong. I’m just
trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all
the time?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It don’t look right.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He’s gonna kill
me anyway. It’s a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m not gonna tell him nothing; but if he
finds out, he will kill you. What’s the matter with you? Aren’t you
happy? You got everything you want.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You don’t sleep with him. I do. I don’t get
to breathe without tellin’ him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I’m
lookin’ at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He
don’t trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now,
you’d be in trouble too – believe me. Look at me, Joey. I’m 19 years
old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don’t know. He gets
crazy sometimes. I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Try to understand, Vickie. Jake’s got a lotta
aggravation. He’s been a top contender too long.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: That’s right, take his part. You’re his
brother. He’s never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: And you’re drinking with them right now.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: And I’m gonna finish my drink. And, I’m
gonna have a good time, because I ain’t doing nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You’re wrong to be here. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I said, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Joey, relax. You’re taking this the wrong
way. Why don’t you sit down and have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Excuse me, I’m talking to my sister
in-law.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Excuse me for living.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What do you think, I’m blind? My brother’s
breaking his ass in a ring, and you’re here with his wife.</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Hey Joey, I’m here with Patsy and Vera and
Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We’re just trying to have
a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don’t you just take it
easy before this gets out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Get the fuck outa here. What did you do, take
your gangster pills today? I’ll tear your fuckin’ head off your
shoulders!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hey, wait –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ain’t you forgettin’ something? Ain’t there
never supposed to be no trouble in this joint?</p>
<p><strong>salvy</strong>: Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin’ to die young?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’ll suck your eyes out! I’ll fuckin’ take the
two of you.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Fuckin’ low-life, cocksucker, etc. …</p>
<p><strong>patsy</strong>: Don’t fuckin’ put your hands on me! You’re
gonna near about this, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Get the fuck outa here. Don’t come in my place
and start fuckin’ trouble – I don’t care who you are! Get outa here. Go
on.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: All rightg I don’t have to hear any more. I
think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother’s
wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I’m not sayin’ Salvy
shouldn’t have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don’t raise your
hands. You don’t do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but
no more after this. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, I understand, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: All right, you guys, shake hands.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Go ’head. Be friends. That’s it. All right,
lemme be alone with him for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Aside from everything else, your family all
right?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, they’re good. They’re good, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: What is it with you? Can’t you talk? You got
like a funny attitude. I can’t figure you out, Joey. What’s with you and
the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Aw, Tommy, c’mon, it ain’t that.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your
brother ain’t gonna get nowhere without us – nowhere. And I’m tellin’
you between the two of us, it’s gettin’ to the point where it’s gettin’
to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: How can he embarrass you?</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: He’s an embarrassment because Frankie and the
other guys are expectin’ me to do something about it, and I’m lookin’
very bad. I can’t deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why’s he make
it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Tommy, Jake respects you. He won’t even say
hello to anybody else – you know that. But you know when Jake gets set
on somethin’, Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin’ cross and
he ain’t gonna talk him out of it. I’m his kid brother. I got no say
with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his
own.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of
money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he’s gonna become champ
on his own? We’re gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold
one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don’t listen to
nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you
understand, you tell him. I don’t care how great he is or how colorful.
He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants
to. He ain’t gonna get a shot at the title without us. I’m not askin’
you to do another thing except get that message into that thick
head!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Whatcha doin’?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I remember the first time I met Vickie… I know
there’s somethin’ up. I know she’s doin’ somethin’, but I can’t catch
her…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Maybe she’s afraid you’re gonna hit her so she
can’t talk to you the way she wants to.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Try talkin’ to her. She’s your wife – ask her
what’s the matter.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: When I’m away, did you ever notice anythin’
funny with her? Tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jack, if there was anything funny, I would
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I want you to keep an eye on her when I’m not
here. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Sure, I’ll keep an eye on her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What did Tommy say?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I got good news, and I got bad news. The good
news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: Billy Fox, 173 3/4 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: Jake LaMotta, 167 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s up, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: I’d like to talk to Jake a minute.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: I suppose you heard what everybody’s been
saying, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What who’s been sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: You were a big favorite in this fight. Then
two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you’re a
12-5 underdog.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t follow no gamblin’ Commissioner. I’m
just a fighter.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: Now the fight’s off the books altogether.
Meyer Lansky couldn’t get a bet down on this fight. Some people are
saying you’re going into the tank.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Believe what you want.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: I want to believe you, LaMotta.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m gonna kill him. That fuckin’ jig’s gonna
wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?</p>
<p><strong>eacan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You got any money you want to bet on Billy
Fox, you can put it right here… ’cause Jake LaMotta don’t go down for
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>eagan</strong>: That’s all I wanted to hear.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Stand up! What the fuck are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Got your swimming trunks on, Jake? I hope
they’re paying you enough. Fake, fake.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What’s the matter with you? What’s the matter
with you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hit me! Hit me! What’s the matter with you,
you motherfucker? Hit me!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Don’t fight anymore! It’s a free country,
don’t fight anymore!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why did they have to stop it? Why did they
have to stop it?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>handler</strong>: He must’ve been really hurt in the 2nd. He
didn’t answer me when I tried to tell him something in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get everyone out of here!</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE UP of a Daily News Headline from
November 22, 1947: “Board Suspends LaMotta.”</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It woulda been so easy, Jack. So easy…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Stick out your hands, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: C’mon, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: G’wan, do it. Protect yourself, rummy.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: See? That’s all there was to it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They
want me to fall down too? I don’t fall down for nobody. I never went
down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees?
I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin’ Garden! All the newspaper
writers make fun of me. I’m the bum of the year. All I want is a shot.
Just a fuckin’ shot. What do I gotta do? I’ll do anything.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Except fall down like a normal person.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, except fall down. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: All right, you don’t wanna fall down, so now
you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. ‘Cause there’s
nothin’ you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you
around. So you wait.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do
for seven months? I’m gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that
time I’ll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it –
I’m gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain’t never gonna hold my weight
down. Seven months! I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: We did what we had to do. Tommy don’t forget.
Sooner or later you’ll get your shot – if Tommy don’t die.</p>
<p><strong>bell captain</strong>: Mr. Williams.</p>
<p><strong>detroit promoter</strong>: It’s official. The fight’s been
postponed twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: That’s right. “No comment.” You like that?
Good, ’cause I got a lot more “No comments” where that one came
from.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I’m gonna order up some stuff. Have a
steak.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I can’t eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I’m
gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: So eat just a little. You gotta eat
something.</p>
<p><strong>jars</strong>: What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can’t even
eat!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: How long did it take you?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: 45 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: No good. Try to get it down. It’s gotta be no
more than 30 seconds to be on the safe side if we gotta stitch him
up.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jake, somebody wants to say hello to you.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Hey champ!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tommy, thanks for coming over.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: You just take it easy, now. You’ll do all
right. Feelin’ Ok?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m Ok.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Just come by to wish you luck. Need
anything?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, we’re all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Ok, champ.</p>
<p><strong>como</strong>: Look at her. As beautiful as always. Take care
of that guy, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I’ll take care of him. Thanks, Tommy.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: C’mere.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, you don’t say goodbye to him like
that.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You don’t kiss like that. Hello and goodbye,
that’s all you do.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: All I did…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know what I’m talking about. Don’t ever
make me look bad on the night of my big fight.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You’re hurting my arm.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Shut up. You just say hello and goodbye to
him. You don’t kiss him the way you did. That’s out of line.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: But Jake… I didn’t say anything…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t ever do that again. You don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You hear what I said? You don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jake, Jake…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She ain’t gonna ruin this fight for me.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And here is the young man who has
inherited Marcel Cerdan’s European championship - Laurent
Dauthuille.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And our very special guest tonight needs
no introduction. The only man to defend the heavyweight crown a
remarkable twenty-five times, the king of all heavyweights, the Brown
Bomber, Joe Louis. Come into the ring, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe louis</strong>: Thank you, Johnny. Let’s bring the
middleweight crown back to the old U.S.A. where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And in this corner, the middleweight
champion of the world, from Casablanca, Morocco, the Casablanca Clouter,
Marcel Cerdan!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And in the opposite corner, from New
York, New York, the challenger, the Bronx Bull, Jake LaMotta!</p>
<p><strong>jaye</strong>: I only wish it was you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe louis</strong>: Win the belt back for us, Jake. Good
luck.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Look at him, Jackie! You got at! The fuckin’
championship! He’s yours! Finish him off.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The new middleweight champion of the
world by a knockout after nine rounds, the Bronx Bull, Jake LaMotta!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It’s a
thrill to be standin’ here talking to you wonderful people. In fact,
it’s a thrill to be standin’. I haven’t seen so many people since my
last fight at Madison Square Garden. After that fight a reporter asked
me, “Jake, where do you go from here?” I said, “To a hospital.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I fought one hundred and six professional
fights and none of them bums figured out how to fight me – they kept
hitting me in the head! Will somebody at the bar – Linda? - get me a
drink. I figure if I’m gonna work to drunks I might as well be one of
’em! I like this place. It’s a family type club… every night I see a lot
of fathers sitting out there with their young daughters! That’s
nice.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Thanks, honey. – She’s terrific. The kinda
girl you wanta take home to meet your father. Especially if your old
man’s a degenerate! – Here’s a toast! “To your health! You only live
once. But if you play it right, once is enough.” I shouldn’t be drinkin’
like this ‘cause I’m tryin’ to lose weight. I’m on this terrific diet –
I’m allowed to eat anything I want. As long as I don’t swallow it! Well,
I never had much luck with my weight. In fact, – I never had much luck
with anything – until about a few years ago, when this happened –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: … thanks, I’m glad to see you remember. For
those of you that don’t… that’s me takin’ the title from Cerdan. You
know, the tough thing about winnin’ the title… the next thing you gotta
do is have a rematch… just to show it wasn’t no fluke. So what happens?
Marcel Cerdan, a really great champ, after I beat him… he gets himself
killed in that airplane crash… a pretty rotten break for him. That’s why
I don’t like to fly. People say to me, “Look, Jake, when your time is
up, your time is up.” And I say, “Yeah, but suppose I’m on the plane and
the pilot’s time is up?” As good as Cerdan was, I could’ve taken him
again. But I never got the chance to prove it wasn’t no fluke. He got
killed but he got to be what they call a legend. I don’t know what’s
worse – bein’ a fluke or bein’ a legend. – That’s the kinda luck I got.
That’s why I quit the ring and moved down here from New York. My wife
said, “You gotta get outa this town, Jake.” Come to think of it… the
boxing commission said the same thing! But I don’t miss New York. Give
me Miami any day.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Miami’s a great place. I get along with
everybody in this town… even the police force… They got the best cops
here money can buy! – Only kiddin’. By the way… me and my wife Vickie’s
gettin’ ready to celibrate our eleventh wedding anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We get along real great. We fight a little but
I never really belted her on purpose. Once in a while I’m standin’ there
doin’ little shadow-boxin’ and she happens to walk right into the
shadow… I can’t help that. She says, “Whataya hittin’ me for?” I says,
“It’s nothin’. It’s only a love tap.” She says, “It’s a good thing
you’re not crazy about me!” – I am crazy about her. I heard her talkin’
to a friend on the phone and she was sayin’, “After eleven years, I’m
still in love with the same guy.” – If I ever find out who the bum is,
I’ll kill him! Women. You can’t live with ’em, you can’t live without
’em.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: “‘Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy. It is the
green-eyed monster, which doth mock the meat it feeds on. That cuckold
lives in bliss who, certain of his fate, loves not his woronger; But O,
what damned minutes tells he o’er who dotes, yet doubts – suspects, yet
fondly loves!” – That’s from somethin’ called”Othello” –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is whispering nothing? Is leaning cheek to
cheek? Is meeting noses? Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career of
laughter with a sign? – A note infallible of breaking honesty – horsing
foot on foot? Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift? Hours,
minutes? Noon, midnight? and all eyes blind with the pin and web but
theirs, theirs only, that would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing? Why,
then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing; The covering sky is
nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these
nothings, if this be nothing.” – That’s from something called “The
Winter’s Tale” – Shakespeare! You all remember Shakespeare. He wrote all
them famous plays one after the other, then he went into a big slump and
he ain’t done anything good in years. That speech is about jealousy –
jealousy’s a bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot of guys… take me… I
almost killed my brother… I love him… he’s my family… I mean, there’s
nothin’ he wouldn’t do for me. And that’s the way we been goin’ thru
life – doin’ nothin’ for each other! Anytime he got in trouble when we
was kids, I got him out of it. You know, he used to steal little things
when we was growin’ up. But he was particular… only stole things that
begin with an ‘a’ – a watch, a car, a suit, a ring… But I was wrong… I
shoulda never hit my brother. Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every time I
need somethin’ I gotta go shoppin’ for it! A psychiatrist once told me,
“When you hit your brother you’re really hittin’ your mother, but you
can’t admit it to yourself.” He’s really crazy. I woulda never hit my
mother. I mean, only in self-defense!</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake, you’re home.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hi, Vickie.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tryin’ to get this fuckin’ TV to work. Paid
all this money for it and still can’t get a station a mile away. And
Mr. Wizard here ain’t no help.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Screw you, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I went out.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s that kissing on the mouth shit?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What? I just said hello. Since when I can’t
kiss my sister-in-law?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ain’t a cheek ever good enough for you? I
never even kissed Mama on the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Well, you’re not supposed to kiss your mother
on the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, that’s what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I can’t tell. You’re stomach’s in the way.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Don’t give me those looks. I’m just your
manager. The minute you start to be champ, you start eating like there’s
no tomorrow. And you giving me looks. All I know is that I don’t have to
defend my title next month.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Answer me somethin’. What happened at the Copa
with Salvy when I was out of town?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know, when you gave him a beatin’.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Nothin’. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk
or somethin’, I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin’.
Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It’s all forgotten
about.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me about it?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: It didn’t have nothin’ to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Didn’t it have nothin’ to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: No, I just told you what happened.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who did it have anything to do with…
Vickie?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to
you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, I heard some things.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: “You heard some things.” Will you stop
worryin’ about that shit? Forget about it. You know you got a title
fight comin’ up.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Whatever you touched, that’s good now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Did Salvy fuck Vickie?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re supposed to keep an eye on her for me.
I’m askin’…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I did keep an eye…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then why did you give him a beatin’ if he
didn’t do anything? You and him been friends a long time.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks
who the fuck he is. He’s been passing certain remarks that I don’t
like.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t bullshit me, Joey. You ain’t tellin’ me
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What bullshit? Hey, I’m your brother. You
wanna believe me - you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: When it comes to her, I don’t trust nobody.
I’m askin’ you somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Well, you’re wrong Jack. I’m tellin” you what
happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it’s staightened out
now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You givin’ me that look. I gotta accept your
word, but if I find out anythin’, I’m gonna kill somebody…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill
Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you’re at it. What do I care?
You’re killing yourself the way you’re eating, the way you worry about
things you don’t have to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean, “you”?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean, “you”?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody.
You’re a big shot. Kill, kill… g’head.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But you said “you.”</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Eh, Joey, even you don’t know what you meant.
You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you – that means somethin’. Why’d you
say them? You coulda said anybody.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: You’re worried about this girl, you’re gonna
let this girl ruin you’re life for you… You wanna worry, worry about
your fuckin’ stomach that you can’t bend over – that you gotta step in
the ring in a month.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Did you ever fuck my wife?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t mean now. I mean before – before we
met.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Whadda ya mean?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Did you ever fuck my wife?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Whatsa matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody
gives me a straight answer around here. You’re givin’ me these answers,
but you still didn’t answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can’t
take this shit. Lenore is waitin’ for me. I gotta go. You’re a definite
wacko. You’re fuckin’ crazy, you know that, crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where you been all day?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I took the kids to my sister’s.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I called. You weren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I got bored so I went to the movies.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’d you see?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I went to the movies.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’d you see?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: “Father of the Bride.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What was it about?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Oh, c’mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell
you everything?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Did you ever go to the Copa when I was
away?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Answer me when I talk to you. What happened
that night?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I am answering…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do I have to do to get a straight answer
around here.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake, no –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do I have to kill you, eh? Do I have to kill
somebody to get an answer? I know about you at the Copa. I know all
about it.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I didn’t do anything wrong. I swear. I just
had a few drinks.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: With Salvy, eh?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.
Stop it. I just had a drink, that’s all. I didn’t do anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy? Answer
me. Open this fuckin’ door, you fuckin’ cunt! Who’ve you been
fuckin’?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re a fuckin’ liar.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who’ve you been fuckin’? Salvy? Tommy Como? I
can’t trust nobody. Did you fuck Joey? Who you been fuckin’?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: All right, I fucked everybody! Go ahead,
kill me, kill me.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I’ll say anything you want me to say. I
fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked
everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother’s fuckin’
cock!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Yeah, I sucked his cock.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Don’t hit your brother! Be nice.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Jake, stop it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my
wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Stop it. What’re you, crazy?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You didn’t tell me. You didn’t tell me. You
let me marry her. You let me marry her.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You’re killing him. You’re killing him for
nothing. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean
nothing’? You stupid bitch!</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Nothing is what I said! Go on, kull me. Kill
me. I’m not afraid of you anymore. I don’t care if you kill me like
you’re killing him. You’re a sick animal.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re the fuckin’ animal! You ran around with
every guy I knew while I was breakin’ my ass for you.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You’re not only an animal, you’re a stupid
animal. You’re rotten. Rotten. Rotten. You’re a sick maniac. A maniac!
You belong in a mental hospital.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Well, he ain’t dead in case you’re
interested. I’m leaving you. And I don’t care if you do try to kill me.
Go ahead. I’m not afraid of you anymore. There’s worse things than being
dead and one of them’s living with you – I’m leaving tonight. I must
have been crazier than you are for stayin’ with you this long. You’re
hopeless. You’re not gonna let anybody love you. I kept thinking that
you’d change when you got to be the champ… But I just can’t take it
anymore. I’m taking the kids and I’m leavin’.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aw, Vickie, aw Vickie, please no. Vickie, no…
don’t leave me. Christ, I’m pleading… I know, I know all the bad things,
but I need you. I’m a bum without you and the kids. I’ll change. Aw,
Vickie, maybe I don’t do it the right way, but I love you. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You know, if there’s one thing – I just
don’t understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It ain’t worth it, Jake. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: At night?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Yeah. At night.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How many pounds I gotta lose?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Three more, I figure.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth.
Just a chip of ice.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’ll give you anything you want, Jake. I think
you should come out for a few minutes – give yourself a break.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I’ll
lose the title.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake, why don’t you just try lying down and
get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t know what it is. I dunno, it’s the
kind of thing that – the words won’t come out.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I want to say something to you without you
blowing your stack.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: OK. Talk.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Why don’t you just call him up?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone
and say, “Joey, I’m sorry about that little trouble we had. How about
havin’ dinner?” Is that what I say?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: No, not that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ringside announcer</strong>: … Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve sat
in front of these microphones for over twenty years but this is the
strangest championship bout I’ve ever seen. With two minutes to go in
the final round, the champion, the mighty Bull from the Bronx, is just
simply taking punch after punch from the challenger. Dauthuille scores a
combination, then backpedals. LaMotta pursues him. One minute to go.
Laurent DauthuiLlle, who has already beat Lamotta in a non-title bout,
is about to fulfill a dream – to bring the middleweight crown back to
France.</p>
<p><strong>ringside’announcer</strong>: Thirty seconds to go. The Bull
starts to swing. LaMotta comes in for a brutal body combinaticn: one,
two, three, four punches. LaMotta has landed a solid left hook to the
Frenchman’s jaw! Dauthuille seems confused. LaMotta is swinging wildly
now: right, left, right, left! Dauthuille is backing off! Everyone is on
their feet! I can hardly see, ladies and gentlemen. Dauthuille is on the
ropes. LaMotta hits a right – Dauthuille is down! Dauthuille is down!
Referee Lou Handler is counting him out – three, four, five – if
Dauthuille can stand, he’ll win the decision – eight, nine – Dauthuille
is on one knee – ten! It’s all over! With thirteen seconds left on the
clock, Jake LaMotta has retained his middleweight championship in one of
the most remarkable combacks in boxing! Dauthuille is standing now,
confused. But the fight is over.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The middleweight champion, and still
champion by a knockout in fifteen rounds, the Bronx Bull, the Raging
Bull, Jake LaMotta!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Why don’t you just call him?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Tell him how you feel – you miss him. Tell
him you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ok, all right. Telephone’s in the hall. Dial
his number.</p>
<p><strong>the hallway</strong>: As the number starts to ring, VICKIE
hands the phone to JAKE.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Hello… hello…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’s this, a joke? Hello… Hey!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Well, if there’s somebody listenin’, their
mother’s a fuckin’ whore who takes it in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I shoulda never hit my brother. Afterwards I
was sorry. Now every time I need somethin’ I gotta go shoppin’ for it! A
psychiatrist once told me, “When you hit your brother you’re really
hittin’ your mother but you can’t admit it to yourself.” He’s really
crazy. I woulda never hit my mother. I mean, only in self-defense! A lot
of people wanta know who was the best guy I ever fought. Let’s see…
there was that one I fought twice… the other Frenchman… you know who I
mean… … Dauthuille! He was tough, but I beat him… I had to! I mean, how
would it sound losin’ to a guy whose name you can’t even pronounce? But…
Robinson. I can say that alright. I fought Sugar Ray so many times it’s
a wonder I don’t have diabetes! Linda… get me another drink! Linda’s the
most popular waitress here… you can tell by her tips! She’s the kinda
girl I go for. You oughta see the ones I get.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: … Thanks, babe. She’s a nice kid. She’ll only
do it with a guy if she really likes him. She’s got a lot in common with
Will Rogers – never met a man she didn’t like! … I was talkin’ about
Sugar Ray. Some of you think I was better than him… but you know, it’s a
toss up. Except the last fight… February 14, 1951.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Valentine’s Day. The anniversary of the
St. Valentine’s Massacre. Robinson didn’t use a machine gun but it was
still a massacre…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Actually, I was doin’ okay at first. In fact,
by the end of the fifth round I really had him worried – he thought he
killed me.</p>
<p><strong>lenore</strong>: Look at that. The sonofabitch is outboxing
Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I can’t believe he’s getting that jab in.</p>
<p><strong>pabst commercial</strong>: “Friend, the quality that has
carried Pabst Blue Ribbon around the world is yours for the asking. Next
time that friendly bartender says, ‘What’ll you have?’ give him the
answer the whole world gives, Pabst Blue Ribbon!”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He ain’t hurting me, but I can’t get him
down.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Don’t talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You’re
ahead on points.</p>
<p><strong>s.r.’s trainer</strong>: He’s going, Sugar. He’s old. He
ain’t Jake LaMotta no more. Make your move, Sugar. Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: LaMotta’s on queer street, but he’s
still standing. Robinson throws a right, a left, a right, a right and a
right again! How can LaMotta stay on his feet?</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: No man can take this kind of
punishment. LaMotta is just a rag doll now. God knows what’s holding him
up. This is an historic beating. Sugar Rav staggers LaMotta with a left
and comes across with a blackjack punch to the champion’s head. The
referee is stepping in, Robinson has LaMotta on the ropes. That’s it!
Sugar Ray Robinson, former welterweight champion, has taken the
middleweight crown from Jake LaMota.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You never knocked me down. You could never
knock me down.</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m pulling out of next Wednesday’s TV bout
’cause I can’t make the weight. I’m fighting at light heavyweight, and I
still can’t make the weight.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Does that mean…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It means I’m through with boxing. I’m tired
with tryin’ to make the weight anymore. I’m sick of thinkin’ about
weight, weight, weight.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You sound bitter.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why should I be bitter? Boxing’s been good to
me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife – take a picture of
her. Vickie.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ain’t she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America
if I didn’t pull her outa the contest. Didn’t want her wearing a
swimsuit for nobody but me.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What do you think of Jake’s retirement,
Mrs. LaMotta?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I also bought a club on Collins Avenue, and
I’m gonna open it real soon. Know what I’m gonna call it? “Jake
LaMotta’s.”</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Valentine’s Day. The anniversary of the
St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Robinsin didn’t use a machine gun but it
was still a massacre… Actually, I was doin’ okay at first. In fact, by
the end of the fifth round I really had him worried — he thought he
killed me. You know, I could keep tellin’ you this brilliant material
all night – but you’d only laugh. Now I’m gonna sing. – Any requests? I
mean, besides “don’t”! – In the key of H. You’re laughin’. Give me the
right key and I’ll play in anybody’s flat! I sing for a reason. When I
finish, you’ll be so sobered up, we’ll sell a lot of booze.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: “When the fighter’s not engaged in his
employment, his employment, although he was Champ and quite the rage, he
must go somewhere else to seek employment, seek employment. So what does
he do? He goes upon the stage and meets his true adversaries, all you
members of the human race. But a fighter’s life is not a bowl of
cherries, still I’d rather have an egg than a fist upon my face… That’s
Entertainment!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: J.R., glad you could make it.</p>
<p><strong>j.r.</strong>: You were great, Jake. Just like old times.
Good thing Sugar Ray wasn’t here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State’s
Attorney Bronson and his wife.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sorry, empty! Heh, heh! Oh, I didn’t mean
that. If I don’t give your husband no money, he won’t have enough to buy
you a drink. To show you I’m a nice guy, this one’s on me. The last one
was your payment for this month.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re a good sport, lady.</p>
<p><strong>j.r.</strong>: I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in ’46, Jake.
In Chicago. You were great.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.</p>
<p><strong>j.r.</strong>: Where’s your wife, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do you think I’d let her in a place like this
with guys like you hangin’ around?</p>
<p><strong>j. r.</strong>: You ought to see his wife.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, Ricky, glad you came.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Wouldn’t miss it, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, honey, give these fellas a round on me. I
can tell they’re gonna be regular customers.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’ll have to ask for your I.D.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Whew! Any girl that can kiss like that can
drink in my club any time!</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry. I had to work late last night.
Slept at the club.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I’m leaving your Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sure, what else is new?</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: No. This time it’s true. I didn’t bother to
tell you until I had everything worked out.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Open the door, Vickie.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: No. I won’t talk to you where you can use
your hands on me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aw, c’mon. Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I got a lawyer, Jake. We’re getting a
divorce. I’m getting custody of the kids.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aw, c’mon, Vick –</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: I’m sick of it. I can’t watch you this way.
You’re too drunk all the time. There’s too many girls. I can’t… I don’t
wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: You got three days to get your stuff out of
the house. After that, the cops will be there. I have the kids with me.
I never want to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>1st deputy</strong>: Let’s go, Jake, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?</p>
<p><strong>1st deputy</strong>: We’re from…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know where you’re from. You guys look the
same every place.</p>
<p><strong>1st deputy</strong>: They wanna talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>1st deputy</strong>: I don’t run the joint. They just told me
to bring you in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>2nd deputy</strong>: C’mon, get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, I’m a big tax payer down here. Don’t that
entitle me to some information what this is all about?</p>
<p><strong>2nd deputy</strong>: You recognize this girl? She been in the
club?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>2nd deputy</strong>: She says you introduced her to men.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I introduced a lot of people to men. So what?
What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>2nd deputy</strong>: She’s fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Vickie, open up. I need to come in.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Please, Vick. I won’t bother you. I’m out on
bail. You can send the kids next door. I just gotta pick one thing up,
then I’ll get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: The kids are sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: All right, just don’t make any noise.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if
we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case
dropped.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: But they don’t have a case against you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are you kiddin’? Did you ever see a
14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? “LaMotta on Vice
Rap.” Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Jake, be careful! What’re you doing to the
belt?!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t make no difference no more.</p>
<p><strong>vickie</strong>: Can’t you get the money from your
friends?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What friends?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Didn’t you also wish to sell the
Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s it. Those are the jewels that were in
the belt.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: But where’s the belt?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You want the jewels or the belt?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Both. These stones are worth about fifteen
hudred dollars, but the belt of a champion is a very rare item. The belt
with the stones untouched would have been worth near five thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I can’t raise the ten thousand. Fuck ’em. Let
’em put me on trial.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So there I am in the can… and not the one that
says “gentlemen” on the door. I’m talkin’ about jail! Down south! I
mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down
in cracker country. And if you’re a guy like me, you ain’t got a chance
in a place like that. Especially if you’re Italian… you come from the
Bronx… and you’re an ex-champ. As soon as they saw me… soon as they
heard me… I know I’m in trouble. To me, they got an accent, and to them,
I got an accent! You gotta get the picture – I’m big, I got small hands,
I walk like I’m still in the ring… the balls of my feet pop up and down,
you know… and whenever I get the chance, I read a lot. So naturally,
takin’ all this into co sideration, they figure it adds up to one thing
– I’m queer! Now I didn’t mind too much when they called me “Queer” or
“Mr. Tough Guy” or “Yankee Punk”… But one day these screws got to me… I
was workin’ on the work gang, pickin’ up some trees that were knocked
down by a storm or somethin’ and puttin’ ‘em on this truck. All of a
sudden… one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the
ground. I’m lyin’ there with a tree across my chest! This screw walks
over, takin’ his time, he looks down at me and says, “Well, Champ Pimp…
you lyin’ down on the job again?”! They got a great sense of humor when
they’re standin’ there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on
your chest! So I look up at him and say, “Oh, this tree… it fell on me.”
And he says, “Oh, I’m sorry… If I’d have known, I would’ve yelled
‘timber’” I said, “Hey, look… it hurts. I think maybe I broke
somethin’!” He says, “Well, whaddaya know… Champ PImp’s got himself a
boo-boo.” Then I got as stupid as him. I said, “If I’m Champ Pimp… how
‘bout givin’ me the money you made last night?”! Then another screw
comes over and says, “This Yankee creep givin’ you trouble?” – What kind
of trouble? What am I gonna do – hit ‘em with the tree? Now anybody else
in their right mind would’ve said, “No sir, I wouldn’t think of giving
any of you gentlemen trouble… I just want to serve my time and get the
hell out of here as soon as I can.” That’s anybody else. When I said it…
it was a little different. “You stupid cracker… take your hands off me
or I’ll get up and kick your brains out – but first you gotta bend over
so I can find ‘em!” Next thing I know I’m in the hole. Solitary
confinement. All my life I had guys in my corner yellin’”Go get ’em,
jake… kill ’em! You’re the greatest.” Now there’s nobody rootin’ for me.
But it wasn’t so bad. I learned things there. I learned how to scratch a
calendar on the wall. I never knew how to do that before. Now I know.
Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is two scratches. Wednesday is three
scratches. And so on. Except for Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.
Sundays rested.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why, why, why? I’m a man, I’m a man. I’m no
faggot. I’m not a faggot. Ma, why? What do they want? My cock’s not
enough. What do they want from me? Why? Ma? Why?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why, why, why me? You took it away from me.
They took everything away. What do they want from me? What the fuck do
they want from me? I ain’t bad. I ain’t bad. I’m not that guy. I’m not
that guy. I’m not a monster. I’m not an animal.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m not like that. Please. I’m not like that.
Please. Please. Please.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And so, as Shakespeare said, I’ve been down so
low there’s nowhere else to go.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Except here, gentlemen, with you bums. I call
you “gentlemen”… but you know what you really are! You know, this place
used to be pretty exclusive… now they got bouncers outside to throw the
drunks in! My first night here I said to the boss, “Where’s the toilet?”
– He said, “You’re in it!” By the way, this engagement is just a
stepping stone for me. If I do good here, I’m ready to get out of the
business!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: OK, OK, I know what you’re waitin’ for – and
from the looks of you, you been waitin’ for it for a long time. I had my
own joint in Miami Beach once… it was too high-class for you guys… we
had a 50-cent minimum charge just to keep out the riff-raff!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, sorry. Here’s your girls. Yeah, she’s
here… just like it’s advertised out front. She’s come back. A girl who’s
seen the Lower Depths… who’s been as far as I have in that direction.
She’s on her way back up now… give you an idea how low she was! Let’s
give her a warm welcome… make her glad she’s back, boys. – Miss Emma
48’s!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look, sweetie, be a good girl. Here’s some
money. Take a cab. Go home by yourself. Just wanna walk around a little,
sort of unwind.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Will I see you later?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. I dunno… I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey, Joey –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute, please
–</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Aw, Joey –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re right. You’re perfectly right. You got
every right in the world to hate my guts.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, please. I know I was a cocksucker. You’re
right. I shoulda never raised my hands to you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, Joey, listen to me –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Go ahead. Hit me again. I deserve it… Pay me
back… More…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know, I’m not a philosopher or anything
like that but I been around a little and the way I look at it is –
We’re, all of us, lookin’ for the same thing: a shot at the title. No
matter what you wanta be… you wanta shot at bein’ the best. Well, I had
mine and it’ll always be in the record books… it don’t make no
difference what happens to me from here on in – I got my shot and that’s
a fact. Some guys weren’t that lucky… like the one Marlon Brando played
in “On the Waterfront” – an up and comer who’s now a down and outer. You
remember… there was this scene in the back of the car with his brother
Charlie, a small-time racket guy, and it went somethin’ like this – “It
wasn’t him, Charlie. It was you. You ‘member that night in the Garden
you came down my dressing room and said. ’Kid, this ain’t your night.
We’re going for the price on Wilson.’ You ‘member that? ’This ain’t your
night!’ My night – I coulda taken Wilson apart! So what happens? He gets
the title shot outdoors on the ballpark, and what do I get? A one-way
ticket to Palookaville. I never was no good after that night. It was
like a peak you reach. Then it went downhill. It was you, Charlie. You
was my brother, Charlie. You shoulda looked out for me a little bit. You
shoulda taken care of me just a little bit so I wouldn’t have to take
them dives for the short end money… You don’t understand! I coulda had
class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody – instead of a
bum, which is what I am. Let’s face it. It was you, Charlie.”</p>
<p><strong>stagehand</strong>: Hey Jake, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How long do I have?</p>
<p><strong>stagehand</strong>: About five minutes</p>
