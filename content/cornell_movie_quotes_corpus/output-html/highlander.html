<p><strong>first man</strong>: MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: My, but are you the picture.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: It’s a bit tight.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Ah, Conor, how you look a man.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Have you time for some- thing to eat?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: No, Mother. They’ll be here shortly.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Your grandfather wore that in his service to
the King, and I to fight for the Duke.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Must he go?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Aye. It is his duty. All of ours.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: But Ian, he’s still but a boy.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He’s a MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’ll be fine Mother.</p>
<p><strong>clansman</strong>: They march.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Is the boy among them?</p>
<p><strong>clansman</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>vassal #1</strong>: Is a bad day for this.</p>
<p><strong>vassal #2</strong>: The Duke has been compro- mised. He will
have his due.</p>
<p><strong>vassal #1</strong>: By day’s end he will have our heads.</p>
<p><strong>vassal #2</strong>: We ride against the Suther- lands. That
is all that matters.</p>
<p><strong>vassal #1</strong>: This makes no sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: The fog is bad. We cannot even see the sides
of our own ranks.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: Is this your first?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: It’s begun.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: There can be but one.</p>
<p><strong>vassal #1</strong>: Leave him!</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Kevin! Get is a backup.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I was merely walking by when-</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: They’re on their way.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut
libertasi David de manu regis Saul…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …In mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum
meum…</p>
<p><strong>vassal #1</strong>: Has the boy died?</p>
<p><strong>clansman</strong>: He is having the last rites now. It should
be over by morning.</p>
<p><strong>vassal #1</strong>: Never seen anybody cut as bad live so
long. He should have died on the field.</p>
<p><strong>clansman</strong>: Tonight or tomorrow, it’s all the
same.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …Auditorium nostrum in nomine domini…</p>
<p><strong>vassal #1</strong>: This has been a dark day.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: …Requiescant in pace…</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: Real clean. No sawing action at all.
Whatever it was did it in one swipe. Like the other one.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: What about that?</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: Hasn’t any blood on it.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: About the only thing that doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: I’ll give it a closer look when I get
back.</p>
<p><strong>officer #3</strong>: Come on Brenna, you know better than
that.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’m invited.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Mr. Levine…</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: Hope this isn’t past your bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Doesn’t have a head, does he?</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: This one came unassembled.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Just show her what she came for, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: Come on, this is more your line of
work.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: How’s your uncle? I hardly ever see him
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: Didn’t look like it came from
“Toys-Are-Us”, that’s why I called you.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Didn’t think it was my buddy over there.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: Figured you knew more about swords than I
did.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Claymore.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Scottish claymore. Take a French epee, add
twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you’ve got a
claymore.</p>
<p><strong>examiner</strong>: You’re the expert.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’s in good condition.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: This your present address?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Mr.- Taupin, what were you doing in that
alley?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I was walking by when I heard a shout. Your
men came right after.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Did you know the victim?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your
memory.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: It doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: He was carrying a Syrian passport and had
been in the country less than a week.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Two days ago a Bulgarian national was
murdered the same way. He’d also been in the country less than a week.
What is your citizenship?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: American.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Do you make a habit of hanging out in that
neigh- borhood at night?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: What are you getting at?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Let’s just say that in my years with this
department I’ve seen more than one well dressed business man look for a
hand job on 14th Street.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: What were <em>you</em> looking for?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Do you know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I presume it’s a sword.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: A claymore to be exact. You wouldn’t know
anything about it would you?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Your murder weapon?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: It was covered with Mr. Fasil’s fingerprints,
but none of his blood.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: A mystery.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: For the moment.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: All right Mr. Taupin, we’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Ah Steven, it is good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>traveller</strong>: I only just heard of Conor. I came up
from Catroch as soon as I could.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re a kind man to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>traveller</strong>: I thought it only proper to pay me last
respects to the family.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Steven, Conor didn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>traveller</strong>: But I had heard his wounds were
mortal.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: They were Steven, they were. It’s been a
miracle it has. He lasted right through and healed. No one in the
village has ever seen anything like it. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’re pretty today.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’m your future husband, remember?</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: I have no future husband.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I don’t understand. Not a week ago your
father gave us his blessing.</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: My future husband died in battle against the
Sutherlands.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What are you saying? I’m standing here as
real as you.</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: You cannot be real, Conor. You had the last
rites. No man has been cut half as bad and lived.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: But I did live.</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: Live? In less than a week you’re prancing
about the country like a squirrel.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: So why the crazy talk? It’s a miracle it is.
Saint Andrew has smiled on me. On us.</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: Some think not.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: There’s rumor in the village. Some call it
magic.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: That’s mad. Surely you don’t take their
word?</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: I don’t know, Conor. It’s not natural. Maybe
something has touched you.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’re sounding like that mad woman, Widow
Baggins.</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: Me father has taken back my hand.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Ah, Lassie…</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: Please not be touching me, Conor.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’ll not take that kind of talk from you.
From those others below, maybe. But not from you.</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: Leave me alone, Conor. Please.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’re not talking sense, Mara!</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: If you send me away now, Mara, I’ll not come
looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>mara</strong>: Do what you must.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mrs. Thompson agreed to settle for
fifteen, Melvin’s wants to make a pick-up at three o’clock, the coffee
machine’s broken, and there’s a Miss Cartwright from the Smithsonian in
your office.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Do you play?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Very traditional.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’d like to ask you about the claymore.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: It’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’s quite rare you know, some- thing so
common in its time so well looked after all these years.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here
to sell the sword, there’s very little I can help you with. Now if you
will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Byzantine?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Basil the II.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Charming guy, Basil. Once after beating an
army of Serbians he blinded all but-</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: -All but one out of a hundred, I know. All
left to be led like donkeys back home. Now if you will please-</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Good reflexes.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Good day, Miss Cartwright.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I don’t believe him.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: He’s too cool. Too sharp. I think he’s got
something to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>researcher #1</strong>: Oh, has your penetrating research on
9th Century Lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the
criminal mentality?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Screw off, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>researcher #2</strong>: The cops bought it. They let him
go.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What could they hold him for? I think
they’re just waiting for something concrete before they haul him in for
real. We should look into it. He had to have gotten that sword from
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Hang on a sec, you did your little favor
for the boys downtown, I’m sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly
capable of taking it from here.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’ve seen nobleman swords that weren’t as
well preserved. It’s just a hunk of peasant iron. Why would he be
carrying it around in an alley?</p>
<p><strong>researcher #1</strong>: Here we go. Everytime there’s a
murder in town we have to put up with junior D.A.</p>
<p><strong>researcher #2</strong>: Must be genetic.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Someone should check him out. Maybe a
collection somewhere got knocked over. He has one, he might have
two.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: You see that desk? <em>Your</em> desk?
You see the crap piled up on it?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Give it a rest Ned, huh?</p>
<p><strong>researcher #2</strong>: Might be interesting to see what his
family connections are. That’s a hell of a piece to be just chuck- ing
around in an alley.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: I swear to God Brenna, between you and
Thompson’s novels I’m going to get a bloody ulcer.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Evening, Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Conor.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Ale suits me.</p>
<p><strong>tavern man #1</strong>: We rather you not be sitting with us,
Conor.</p>
<p><strong>tavern man #2</strong>: We be drinking alone as well.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What’s wrong with you all?</p>
<p><strong>tavern man #2</strong>: Requiem acer’nam donaei-</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What are you doing man?</p>
<p><strong>tavern man #2</strong>: -Et lux perpetua-</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’ll not be bringing the church into
this.</p>
<p><strong>tavern man #2</strong>: -Luceat ei-</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>tavern man #2</strong>: -Auditorium nostrum-</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>tavern man #2</strong>: -In nomine sanctus esperitu-</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Please take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I wish there was some other way.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Goodbye, Conor.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: This is against the rules.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: So’s playing choo-choo with two high school
cheerleaders in the middle of-</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: -Okay okay.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You owe me. Besides, I’m cute.</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: Taupin, Richard Marshall. Born March
16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland. Received first driver permit 1967 in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Church Hill, that’s pretty close, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>desk officer</strong>: Anything in Maryland is close.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Where!</p>
<p><strong>intruder</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: What name is he using?</p>
<p><strong>intruder</strong>: Smith. Carl Smith.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: How many came?</p>
<p><strong>intruder</strong>: The last four.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: And the Bulgarian?</p>
<p><strong>intruder</strong>: He got him. He always does.
Eventually.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: He knows I’m here. How?</p>
<p><strong>intruder</strong>: None of this would be happening if you
hadn’t run…</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: <em>Answer</em> me.</p>
<p><strong>intruder</strong>: We learned he’d found the immigration
notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York. Then he figured out
the birth records in Church Hill…</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Taupin…Taupin…</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Tarmin…Tatum…Taupin, Richard Marshall. Born
to William and Karen Taupin, no address. Attend- ing physician,
Dr. Willis Kidell.</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: 1945, that strains the memory. Here we are,
Richard Taupin.</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: Would you like more tea?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: No thank you, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: He was unsual.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: Well, this is a small town, and it was even
smaller then. Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.
Richard’s parents were just passing through when his mother’s time came.
I did it right here at the house.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Then you didn’t know Richard later on.</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’ve been trying to find somebody who knew
him and any connections his family might have had with museums or
historical societies.</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: Don’t know about any of that. Suppose nobody
does.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I don’t follow you.</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: Poor little tyke didn’t have a chance.
Hopelessly premature. He died a few days after he was born.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: The boy <em>died</em>?</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: Mother too. Sad case it was. The young lady
just couldn’t make it through labor. Never even saw her son.</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: My brother worked for the town paper at the
time. He took this picture of the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Have you spoken to anyone else about
this?</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: There was this one fella. Asked a lot of
questions. I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the
records office.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Would you remember his name?</p>
<p><strong>kidell</strong>: Carl Smith.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Just tell us when you see the one.</p>
<p><strong>uncle joe</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’m just curious.</p>
<p><strong>uncle joe</strong>: You’re never “just curious”. You’ve met
my neice, Brenna.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Hi Brenna.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Number 5, lift your coat up more.</p>
<p><strong>uncle joe</strong>: Aren’t you getting a little old for this?
You flunked out of law school.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Now there’s a new topic.</p>
<p><strong>uncle joe</strong>: Don’t they have enough for you to do at
the castle?</p>
<p><strong>uncle joe</strong>: Forgers do it all the time. They take the
birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit
I.D. Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump
it.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>uncle joe</strong>: Call your mother. You never call her.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: I don’t know. I’d have to see his
thing.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I can’t figure out why he’s doing it. He’s
been Richard Taupin at least since 1967. And the guys rich. You should
see the stuff he has in that shop.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Maybe he’s hiding from something.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Some guy named Smith was asking about him in
Church Hill. I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but
they drew a blank. So he isn’t a cop. District anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Probably just some exec ducking an
ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the
funeral. The father looked just like Richard. Even had a mark on his
cheek.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: How old is Richard?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Find the father. That should clear things
up.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Taupin, isn’t that the guy Moran picked up
the other night?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: He’d want to know about all this.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Mr. Congeniality? Let him find his own
clues. There’s a journal article in this somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Uncle Joey’s little girl. Can’t get the
taste out of her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well, the cream of society awaits. If you’re
ever in the neighborhood…</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: They found it.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: It was about fifty yards down- stream from
the head.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Both were cut real clean. Like the other
ones…</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: There’s been another murder.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Where were you Tuesday night?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: A neighbor saw your car leave.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: He’s mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Look, I don’t know what the hell you’re up
to, but I think I’ve got a pretty good idea.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: All I need is time.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I’ve got all the time in the world. Except
right now. If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Someone beat you.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Have you taken to touring small town
cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Grave robbers?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: People like that rarely leave business
cards.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Does Carl Smith?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I think you do. Better yet, I don’t think
anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I
think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You have an active imagination.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’ve been to Church Hill.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself
in matters that do not concern you. I strongly suggest you return to
Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I could find him.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I have friends.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I doubt that. Good day, Miss Cartwright.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Your help may be unneccessary.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Good afternoon, “Mr. Taupin”.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Long time.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Not so long.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You’ve been here from the start.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: My quarry grows clever with age. And the
others, incompetent.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I do hope she enjoys a good show.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: So now it ends.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Generation upon generation. Tens of
thousands of miles.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You’re the last, MacLeod. Romirez, Lacroux,
Neuvich, those fools that followed me, their heads all line my shelf.
All but yours.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Can you feel it, MacLeod? Can you
<em>feel</em> it!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: There can be but one.</p>
<p><strong>watchman</strong>: Hey! What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You’ll be safe here. He won’t kill in a
church.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Tradition.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Your name is Conor?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Juan Cid Romirez. Chief surveyor and
alchemist.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’re not from these parts.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: I am from Spain. And I would like a moment
of your time.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I haven’t much to offer, Mr. Romirez from
Spain, but you’re welcome to what’s here.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Please go to no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Your back, it would seem perhaps you were
injured in battle?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Five years past me clan fought another over
some- thing I cannot even re- member.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Your marks would suggest great injury.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I was nearly killed.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: But you lived.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I did at that.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: And but for a mark you are well as any man,
no?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: I should imagine that your recovery must
have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent
an explanation. And a solution.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I was driven out.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: And now you live in a small village miles
away from all you knew.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: How can you know this?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: First food, no? A good meal makes
conversation so much easier.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Hmm, que rico. What is it you call
this?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Pheasant.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You Scots have a way with game. It still
has life in it. Spirit. Back home the food is so…domestic.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: I was sent by his majesty of Spain to
Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’re a long way from Inverness.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: In my travels I heard the story of the
MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not
of this Earth.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You know me home. Me name.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: It was time for our paths to cross.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You see this?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken
fool crushed me. All thought I would die or be maimed for life. But I
healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You are the same?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing
were pushing against you?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yes. Always.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Does it change with me in the room?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: It is less.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You feel you know me.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: We are brothers.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: He told me there could be only one.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Some cling to sanity through time with the
one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game. You and
I Conor, we are different from all others around us. You know this, you
can feel it. We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our
neighbors we are rather difficult to injure, permanently.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You are still so very young.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’m twenty-two.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Not even a single lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: We are immortal.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: No, that can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: It is as you are.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Listen to me. Hear the words.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: This is madness!</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: It is the truth.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: This is Dr. Wickland at GWU. Your test
came back today. You can call me here at the med center if you have any
questions.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor’s voice</strong>: Brenna, where the hell are you?
The place is full of cops asking weird questions. What’s going on? I’ve
got work stacking up. Get in here right away.</p>
<p><strong>knight’s voice</strong>: Brenna.</p>
<p><strong>knight’s voice</strong>: My quarrel is not with you. Meet
me.</p>
<p><strong>knight’s voice</strong>: We have much to talk of, you and I.
Answers for the young historian. O’Reily’s. Tonight. I’ve grown to like
taverns.</p>
<p><strong>several little girls</strong>: Happy birthday to you, happy
birth- day to you, happy birthday dear Brenna, happy birthday to
you.</p>
<p><strong>mother’s voice</strong>: Hi Brenna, it’s mom. Me and your
neices just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday. Crissy made a
real cute card for you, be sure to call her. Will you be home for
Easter? Call when you can. Love you.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Three days you’ve laid there. It’s time you
ate.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: This can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You are not dead, boy. Accept it.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: This is monstrous. I’ll burn in hell for all
eternity.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You’d have to die first. Aqui.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What is to become of me? Am I to wander the
Earth forever like a ghost?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You will live. Survive.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Then they were right. I am evil. This is
God’s punishment.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You have done nothing wrong Conor
MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Oh my God. Oh my God I’m lost.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Why does he want to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You recall how I spoke of the push you feel
and how I make it less?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: It is always less with my living. Far or
near. But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever
before. There is power in this. And as long as you and I live, The
Knight can never have it all.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: But we cannot be killed.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: There is an imperfection. For all your
healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can
survive anything but steel against your threat. Then it is over. The
end.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: How can I stop such a man?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth till you
learn. You must learn to defend yourself. In this I can help.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: We are brothers. And you are a defense- -of
sorts.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: When your father died I saw to it that
the grounds were kept up.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: The money in the estate was enough to cover
your costs?</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Oh yes, more than enough.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Most of the furniture was put into
protective storage. I’ll have some boys come up and clean the place out
for you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: You’re one of William’s kids, huh?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: His only kid.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Sure take after him. Never seen a father
and son look more alike.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: We were very close.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: The resemblance is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: When may I expect the cleaners?</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: I’ll send them right up.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That stuff’ll put you away if you’re not
careful.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: There was a Count. Count Dusan. He would
invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then
slice their bellies so he could reuse it. The symmetry of that somehow
always appealed to me.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re very macabre.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’s my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Buy a birthday girl a drink?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Lager and lime.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Spare a chair?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Kahn?</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me
standing here all night?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Sit.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Head still secure to the neck.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: How many places this side of the Atlantic
serve lager and lime?</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Old habits die hard. Waitress! A round of
Nitzhic! Peasant drool, I know. But it’s the closest thing they stock to
my side of the fence.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: It is the gathering, my friend. The settling
of old scores.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: And have you something to settle with
me?</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink with an
old friend.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: It’s good to see you, Kahn.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Come, toast with me the past. To old
conquests, old loves, and to a time when we cared about either.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Waitress!</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: I’ll never forget the look on that Papal
commander’s face when his “heretic stronghold” turned out to be a rock
full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes
the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his
papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on. And what did
Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Offered the Pope one of his whores.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Had a great swing with his blade. For a
Pope.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Good times then. A man could stretch his legs
without bring- ing half the world down around his ears. Not like
now.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: He found us even there.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: He always did.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I haven’t drunk this much since-</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: -Since you last saw me.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: I love zoos. Ever since I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You were never a kid.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: I knew his great-grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: No, seriously. We used to shoot pool together
in Rangoon.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: How do you do it, Kahn? How do you live so
full of life for so long?</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of
value we have. All else is just marking time. You’re marking time.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I’ve had a few more concerns.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: The pressure only comes when you let the taste
slip into your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kahn</strong>: You don’t run as hard, MacLeod. You just don’t
run as hard anymore.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: I apoligize for the lateness of the
hour, but I’m sure you will all agree the quality of this year’s
collection is well worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: For this fine example of medieval
religious art, let us open the bid at 4,000 dollars.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: 10,500 once, 10,500 twice…</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: 11,000. A bid at 11,000.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: No, I-</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Mr. Taupin? I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Finished?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: He tried to kill me last night.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Dupont Circle.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: At the moment? Carl Smith.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What will you do now?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You needn’t worry Miss Cartwright. I’ve been
at this a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: He called you “MacLeod”.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Not your concern.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I left a man dead in Felton. But you don’t
really care, do you?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: That bothers you?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: He was innocent.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: He’s dead. Whatever I may or may not feel
means exceedingly little to him now.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’m a witness to a murder. That seems to put
me pretty high on your friend’s chop list.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Have you gone to the police?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Why not? I’m sure they’d love to hear your
story.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’d rather hear yours.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You are being foolish.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’m a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a
lifetime do you stare history in the face.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Why does he want to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: He sees me as a threat.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Concentrate!</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Harder. Concentrate harder.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Me arm hurts.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Again. Try again.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Harder! You swing like an impotent cow!</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had
an arm.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Impotent cow.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Muy Bien!</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Here my boy, from vineyards as sweet and
smooth as a young girl’s thigh.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: It will take less effort as you learn.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: It’s like to kill me first.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You have a gift. One you must protect.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: And what is this great gift that cannot be
seen or smelt?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: The Fabric of life. The spark that allows
the passing of existence from one generation to another.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: If that was meant to be an ex- planation
Mr. Romirez from Spain, I’m afraid you’ve failed.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Come. Enough sword play for an
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’re no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez. We’re
raised as riders.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What is the fascinatioon? It is only a
leaf.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: All living things pay dues, Conor. They
must be respected for that.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: As they age they contribute to a sum that
is the kindling from which all future life comes. To feel it, to know
it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I do not think I like the sound of that.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: It does not feel nearly as frightening as
it sounds. But the consequences of such feelings can be very
frightening. For it gives you great strength. The strength of
<em>knowledge</em>. The ability to stand between the giving of what has
always been to what will always be.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I feel hardly nothing.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You have not been fully trained. But you
will learn. And you will be good, I can feel that. You have apt- itude.
This is why our friend is so concerned.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: But why be so concerned about me?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: This power is divided amongst you, me, and
others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal. Some, like you
and he, have more. Much more.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: I am a small player. But if by helping you
I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has
meant something.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I am not ready for this.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You must be. You have responsibilities. You
must learn the rules. You can never attract attention to yourself, never
show the side that will draw others to you. You will always know when
you are in the presence of another. Beware. But more importantly Conor
MacLeod, will be your battle against time. In the coming years you will
see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat. People will become a transitory,
pathetic lot. The only constant you will know will be the others and the
tradition their greed and quest represent. But life without morality,
without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no
life at all. That is how the others exist. Nothing more than walking
corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the
last. Keep your soul sewed to the earth. Do not become one of them.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: You are young, inexperienced. You do not
know what time can do. How it can sap all pity, all love.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: That is not me.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man
can be much more dangerous than an evil one.</p>
<p><strong>villager</strong>: Conor!</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yes, Darin.</p>
<p><strong>villager</strong>: Hate to be bothering you like this, but me
mare threw a shoe.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Go ahead, Senor. I have my friend to keep
me company.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’ll be back when I can.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Romirez. What a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Madonna!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Oh, Santa Maria!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Why run?</p>
<p><strong>romirez</strong>: Demonio!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: To hell with you.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a
sling, don’t drag me into it.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: All I need is for you to check the name.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: You talked to your supervisor lately?
He’s burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight. That on
top of the cops bugging him.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’ll take care of that Corey, but I need
this now.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Corey, you <em>owe</em> me.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: It’s that important?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Wilson know about this?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’m doing it on my own.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Good way to lose your job.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Some job. Card filing and cabinet dusting.
Four years in this dump and I haven’t written anything for Wilson that a
wounded yak couldn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: I liked the bit you did about Baltic
chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’s bullshit. Everything. My job, the
people I get involved with, I’m up to here with it.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: You always were hard to impress.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Not who. What. Worstick’s a town in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Chris, have you seen my notebook?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Why, that son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What’s wrong Wilson, huh? Not enough
excitement in your own desk? What the hell were you looking for in
mine?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: A murder.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You better have a warrant. That’s my
notebook, you’ve got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I’ve got a morgue filling up with bodies.
That’s my right.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Well, the man of the hour that we all would
like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town. And all of a
sudden the Smithsonian’s ambulence chaser is an expert on missing
persons.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’m calling an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You and I should talk first.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: We’ve got nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: What are you going to tell them? That you’re
protecting a man who’s killed four people?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Four?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: All fashionably without heads.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Spare me the details.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: But there’s more. Wednesday someone played
javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware. Some locals
spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out
to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular
Richard Taupin.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What are you getting at, Moran?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: You’ve been a busy little beaver. Especially
with that records mess up in Church Hill. Your notes are very complete.
Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn’t rush right over and
tell us what you knew. In fact, we’re considering book- ing the
ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’ll never stick.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: But we might just give it the ’ole college
try. What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an
arraignment. But then, I’m sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows
all about that.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You’re an asshole, Moran.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I want Taupin.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What makes you so sure he’s the one?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Just for laughs we raided wonder boy’s house.
There was a gallon of one of the corpse’s blood in his carpet. I think
it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What’s all of this got to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: What were you doing in Felton?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Research. If your pal was there I never saw
him.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I have witnesses that can put the two of you
together.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Never take up poker, Detective.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Don’t be stupid, lady. Your neck can be
sliced as fast as anyone else’s.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Why don’t you wait until it comes out in
paperback?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I warned you.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You shouldn’t have come.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: We’re you followed?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: No one knows you’re here?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: No. I had to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You had to do <em>nothing</em>!</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You’re a fool.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Come inside.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Is this what you killed them with?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You’ve been listening to rumors.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Our cars were seen together in Felton.
They’re calling me an accessory to murder.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You are. Now.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: There’s several bedrooms down the hall. Take
your pick.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No, that’s the last place we saw her. Okay,
will do.</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What’s all that?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Richard Taupin has become cumbersome. It
would be best if he just disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You did kill those men.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Not all of them.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: When you finish, what then?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I go my way and you can write all you want
about the big bad Mr. Taupin.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You make it all sound so simple.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: The only real difficulty comes in changing
over the ownership of property I’ve aquired. That requires certain
records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in
Gettysburg. But that’s where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You want me to front for you.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: The less exposure I recieve around
government buildings the better. You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract
considerably less attention than I.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Not such a bad trade. The story of a
lifetime for a few days work?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: They lost her outside of Thurmont.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I want people in here to check over every
piece of this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Figure she’s with him?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: We ran down that Church Hill info. She’s
right. There is no Richard Taupin.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Any other I.D.s come up?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Not yet. Called FBI yesterday. Thompson’s
going to try CIA this afternoon. Y’never know.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Should have seen him the first night. Son of
a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn’t
even blink.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You’d think he’d had practice.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: I think he has.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: The men are assembled, Major.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: See that they are indeed ready, Dupont.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Yes General.</p>
<p><strong>staff sargeant</strong>: Regiment ready for review, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Stand straight, you are a soldier of the
King.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Where is your bayonet?</p>
<p><strong>solider #3</strong>: Lost it sir.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>staff sargeant</strong>: You heard the Major! Where!</p>
<p><strong>soldier #3</strong>: Whorehouse sir.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Your rifle. Hand it to me.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: The flint is cracked. No spark will reach
your powder. You will die tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Tomorrow you go to <em>battle</em>! And you
look like children! The General has charged me with seeing that you are
prepared, and prepared you will be! If necessary you stand here all
night! Sargeant!</p>
<p><strong>sargeant</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: See to it.</p>
<p><strong>sargeant</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Mulet.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: …And what a sight! That old mare just kept
falling over her own guts till someone finally shot her.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Complete your inspection?</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: They’re nothing but boys. It will be a
slaughter tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: I doubt much can change that. The enemy has
five brigades waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: We need more time.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Won’t get it. We are a sacrifice. A
diversion.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Eat up Dupont. It will probably be your
last.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Not likely.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I thought I gave orders the regiment was to
drill.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare
firewood for the break- fast cooking.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: What is your position?</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Second musketeer.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I understand you joined up in Bremen.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: You seem to understand a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I am a Major, Private. You would do well
remembering that when addressing me.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Excuse me, “sir”. I thought we spoke as
equals.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Equals?</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: If you wish to play games, Major.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Wait. I think we understand each other.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: We have no understanding.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Then it is time two of us did. You are very
young. I was once young. I can help.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Help? I’ve seen others “help”. Somehow a head
always ended up on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: It can be different. It must be.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: It never changes, Major.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: We must talk.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Stay out of it.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Don’t threaten me, Private.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Who do you think I am? One of your freckle
faced children waiting to die tomorrow? “Threaten you”? You and I just
living will always be a threat. Forever. Look at your life, Major. Look
at mine. Nothing there but threat. Threats and nothingness. It’s what we
live for.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Do not turn your back on me.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: You are really going to force this, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Either you are with me or against me.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: Have I a choice?</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: You see Major? You are not so different.</p>
<p><strong>mulet</strong>: You see Major? You are not so different…</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: I had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Who am I deceiving?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Certainly not me.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You needn’t look so flushed, Major. You are
quite safe in church.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: State of grace and all that.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Tradition.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: It’s all we have.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: All this time and still a scared little
boy.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Not so scared.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Perhaps not. You seem to have misplaced a
private. No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: No doubt.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You surprise me. Eliminating a rival like
that. Such are the actions of a man of conquest. I was mistaken. 300
years have turned the boy’s fear into ambit- ion.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I
can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you. Mulet, Romirez,
they were fools without vision. It was destined that the board would be
cleared for the real players.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Romirez understood. Not you.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Romirez is dust.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Finish your prayers?</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: Finish yours?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Our common heritage. I am your only real
friend, you know. The only one who truly understands you. I look forward
to the day we meet again. And I kill you.</p>
<p><strong>dupont</strong>: So sure?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You can’t stay in church forever.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Good night, Major.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Morning Mr. North</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Same.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Such a pretty day. If I live to be 90
I’ll never tire of mornings like this. Mind you I’m 74 now.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Yes sir. When you get older your
priorities change. It’s the simple things that count. Without them
growing old can be a very lonely thing.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I’m sure that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Here. The hook should go just below the
head, where the meat is toughest.</p>
<p><strong>grandson</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Show you a trick.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Fish are creatures of habit. They like their
food where they’re used to it. At the top, hiding in old leaves.</p>
<p><strong>grandson</strong>: Where did you learn that?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: My father taught me.</p>
<p><strong>grandson</strong>: Your father must be smart.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Yes, he was.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: There was a man once. Just a simple
woodcarver. But he understood. More than anyone he could see to the
heart of it. It never ends. Today is the same as the first. Tomorrow
will be the same as today. So much time. And all of it wasted. You love
history?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I wish I could.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.
Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: It will take some time for the forms to
clear before you go to Gettysburg.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Second thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: No. So what now? We just wait?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Well, as long as we’re stuck here.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’s some sort of party the town is
throwing.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: They do it each year.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I thought it might be a nice break from all
of this.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Maybe it would do us both good.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: There’s a catch. You’re supposed to wear
19th century clothing.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: My father was something of a junk
collector.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Here, try this. I suppose they’re still
making women the same as back then.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: A little dusty.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: A lion.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Oh please. Another one.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What would you like?</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Something pretty.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Like you.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: That’s wonderful. Where did you ever
learn it?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Far away.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You’ll be leaving the girl alone.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: David.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Do you have cause to bothering us?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: David, we’ve already spoken of this.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: He’s not what he pretends to be.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You best leave, son.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You think you’re so high and mighty,
coming into town and taking a man’s woman. Well I know about you. I know
about the things you do.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I said you best leave.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Ask him
about his friends. The ones he meets in the town square. Ask him about
the blade he keeps beneath his bed.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Leave. While you still can.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You don’t frighten me.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I should.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: No! Leave him. Please don’t hurt him.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: He’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: He’s not what you think!</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I don’t care who you are or where you
come from.</p>
<p><strong>katherine</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Mr. Taupin! Glad you could make it. Best
get some punch before it’s gone. Near the whole valley showed up.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: If I didn’t know better I’d say William
Taupin.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: His son. Richard.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Mr. Taupin is up from Washington to look
over his father’s estate.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Your father died some years ago. This is your
first visit?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I suppose a Taupin had to show up
eventually.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Good evening, Mrs. Butler.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What was all that about?</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Sorry Mr. Taupin. That’s not meant for
you. Just some didn’t take much to your father.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: My father was never one for social
whirls.</p>
<p><strong>mr. taupin</strong>: Kept to himself for sure. Then with all
that business in ’31.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What business?</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Family down the road from the Taupin
place was murdered. All cut up they were. Horrible. Two strangers were
also found with the bodies. No one ever accused William, but with his
reputation as a loner and the rumors about him and some of the wives in
town, folks just never forgot. Most were relieved when they heard he’d
died. Sorry Mr. Taupin.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Nothing to be sorry about.</p>
<p><strong>mr. north</strong>: Just your pappy scared some.</p>
<p><strong>portly</strong>: All right, the kids have had their fun. Now
it’s time for a little more traditional dancing.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I don’t know any of these. I’ll make a fool
of myself.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: William Taupin seems to have left his
mark.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: And you are William Taupin, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You’re using your son’s name.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: No. Just the child of some lonely girl I
gave a ride to. When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it.
Twenty years later I became the son.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: More punch?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Then you must be at least 70 years old.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: At least.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: It’s frightening sometimes the way you talk
about other people’s lives.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: A factor of age.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I hope I never get that old.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You won’t.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I must be insane. Leaving work, ditching
cops. All to follow a murderer. A very old murderer, but a murderer just
the same.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’ve been telling myself it’s the award
winning journal article I’m going to write. But it’s not. It’s you.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’m not even sure why.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Hardly a reason to run off with a
murderer.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: My life has been chock full of people with
complications and weak- nesses. I can’t stand it. But you’re different.
It’s in your hands. A clarity.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: You are a very perceptive young woman.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Just a little crazy.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Miss Cartwright, it’s time I showed you
something.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Miss Cartwright?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I had this room built some time ago.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: That would be difficult to explain.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: I’d like you to try.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I was born Conor MacLeod in the village of
Ardvrek on the High- land plain of Strathnaver in the clan of MacLeod
under the King of Scotland. On the eleventh of December, 1408.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I have served in the armies of twelve
nations, married nine women, fathered thirty-eight children and buried
them all.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I carried that rifle in World War I. This
book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria. The
diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.
Class of 1672. It goes on.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: That’s why Smith called you MacLeod.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: He knows about you.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: He is older than I.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What could possibly be worth all this murder
and distruction.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Sometimes I think it’s just for something to
do. A conquest to be the last. Something to hold onto while everything
else around you withers and blows away. Some- thing to replace the love
that can never work.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: That’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Perhaps. There is something more. An
inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Of bodies.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I didn’t kill the watchman.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You killed those other two.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Not the same.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What about that family in ’31?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Sometimes innocents become involved.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You and your buddy make a real team, don’t
you? Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up
all the innocents in between.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: There are differences.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You kill with your left hand?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I haven’t killed <em>you</em>.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Is that a threat?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Come here, Brenna.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Damn you.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: May God commend into his kingdom the soul
of our dear departed Jason, son of Katherine-</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: And brother to Howard and James-</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Katherine.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I owe him this.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: He never knew you.</p>
<p><strong>son #1</strong>: Is something wrong, Mother?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Howard. James. This is your father…</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: “Brenna”. In Celtic is means “woman with
raven hair”. Only chieftan’s daughters were allowed it.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What is it like? Being you?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Empty. And fear. Fear of those that would
kill you and fear of those that would love you. It can never last, and
in the end you always end up destroying both.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: But you’re known so much. History I’ll only
read about.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: It’s all the same. Half lives that never go
away.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: All of it finished.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Gettysburg’s an hour’s drive at most. You
should be back by nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Will I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Be careful. Don’t stay any longer than you
have to.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Won’t know till the records department
comes back with it this after- noon. Looks good though. They found the
receipt in his townhouse. It was pretty smeared but had Taupin’s father
listed as a signatory.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Round up who you can and put them on
standby.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Think we should call the local P.D. out
there first?</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: No. I want this to be all ours.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that’s all I need.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Just take this down the hall to the regis-
trar. Hurry up though, it’s near closing time. Most everyone’s gone home
already.</p>
<p><strong>clerk #2</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Do you have a drinking fountain?</p>
<p><strong>clerk #3</strong>: Around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Go away! Oh God, go away!</p>
<p><strong>knight’s voice</strong>: We have some unfinished
business.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Are you here?</p>
<p><strong>knight’s voice</strong>: I want you to come to me.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: And if I refuse?</p>
<p><strong>knight’s voice</strong>: Give me an address where I can
forward Miss Cart- wright’s head.</p>
<p><strong>knight’s voice</strong>: Yes laddie, I have her.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Should I care?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You have three hours.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Kahn sends his best.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You disappoint me. I thought you’d finally
gotten over that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Leave her out of this.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You can do better than that.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: It’s from over near the memorial.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>moran</strong>: Moran. All right, get a patrol unit out there
right away. I’ll meet them.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: No. Not now.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Brenna?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: This isn’t done. Get up.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: What’s the point! You have me, finish
it!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I have waited forever for this. You will not
cheapen it, little boy.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Tradition.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: It’s all we have.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to
play.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Be silent.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You will be silent!!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I do hope you’re enjoying this as much as
me.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: This is nothing that concerns you.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You will leave!</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Stop. You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: In mamus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum.
Auditorium nostrum in nomine Domine.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Requiescant in pace.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Conor.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: And now you know.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I can’t stand it. Oh God, I can’t stand
it!</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: The scream of your blood. The shriek of
trees. Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I’m the last. Oh Christ, I’m the <em>last
one</em>!</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: I’ll destroy you. I’ve destroyed everything
I’ve ever touched! Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: Conor…</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: <em>Get out</em>!</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: What are we supposed to say?</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: The emptyness. The years and years of void.
Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who
would have guessed?</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: The inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Not power. Not control.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Life. It is the gift and the under- standing
of life.</p>
<p><strong>brenna</strong>: You have lived forever.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: Life is only life when it is bounded by
death. The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be
part of the fabric. The inside. I love you Brenna.</p>
<p><strong>taupin</strong>: It will be horrible. The future. I may die
