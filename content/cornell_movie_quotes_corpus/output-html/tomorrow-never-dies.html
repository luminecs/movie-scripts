<h1 id="tomorrow-never-dies">tomorrow-never-dies</h1>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: There has to be an easier way to earn a
living.</p>
<p><strong>bond’s voice</strong>: Seven, in position.</p>
<p><strong>tanner’s voice</strong>: Roger, Seven.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: … What were you saying, Admiral? Something about
this ‘not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy
spy?’</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: - I’ll be sure to acknowledge 007’s
‘assistance’ in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a
naval operation.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin?</p>
<p><strong>general bukharin</strong>: ‘In a joint operation, someone’s
nose always gets put out of joint.’</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’m interested in success, Admiral. Not who gets
credit. Mr. Tanner: What have we got?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: A regular terrorist swap meet. Death at
discount: Two Chinese Long March Scuds, a pair of Soviet A-17 attack
helicopters -</p>
<p><strong>bukharin</strong>: Stolen -</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And the crates look like American M-16
assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel mines, six French Exocet missiles,
and 75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of Czech made C-4 Semtech
explosive. Something for everyone. Fun for the whole family.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: What about ID’s?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: One to seven: Deal the face cards.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Gustav Meinholtz. Neo-Nazi, former East
German STASI agent. Ties to the Beider-Meinhoff gang. Aces high, seven.
Bid to the east.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Vilko Barkoviac. Bosnian war criminal;
thought to be operating freelance out of Teheran. Full house, seven. Bid
to the North.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Sitoshi Isagura. Japanese religious fanatic.
Wanted for the Tokyo subway -</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: I’ve seen enough. Let’s finish
this. Tell your man to drop back. We’re initiating plan B -</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: But -</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: - Thank you, M. But this is more
than your man can handle. Are we in agreement?</p>
<p><strong>bukharin</strong>: - Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Admiral -</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: Command to Nelson: Authorization to
fire.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Weapons authorized. Prepare to fire. On my
count: Five. Four. Three. Two -</p>
<p><strong>firing officer</strong>: Cruise missile away -</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: I appreciate your assistance, M.
But this is now a military operation.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out
of there.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: One to seven: Exit target area. Repeat -</p>
<p><strong>bond’s voice</strong>: Seven to one. Negative. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear
specialist.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Meaning there may be nuclear material down
there?</p>
<p><strong>voice from warship</strong>: Time to target: Three minutes.
Target acquired. Weapon armed.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Who is that?!? What’s in the box??</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I don’t know. He’s not in the database -</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: What’s in the box, General? What’s in the
box???</p>
<p><strong>bukharin</strong>: … We usually… Transport… Weapons grade
uranium.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Will it go off?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Abort the cruise.</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: It’s too late -</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: One to seven - one to seven -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Negative, one. NOT YET.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one
kiloton.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Will the cruise set it off?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: Jesus. Can’t you people keep
anything locked up?</p>
<p><strong>general bukharin</strong>: We didn’t know it was missing.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Get me the Prime Minister. Alert NATO, the CIA,
the Pentagon. Seven: This is a direct order. I want you out of there. Do
you copy?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: God help him.</p>
<p><strong>voice from warship</strong>: Time to target: Thirty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>bond’s voice</strong>: Seven to base. I have a full house.
Your bid.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: By the way: Thank the General for all his
“assistance.” Over and out.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … And what do you call these?</p>
<p><strong>jenny wu</strong>: Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Indeed they are. Deadly little things.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And what do you call these? The Gang of
Two?</p>
<p><strong>jenny wu</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I was just getting to the interesting
part!</p>
<p><strong>jenny wu</strong>: We’ve already done the interesting part.
Do you forget?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Remind me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny wu</strong>: Sakwa!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?</p>
<p><strong>jenny wu</strong>: Mandarin. You jerk. I’m late. I have to
get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Hello - Hello.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Hello, James. I hope I’m interrupting
something important.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Not at all, Moneypenny. I was just brushing up
on a little Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: I’m sure she is, James. But I’m afraid
you’ll have to ‘kiss off’ the rest of your lessons this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Moneypenny… Here I was, finally getting a feel
for a new tongue -</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Four o’clock. M will meet you in the
conference room.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: 4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap
things up here.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Four o’clock. Don’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Tsi tien, Chien-penny.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Ah, James. You always were a cunning
linguist… Au revoir, mon cher.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Don’t tell. I don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Good afternoon, Professor Wu.</p>
<p><strong>jenny wu</strong>: Good afternoon. Are you sure you can’t
stay for the lecture?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I can’t. But I did enjoy the dress
rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>jenny wu</strong>: Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Tsi tien, Professor Wu.</p>
<p><strong>hnn anchor</strong>: You’re watching HNN, the Harmsway 24
hour news network. Coming up: Valentin Zukofsky’s stunning victory in
the Ukrainian Presidential elections… Live coverage of the latest HNN
communications satellite launch from Xichang China… And - A special
report on the situation in Hong Kong, since the Chinese take- over from
Great Britain.</p>
<p><strong>col. dominique everhart</strong>: To sum up: After analyzing
the tire inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6 video tape, NATO
believes the “red box contains approximately eighty kilograms of U235
weapons grade uranium - an incredibly hard, incredibly heavy, incredibly
lethal substance.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: And that’s enough enriched uranium to produce how
many nuclear devices?</p>
<p><strong>col. dqminique everhart</strong>: Depending on the builder’s
sophistication - one crude bomb that could devastate London, Paris, New
York, Berlin - or all four if they have the latest technology.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: And the participants?</p>
<p><strong>col. dominique everhart</strong>: Kim Dae Yung.
Moscow-trained North Korean nuclear weapons specialist; apparently fell
out of favor with the current North Korean regime after a botched
attempt to steal fissionable material from a British light-water reactor
in South Africa - an accident that left him entirely hairless…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Nothing like a little imperialism to promote
loyalty among the faithful.</p>
<p><strong>col. dominique everhart</strong>: In conclusion: Both these
men have a vendetta against the world. They are nuclear armed, and
dangerous. And having failed to get the UZ35 through the old opium route
- the Khyber Pass - it’s NATO’s belief that their next attempt will be
through Bulgaria - where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force will be there to
stop them.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Thank you Colonel Everhart. 007, I’d like to see
you in my office. Why don’t you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you
need more information?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes, M.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Interesting presentation.</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: Interesting video tape.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: They point, I shoot.</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: Do you have a pen? I just got promoted
and don’t have my new cards yet.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: … Does this do anything?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Depends what number you write.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Married?</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: Happily.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Kids?</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: Three. You? Married?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: Here. I gave you my assistant’s phone
number. If it’s urgent, she knows where to reach me.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Thanks. Take care -</p>
<p><strong>dominique</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Moneypenny! We’ve got to stop meeting like
this. They may be on to us.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: In the darkest moments, it’s what I live for.
Especially since I’ve heard how much you like to watch… On the hidden
camera.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: By the way, James: Ordinarily I would
never ask, but… Weren’t you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for
two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever
known me to kiss and tell?</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Actually, I’ve never known you to do
either… But -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: - We all want what we can’t have?</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Not all of us, 007.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What - no lust for adventure?</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: No, 007. It’s just that I’ve learned
from personal experience - that when we get what we want - Somehow the
reality is never as… Satisfying as the fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Don’t keep M waiting.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Come in, 007. You know the Minister?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Of course. Minister Johnstone.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: 007.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot
Harmsway?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Only what I read in the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: His newspapers?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Occasionally, yes. British media mogul. Born
in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books,
magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: - Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide
newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: ‘Able to topple governments with a single
story’ - as he says in his press.</p>
<p><strong>johnstone</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … What’s Harmsway done?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: It seems, 007, we’ve received a tip</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: A rumor - from an anonymous
source -</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: - that Sir Elliot may be involved with Stamper
and Yung, and the missing Uranium.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: Hearsay. Idle chatter from a
source you can’t identify - who insists on talking only to 007. Nothing
but loose talk and innuendo.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: That may be the case at present, Minister
Johnstone… But our own sources suspect that Mr. Harmsway used his
considerable Russian media - holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky
President of the Ukraine - in trade for the uranium.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: More scurrilous, unsubstantiated
gossip.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB
agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time
friend of the people. If you believe what you read in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: Need I remind the two of you
that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from
the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented
Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the
port “Aberdeen Harbor” in their honor?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: … No more than I need remind you, Minister, that
merely being a member of the lucky sperm club - does not preclude one
from a life of criminal activity.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was
to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost
discretion.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Which is also why I’ve withheld this information
from NATO and our allies.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Didn’t we once investigate Harmsway?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to
return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the
Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a
rather powerful enemy -</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: Not to mention the chaos it
caused at Whitehall when his newspapers began screaming for the recall
of the sitting government.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’m sending you to Venice, 007. You’re to check
out the source, determine whether Elliot Harmsway is involved with the
enriched uranium, and, if so, stop him.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How will I meet the informant?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: You’re to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival,
and wait to be contacted.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: There is one last thing, 007:
Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He’s
also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every
consideration.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Political considerations?</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: To the best of my recollection,
Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing. In fact, I was never here.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Would you send in the new man from equipment
branch?</p>
<p><strong>moneypenny</strong>: Right away.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …. I hate to ask, but… Did you ever think
you’d miss Communism?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: We serve the interests of the British people,
007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that
uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Hopefully, it won’t get that far.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Come in, Saunders.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket
in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Q’s retirement party. I’d just put the
knife into the cake, and -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Come on. I know better than that -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It must do something.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Well… If you insist.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The die is cast.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Now pay attention, 007. We haven’t much
time to demonstrate your new Q toys.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How is old Q?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Gone fishing.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Fishing?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Big game fishing. Sonar torpedoes.
Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: In the meantime, perhaps this will spark
your interest. Cigarette lighter. Thumb here, press here -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Saunders, I’ve lit cigarettes -</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Not from forty feet.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: The disposable lighter also contains a
small self-detonation charge Depending on who - or what - you wish to
dispose of.</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Stop fidgeting, 007. Next -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Shoelaces?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Plastique explosive shoelaces. Cut them to
regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the
detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Perfect way to tie up a… ‘Knotty’ problem?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Moving along - A typical plastic security
card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here - And a code breaking
microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere -
you’re in.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Does it work on cash machines?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: It was an authorized test. I returned the
money.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I see…</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here
for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep
hand becomes a Geiger counter.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: If you can’t do the time, don’t do the
crime?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last
thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective
device.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be
able to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>saunders</strong>: I believe Q’s exact words were:
“Hopefully, nothing.”</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …I’ll give you a ring from Venice.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Good luck on your mission, 007.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Till death do us part.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Buona sera, signore -</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Vino?</p>
<p><strong>masked woman</strong>: I may have been followed. Meet me at
the Church in five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Looking for someone?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Hello, James.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Paris?!? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Is that any way to say hello?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I thought your specialty was good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Oh, James. I’ve missed you -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Is this another one of your games?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Stop it! You’re hurting me! Can’t you just be
nice?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’ve got half the British government breathing
down my neck. I don’t have time for your nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Don’t you even miss me? Didn’t I mean
anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just
another one of your stunts?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: No! He’s crazy - he’s insane. He hates
everybody. He’s got these plans - You’ve got to help me, James. I’m
sorry. I’m sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you’ve got to
protect me. I know you still love -</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Do you feel better now?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What about the uranium?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: It’s on the boat. He’s holding a press
conference tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: I’m so sorry, James. I promise, I’ll never
leave you again.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Shhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Just hold me.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How do you know Harmsway?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Bastard! Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Nobody. Just some drunk. Leave him alone
-</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Take her to the boat.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: So that’s how he does it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Prego, prego. Permissio.</p>
<p><strong>tourist</strong>: Grazie.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Grazie -</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: Marco - I didn’t know -</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: After him!</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: I owe you some pain.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He fought hard… But the case was terminal.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You’ve confirmed all the legal details with
M?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Let’s go over this one more time.</p>
<p><strong>italian woman w/baby</strong>: Don Franco. I just want to say
we’re voting for you in the election.</p>
<p><strong>italian woman w/baby</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And you’ll wait until after the press
conference - and everyone is gone - before you board the boat and arrest
him.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …And so, it’s somewhat fitting that we are
here today… To christen this environmental research boat in Venice - -
‘Venezia’ - the port where Marco Polo sailed forth to explore the
world’s great uncharted oceans… That 2/3 of the earth’s surface where
the sharks are not working members of the press.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: With our six custom designed sea-bed
coring drills, we will probe the long-term effects of pollution; our
sonars, radars, and research labs will study the wind, the water, and
the sea life that so dearly feeds us.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: And so, in the spirit of international
cooperation - thanking my good friend, Valentin Zukofsky - the newly
elected President of the Ukraine for all his assistance -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I give this boat to mankind - selflessly -
in pure charity asking nothing for myself… But the cable TV rights.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Miss Venice? If you’ll do the honors -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Now I’ll take some questions from the
press - even the few of you who aren’t on my payroll.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Mr. Harmsway: Why did you name this
boat the Sea Dolphin II?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Actually, my first choice was ‘No
Comment.’ So if someone asked where I was, I could truthfully respond
‘No Comment.’ Over there.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Sir Elliot: Is it true you’re in
negotiations to move your offices from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: No comment.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Level one, secure.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: The maiden voyage begins tonight. I have
some business in London - but the ship will sail down the Nile, across
the South China Sea, stopping in Australia, winding up in San
Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>valentin’s voice</strong>: Mr. James Bond!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What is it that brings you to Venezia,
Mr. Bond? Business - Or somebody else’s business?</p>
<p><strong>sofia</strong>: Dimitri!!! You promised I could go
shopping!!</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: New mistress. So? Go!</p>
<p><strong>sofia</strong>: I need money.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Here. Take an inch.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Come. Let me buy you a drink. It’s
free.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Two vodka martini’s. Shaken. Not stirred.
And you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I must say, Valentin, capitalism seems to be
treating you well.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes.
Off the record.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Of course. If you can’t beat the government,
you might as well own it.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Wait - I want you to meet a friend of
mine. Elliot! Elliot! Come here.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce you
to an old friend -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The name is Bond. James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Always nice to meet one of her Majesty’s
fellow subjects… Especially one with such distinguished friends.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You might say I’ve always been one of
Mr. Valentin’s biggest followers.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: ‘Biggest followers?’ He’s practically made
a career’ of it!!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’s a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically
glows in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I can tell you’re a man with an eye for
exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond. Darling! Come here. I want you to meet
my wife.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce you
to James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: But then… I believe you two have already
met.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I think I suddenly remembered an urgent
meeting in Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: My friends, there’s been a terrible
mistake. Come. Let me show you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Paris -</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Leave me alone! He’s going to kill me!!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me? Why wasn’t it in our
files?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: He didn’t want anyone to know. He kept it out
of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image. You’ve got to
protect me!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Go to my hotel room. I’ll be there in twenty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Just - say it. Say it just once.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: One thing at a time. I’ll see you in twenty
minutes. Go.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I believe this is what you’re looking for,
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch -
It’s depleted uranium! Completely safe! A child could sleep on it.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I received it from the Russian government
- a by-product of their nuclear arms program - in the hopes that I could
create tools for oceanographic research. It’s what I was talking about:
‘Swords into plowshares’! The Sprit of International Cooperation!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go
upstairs, and enjoy the reception.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I hope you’ve enjoyed this little
charade.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Which part? The Colonel’s? Or yours?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don’t screw
with a man who buys ink by the ton. It’s deadlier than uranium.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Aren’t you late for a meeting?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The Danielli. Presto!</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: That was too close.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Don’t worry. Mr. Bond will get the
message. So will his boss.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I’m going to the plane. Tell the captain
to set sail at once.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Paris? Paris?</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: We’ve cleared Hong Kong harbor, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Position?</p>
<p><strong>gps officer</strong>: Two-two, zed-three, one-five north; a
hundred fourteen degrees, five minutes, ten seconds east.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Mark.</p>
<p><strong>gps officer</strong>: Locked on satellite, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Set course, two-ten degrees, south south
east.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Coming about, sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Orders from London: For the next ninety-six
hours, we’re to run on full radio silence. Double watches, full alert.
We’re to send one encrypted positioning burst to London every six hours
- otherwise, zero electronic emissions.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I’ll be in my cabin until oh-six- hundred
hours.</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: Captain leaving the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Attention all hands. Now hear
this…</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: We will rig immediately for
electronic silence. All electronic gear is to be shut down…</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: All personal radios, video devices
and computers will be stowed at once.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Check the engine baffles; rig the
generators for shielded operation.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Communications set to
receive only, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rating</strong>: Radar switched to passive mode; sonar re-set
to low-power operation. You couldn’t find our signature with a
magnifying glass.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Let’s hope so.</p>
<p><strong>second officer</strong>: Looks like we’re in for a long,
uncomfortable trip.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: We’ll all breathe a lot easier when
we get this cargo back to London.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: We’re in mid-procession: The last two place
roses in the casket…</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Good morning, Gentlemen. I’m sorry to
bring you here under these circumstances, but Considering our meeting
was already scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>number one</strong>: Sir Elliot: The entertainment division
is releasing three new animated children’s movies this year. By the time
we’re finished promoting them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper, and
magazine outlets - There won’t be a parent in the universe who won’t
feel guilty if they don’t take their children to our stores and theme
parks to buy the toys, books, video- games and clothing featuring our
‘lovable little creatures.’ We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Excellent, Number One. Build a better
rat-trap, and the world truly will beat a path to your theme park.
Number Two?</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: As you’re aware, Sir Elliot, our
software division has introduced a new computer operating system, Gates
’99. It’s deliberately filled with bugs - so people will be forced to
buy our upgrades over the next five years. The window on revenues is 2.8
billion.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Outstanding, Number Two. By the way -
Number Five - ? Who’s ahead in the American elections?</p>
<p><strong>number five</strong>: The Democrat, sir. By nine points.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Maybe it’s time to publish that story
about his sex life. Even things up. A close race is always better for
our TV ratings.</p>
<p><strong>number five</strong>: Consider him slimed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Splendid. Next… Number Three. Your
report?</p>
<p><strong>number three</strong>: I regret to inform you, sir, that
Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf
War.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …Haven’t we already paid him for his
services?</p>
<p><strong>number three</strong>: Yes, sir. But he still feels his
people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He
has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: … And there’s no truth that 10% of that
money will go into your Swiss bank account?</p>
<p><strong>number three</strong>: No sir! I swear! This is not
true!!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: You disappoint me, Number Three.</p>
<p><strong>number three</strong>: Please sir. Please -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …But because I am a just man, I’ve decided
to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Mr. Stamper will escort you to the
plane.</p>
<p><strong>number three</strong>: Thank you sir! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Good-bye, Mr. Azziz.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Let’s proceed with new business.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we are
going to initiate phase one of the word’s most perfect crime: The
biggest theft in the history of mankind. Right here. In the Strait of
Malacca.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Gum?</p>
<p><strong>number three</strong>: Thank you! Thank you so much. You must
thank Sir Elliot for me.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Here. Something to read on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>navigation officer</strong>: … This doesn’t make sense.
What’s our heading now?</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Zero one three. Due north.</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: We’re on course again.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Can’t see a damn thing in this fog.
Rating: What have we got?</p>
<p><strong>rating</strong>: A passenger ferry and two freighters
broadcasting on low-band -</p>
<p><strong>communications</strong>: And two small fishing boats about
30k north. No radar, but we’ve identified their engine signatures.</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Damn. It’s doing it again.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: About every ninety seconds, the auto-
pilot jogs us to the west.</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Then re-sets us to the north.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Not in the Strait. How’s our
position?</p>
<p><strong>navigating officer</strong>: According to the satellite,
we’re exactly on course.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Did you check the auto-pilot?</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: The back-up does the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Check it again. What about the global
positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the
signal?</p>
<p><strong>gps officer</strong>: Two words: Im-possible.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: How is it now?</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Seems to be back to normal, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sonar operator</strong>: I have something off the port
bow!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: A dead head. Water logged timber.
Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the
channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don’t usually
float this far west. Muncy! Engines to half!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Chew up a log like that in the
propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London.
Twice.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: I’m getting an electrical
emission, sir! Extremely close. Bearing 240 -</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Punch up the radar -</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: I’ve got it, sir. A large craft -
XX,OOO tons. Range - 200 yards? It’s anchored in a cove!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: That’s impossible! We’re in the
middle of the channel!</p>
<p><strong>junior officer</strong>: Breakers off the port bow! We’re
heading for shore!</p>
<p><strong>sonar officer</strong>: Sir -</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Full stop!!! Call the captain!</p>
<p><strong>sonar officer</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: What?!?!</p>
<p><strong>sonar operator</strong>: The log is moving!</p>
<p><strong>senior operator</strong>: We’ve been hit! We’re taking
water!</p>
<p><strong>damage control</strong>: Flooding in the engine room!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Get me damage reports! Start the
pumps!</p>
<p><strong>the captain</strong>: What the hell is going on?!?</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: I think we’ve been holed, sir!</p>
<p><strong>the captain</strong>: On my way!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: The engines are gone!</p>
<p><strong>damage control</strong>: Flooding on D deck!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Sound the general alarm! Seal all
compartments!</p>
<p><strong>systems officer</strong>: We’ve lost power!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Go to back up generators!</p>
<p><strong>damage control</strong>: Flooding on C-Deck!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Where the hell are those
generators?</p>
<p><strong>systems engineer</strong>: Coming up, sir!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Get those pumps working!</p>
<p><strong>systems control</strong>: The back-up is gone!</p>
<p><strong>damage officer</strong>: Flooding up to B-Deck!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: We can’t hold out much longer, sir!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Where the hell is the Captain?!?!</p>
<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: Slipping to stern!</p>
<p><strong>damage officer</strong>: All major compartments flooded!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Abandon ship! Break radio silence!
Send our position!</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: What’s our position?</p>
<p><strong>gps officer</strong>: One hundred degrees, thirty-one
minutes, and seven seconds East, by two degrees, twenty-nine minutes,
ten seconds, North.</p>
<p><strong>sonar operator</strong>: Six. That’s it? Only six of us?</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Most of the crew never made it to their life
jackets. The Captain?</p>
<p><strong>sonar officer</strong>: The First officer stayed on the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: Hey - look! Over there!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: We’ve decoded their last transmission.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Perfect. They’ll be searching miles from
here. Time for phase two. You can get the men in the water.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: You heard him. Get the men in the water!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I can’t believe it took us so long to finally
get together! What exactly do you do for the government?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You might say… ‘Public relations.’</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: How fascinating! I bet you meet all the most
fabulous people.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Excuse me - Mr. Bond? You have a
call.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Moneypenny! You’re early. You weren’t supposed
to call until - Yes. I understand. Twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: Good evening. I’ve just spoken
with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he’s expecting
a full update within the hour. For those of you still unaware, some
forty minutes ago -</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: Excuse me, but - I must formally
protest this meeting. Given the nature of what’s occurred - and the need
for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or
MI-6. This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the
officers of her Majesty’s Royal Navy.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: Admiral, are you suggesting
-</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sorry I’m late -</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Actually, you’re just in time. Admiral Roebuck:
You know Commander Bond, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’ve looked forward to meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: As I was saying: Approximately
forty- five minutes ago, we received an abandon ship signal from the
H.M.S. Indomitable. Looking at these infrared satellite images -
provided by Mr. Tanner of MI-6 -the ship is presumed lost here, just
south of Kuala Lumpur, where she broadcast her last position.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Divers approaching the hull.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: To the right, towards the stern.</p>
<p><strong>diver</strong>: It’s titanium. we can’t cut through.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Gentlemen: I do believe we’ve struck gold…
Four minutes ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: One-third of the British gold
reserves?!? What kind of idiot loses - What is it? The equivalent of ten
billion US dollars???</p>
<p><strong>treasury official</strong>: Give or take. Depending on
today’s currency rates -</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: What the hell was the gold doing
on that boat?</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: We were bringing it back from Hong
Kong. Under orders from the Treasury.</p>
<p><strong>treasury official</strong>: During the cold war, we stored a
third in America, and another third in Hong Kong - in case of a nuclear
attack. And with the turn-over of Hong Kong to the Chinese -</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: Why wasn’t the ship
protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: I resent your tone, sir. I have men
who are missing -</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: And I have the entire British
economy to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Minister - Obviously, MI-6 was not involved in
this operation. But I have to defend the Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: At least we know where the gold
is. When are the recovery ships due?</p>
<p><strong>admiral roebuck</strong>: 36 hours. They’ve already sailed
from the Persian gulf.</p>
<p><strong>minister johnstone</strong>: I expect to have that gold
recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I’m imposing my own electronic
silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the
CIA. …And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on
these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?</p>
<p><strong>roebuck</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Remember the golden rule, Mr. Stamper: He
who has the gold, rules.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Is the helicopter ready?</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Fueled and waiting.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Good. We have an appointment in Hong
Kong.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: …You’re turning into quite the politician,
007.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I have an excellent teacher. ‘Make sure you
wear the uniform’?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: What do you make of all this?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It doesn’t quite add up.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The infrared satellite images. No heat, no
flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did,
there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Sabotage?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: A three-thousand ton frigate doesn’t just
vanish into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: I’ve already contacted our station in Kuala
Lumpur. They’re lining up a local contact. I want you to find that gold,
and secure it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Didn’t Elliot Harmsway just move his
headquarters to Kuala Lumpur?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Contrary to what you may believe, 007, the world
is not filled with mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes, stock them with
big-breasted women, and threaten the world with nuclear
annihilation.</p>
<p><strong>general li</strong>: And that is the fifth document. With
your counter-signature, the sale will be complete.</p>
<p><strong>young chinese lawyer</strong>: Are you sure? If we waited
-</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: General Li: My young associate here has
just informed me that if I waited a year, I could perhaps receive a
higher price for this building. He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did
my ancestors. With obvious results.</p>
<p><strong>general li</strong>: …Most eloquently put, Sir Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Thank you, General Li. Now I’ll just sign
this last document -</p>
<p><strong>general li</strong>: Sir Elliot! Red ink -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Of course! How foolish. More bad luck.
I’ll just borrow yours -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: An old Chinese toast to our friends…</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Confusion to the enemy. In 48 hours, that
building - and all of Hong Kong around it - will cease to exist.</p>
<p><strong>crewman 1</strong>: Sounding: Bottom is thirty fathoms.</p>
<p><strong>crewman 2</strong>: Nothing. Negative bounce.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We should be right over it.</p>
<p><strong>operator 2</strong>: Wait - I’m getting something.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>operator 2</strong>: Not sure yet -</p>
<p><strong>operator 2</strong>: The Shinjuku. Japanese troop carrier.
World War II.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Let’s make another pass.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: We have traffic on the deck -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>young male assistant 1</strong>: Good morning Sir Elliot!
Welcome to Kuala Lumpur -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Morning, morning all. What have we
got?</p>
<p><strong>executive secretary</strong>: The Canadian Prime Minister
wants to set a lunch -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Pencil it in for the next trip -</p>
<p><strong>executive secretary</strong>: The American presidential
candidate called to complain about that sex story -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution,
and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -</p>
<p><strong>executive secretary</strong>: Your bankers want an answer
about the Brazilian TV stations</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: No -</p>
<p><strong>executive secretary</strong>: The Queen invited you to dinner
-</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Yes -</p>
<p><strong>executive secretary</strong>: And the 9:30 news meeting is
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Morning, all my golden retrievers. What
kind of havoc shall we create in the world today?</p>
<p><strong>news editor 1</strong>: - A ferry sank and burned in
Pakistan; 457 dead.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>news editor 2</strong>: American jetliner down in Omaha -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>news editor 3</strong>: Economic summit ends in Tokyo -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Boring -</p>
<p><strong>news editor 1</strong>: Riots broke out at the World Cup
soccer finals -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Dog bites man. Man bites dog is a news
story. Riots at the World Cup soccer finals is a social announcement.
Next?</p>
<p><strong>news editor 4</strong>: This just came in: There’s something
up with the British Navy in the Strait. Rescue planes, helicopters; two
ships supposedly sailing from the Persian gulf. They just chased away
one of our news boats.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>news editor 4</strong>: Yeah. Sounds like a plane went down
or something… Either way, they’re calling it - all together now:</p>
<p><strong>all at table</strong>: “A routine training exercise.”</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I’m shocked!! Issue the usual vehement
protest: Freedom of the press, people’s right to know… Lather it up with
a lot of righteous indignation. Next?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Still nothing?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Commander Bond: They’ve found one of the
crewman’s bodies!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Yo! Jimbo!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Wade, what the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I am not here, ol’ buddy. The CIA has
absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it
was going, or when it left Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: That’s reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Hey - the world is my office.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Let’s take a look at the body.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Smells like… Coffee plants.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Colorful… Shark attack?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I don’t think so. The veins are cauterized -
as if they were sealed by heat… But there are no burn marks on the
flesh. It doesn’t make sense. Who found the body?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Dato. Local fisherman. Says it came
in with the tide early this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Ask him if it could have washed in from the
west side of the Strait.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: No. He says it’s not possible. The
current could have only brought the body in from the east.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You have a boat?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I don’t know if you’d call it a boat…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Something with an engine? Not oars?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Step into my office.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What do you want with the Harbor Master?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Tide and current charts. Work backward from
the body - find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips
out of Bangkok. Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of
hand grenades.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I think I’ve just seen my next future
ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Not if you kill us first - unless that’s how
you plan to leave Muffy.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened to that
girl - in Cuba - ?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Natalya?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: She married a hockey player.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I envy your ‘undercover’ assignments.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We work in the dark. We do what we can.</p>
<p><strong>harbor master</strong>: Wind, tide, currents… You’re the
second person today asked for a full set of charts. If you’d just sign
here -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Thanks. By the way - was there anything
strange the night before last? Odd weather, lost boats - ??</p>
<p><strong>harbor master</strong>: No… Unless you’re talking about the
bus problem.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …Bus problem?</p>
<p><strong>harbor master</strong>: Captain Cheong’s ferry was late. He
runs the line across the Strait between here and Sumatra. The lumber
mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus. Slept on
the docks. Hundreds of them.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I have to get these to London. Do you know
this Captain Cheong?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht
club.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Can you arrange a meeting?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Hell. The CIA built that club.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Okay gentlemen. The name of the game is 7-card
Cambodian stud. Everything is wild!</p>
<p><strong>captain cheong</strong>: In the Strait of Malacca, when a
boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo;
smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.</p>
<p><strong>captain cheong</strong>: Sometimes kill the crew; other times
- Torture them.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>captain cheong</strong>: The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles
off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was
drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite
positioning receiver?</p>
<p><strong>captain cheong</strong>: Next morning. Both boats. Nothing
wrong. My 90 year old grandfather thinks ‘Ghost in the computer -
Silicon Dragon.’</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I appreciate your time -</p>
<p><strong>captain cheong</strong>: Maybe you should talk to Sidney
Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the
Strait.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where can I find him?</p>
<p><strong>captain cheong</strong>: Him? He, is a she - at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Bourbon. Neat.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I wonder if you handle your liquor more
carefully than you handle your boat.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Sometimes, you just have to plunge into
things. Be reckless.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your
wake.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed
in the harbor. James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Sidney Winch.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another
for you?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No. But you can buy a drink for my friend,
Taro.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Chaperone. I’m waiting for my dinner
date.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Pity. Bring him whatever he wants.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur,
Mr. Bond? Wait - don’t tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor
little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Actually, I’m here on business. You might say
it was a… Golden opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: And exactly what business are you in,
Mr. Bond?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Insurance. Lloyds of London.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: The Strait can be a very dangerous place,
Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn’t
carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’ll keep that in mind.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I see my date is here. And I think Mr. Bond
is ready to leave.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Nice to run into you again.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Let’s not make it a habit.</p>
<p><strong>taro</strong>: I think you should go -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Not quite yet, Taro -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Uncle Elliot!!</p>
<p><strong>taro</strong>: I said you should -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred - What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He tied one on.</p>
<p><strong>girl one</strong>: Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>girl two</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>girl three</strong>: He’s arrived.</p>
<p><strong>q’s voice</strong>: You’re late 007. I’ve been expecting
you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Q! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Retired. I’m not getting paid to help you save
the world anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’m sorry. It was a national emergency -</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: That hardly makes up for the imposition. Now, for
what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007. First,
computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical
influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship’s coordinates here.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Do you have any idea of what any of that
means? In English?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Not a clue. I didn’t lose the ship. Next, your
new personal communicator. Picture-phone, fax, beeper.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Do I have to dial ‘9’ to get out?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: I don’t care who you dial, so long as it’s not
me. Next -</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Your new car.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: - Four wheel drive?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the
road. All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns - Fully
operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse - Stop that! Plus
infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17
beverage cup holders.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … 17 Beverage cup holders?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Standard equipment. The world’s automobile
manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide
the most beverage cup holders.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather
well in your retirement.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Don’t even think about it. 007. They’re my
granddaughters.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Slow down. We’re close.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I dunno, Jimbo. It can’t be out here. How
could they get this far off course?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who knows? Fog, night…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: They’d never sail this close to the shore.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Wait a minute - I’ve got it. There! Off the
port bow!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Cut the engines! It’s about two- hundred fifty
feet down.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Two-fifty’s pretty deep for air. You should
really be using mixed gases.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’ll make a bounce dive. If I can keep my
bottom time short, I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Keep your eye out for pirates.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I got you covered.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: That’s reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>taro</strong>: Uzi beats knife.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …Interesting point.</p>
<p><strong>taro</strong>: Get him up. Take his belt. Take the two of
them to the Captain.</p>
<p><strong>taro</strong>: By the way. I almost forgot. I owed you
one.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Smell that Jimmy? Sea Kelp.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Hey - it could be worse. At least they speak
English.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …Somehow, that’s not reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>taro</strong>: Here they are, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Just give me one goad reason - Mister Bond,
from Lloyds of London - why I shouldn’t kill both of you, burn your
boat, and use your bodies for shark bait.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: So you two know each other!?! Small world,
ain’t it? What happened? Commitment problems?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sidney Winch, meet -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division.
If you’re ever lookin’ for a sweet refinance on the boat -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: - Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks
she’s on a ‘seduce and destroy’ mission through life… …But she won’t
kill us.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: No. First, because I don’t think it’s in your
nature. And second, because there’s no gold down there.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: So charming! So suave! Don’t insult me. I’m
not one of your ‘little London girls’ who falls for the lies.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: So it was commitment!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong knows
what’s on that boat and I’m claiming it. One-third of that gold is
mine.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: That’s fine, but - even a little London girl
knows that one third of nothing is still nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Was he carrying anything?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Search him.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Do I have to do everything around here?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I hope you’ll be gentle.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Think about mom.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Unusual technique.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: And what do you call this?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: - The family jewels?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: …I don’t know. I’m not sure -</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: Boss! We got company - comin’ up off the
starboard bow!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Bring them.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Attention sea barge: Lay down your
weapons, and prepare to be boarded.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and
prepare to be boarded.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: If I were you -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: - You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Just remember: They think there’s ten billion
dollars in gold down there.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Thank you. “Now hear this: Drop dead.”</p>
<p><strong>the cruiser’s gatling gun erupts with an eardrum-shattering
salvo.</strong>: It’s only a warning shot, but -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Gatling gun beats Uzi.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Who’s in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I am. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: You have precisely one minute to
pull up your anchor and be under way.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Forget it. No way. I got here first.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Who’s Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: That would be me -</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Thanks for your message. And you’re
Bond?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes -</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them
to the cutter!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Wait a minute -</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Get them out of here. If he says one
word, shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Captain Morton.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: My name is Sidney Winch, and -</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Good for you, Miss Winch. You now
have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I know my rights. These are international
waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I’m claiming it. Under
international law, I have the right to salvage what’s on that wreck.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should
consider hiring an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I was an attorney!</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above
that profession. Ten seconds. Are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: You leave me no alternative.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Cut her anchor.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You won’t get away with this!</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you
to get some steam up - before you run aground.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You bastards! Believe me - you haven’t heard
the last of me!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: - Nice trick with the arrest. Very
convincing.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: It’s no trick, Mr. Wade. I’ve got
half a mind to throw both of you in the brig.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Don’t you think you’re overreacting?</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: Yes. The famous James Bond. I’ve
heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an
observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed
CIA cowboy - Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and
then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …That’s all well and good, Captain, save for
one thing: There’s no gold down there.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: What are you talking about? We went
through all this and the ship isn’t even down there?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>captain morton</strong>: That’s absurd! It took two squads of
forty men fifteen days to load that gold.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I know what I saw -</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I don’t care what you think you saw. You’re
a damned amateur. Just get off my ship. Go back to your trench-coats and
your code names - and leave the job to professionals.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Aye-aye, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Where to now, Jimbo?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’m not certain… But I think there’s someone I
want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p><strong>unknown. “status</strong>: SECURE.”</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Bond.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway’s voice</strong>: Hello, Mister Bond.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Elliot Harmsway! I heard you were in K.L.
and thought we might get together for a chat…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: How did you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the
information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency,
you can have any piece of information. Besides I own the phone company.
What do you say? Twenty minutes?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Let’s find out exactly what he knows.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway.</p>
<p><strong>pr woman</strong>: Yes. I’m to bring you right up. The valet
will take your car -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’d prefer to park it myself. Temperamental.
Practically has a mind of its own.</p>
<p><strong>pr woman</strong>: Don’t they all?</p>
<p><strong>pr woman</strong>: Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>pr woman</strong>: Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon
editions. If you’ll just follow me -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sir Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Come. Let’s get out of the noise. - I’ll
give you a tour of the building, then we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: It’s funny, Mr. Bond. Of all the things I
own, nothing gives me as much enjoyment as my newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes… A man with ink in his veins, and blood on
his hands.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: We print 31 newspapers here; another
two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite plants around the world.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … And how many of those newspapers carried
Paris Harmsway’s obituary?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: All of them, Mister Bond… After you?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Before I became involved with Paris, she
was always involved with the most inappropriate’ men… Playboys. Thrill
seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in
her.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I tried to save her. But she remained a
manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior… Delusions of
grandeur.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I wonder if it runs in the family.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: The only difference between a psychopath
and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Still, I do miss her. I only wish she
could have lived to see all this.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I can feel your pain.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: By the way - what is it that brings you to
Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sightseeing.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I call this the Rogue’s gallery.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes. I can see: You’ve hung the rest of your
relatives.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: My third great Uncle - the Earl of
Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. His
son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running
opium into Shanghai… His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium…
And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and
published the colony’s first English newspaper. It was a city of
unlimited possibility.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: So why did you leave?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Because it’s a dying city. Since the
Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow? In any case, this
is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and
television stations. Said I’d never amount to anything, but… I turned it
into this</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.
Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:
News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:
2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news
networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35
languages.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And still not a thing to watch.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …Although it must be fun to have all those
satellites.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: They’re merely tools to disseminate
information.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Or disinformation… If you wanted to, say, beam
down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should
buy it for a book! It’s totally preposterous, but - You amuse me. …And
now perhaps I can amuse you.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Let’s see… First we have this James Bond…
I believe he’s a field adjuster for Lloyd’s of London…</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Then we have this James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: … Licensed to Kill… Not a bad title for
that book… Or perhaps you’d prefer this James Bond -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Who I believe they call “007.”</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men
of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons;
satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right
hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …Words to live by?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Your choice. Look at the time! Come.
There’s someone I want you meet - about a story I’m thinking of
publishing.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Hello, dear. I’m sorry I took so long
-</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: That’s okay, Uncle Ell -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What is HE doing here?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I see you two have met.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Briefly.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Don’t pout, Sidney. I invited him here
hoping he might shed some light on your story. He’s from ‘Lloyd’s of
London.’ …Aren’t you, Mr. Bond?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: He’s not going to tell the truth! He was
diving for the gold!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch has
told me the most incredible story: A sunken British warship filled with
gold; a British cutter firing on her; billions of dollars in bullion
lying on the bottom of the Strait.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Obviously, the British government denies
all of this -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: - I told you! He was there! -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: - But as I’ve explained to Sidney, without
proof, there’s just no story. Don’t you agree Mr. Bond?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: But I have proof! You ran out of here so
fast, I didn’t get to show you.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …And what’s that, my dear?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: He brought that up from the wreck.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …I see.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sidney, I wouldn’t -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: And what about this? Any idea what this
is?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: … I believe it’s a depleted uranium drill
bit, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Why don’t we just take these -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …Well! I do believe this requires further
investigation!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Thank you, Uncle Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: No matter what the British government
says, I won’t kill this story. Miss Oxford will show both of you to the
elevator… And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than
later.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’m sure they will.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Good-bye, Mister Bond.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Good-bye, darling.</p>
<p><strong>executive secretary</strong>: Thank you both for coming
in…</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Do you have a gun?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the
car.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: That’s funny: you struck me as the kind of
man who always carries protection.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Listen to me! I’m a British secret service
agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of
us.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Has anyone ever suggested that you’re a
paranoid psychotic?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold.
It’s on the Sea Dolphin II. And thanks to your little show and tell - -
giving him the evidence - We’re the only ones who can tie him to the
crime.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Blood or Dutch?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: He was my father’s best friend!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He’s killed closer.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You are seriously deranged.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Maybe. But why are we going up instead of
down?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sidney, come with me -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Not if my life depended on it.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Thank God! He’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Does he have a gun?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Good -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: This is a mistake!</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Help me up.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … I’d try the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: The stairs! Attention all units! They’re on
the 71st floor!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Stamper! They’re not to leave this
building alive!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: This has got to be a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: The only mistake is that they didn’t kill us
in the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No. I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: I don’t see them - There!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Warn him!</p>
<p><strong>voice on radio</strong>: Porter! They’re behind you -</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Roger! Over and -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Okay. So it wasn’t a mistake. What do we do
now? Offer them dinner?!?!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Come here. You shoot. I’ll cook.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Aim that way.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Shoot back!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: One second -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … How did you get into marine salvage?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: My father left me the business.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I used to be a divorce lawyer in New York
City.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Not a lot of difference.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Either way, you’re taking the goods from dead
hulks.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Let’s go -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What the hell does that do?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Cleans dirt. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: It’s a trick! After him. They’re in the
south stairwell!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Get more men up there!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Down?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Up.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Down?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Up.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: … And so much for that. They’re on the
72nd floor set-back. Nowhere to go.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: That should buy us some time.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Help me move this.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’ll call for a battering ram -</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: No. Get the fire ax.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We’ll go down close to the sky bridge. We may
be able to swing over and use it for cover.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No way. I sail. I do not fly.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Sometimes, you just have to take the
plunge.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: All I know is one thing: If we get out of
here alive, that gold is mine. I’ve earned it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: One thing at a time.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What now? And don’t give me some movie
clich� like ‘trust me.’</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Let’s go -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: We’re going to bounce off that thing!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: They’re on the bridge. Seal off the 50th
floor!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I should have hired this man. Get somebody
up there!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What about the elevators?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We tried that already. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You know, this is as much your fault as it
is mine.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sidney, we don’t have time for this -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Sure! Just when I want to talk - Not that I
would have believed you -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Put your back to the railing. Sit up on
it.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs
around my waist.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: … We have time for that?</p>
<p><strong>bond looks up</strong>: Stamper has commandeered a second
window washer’s rig, and is descending, FIRING AT THEM.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sometimes you just have to -</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Don’t say it.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Is this - like - a normal day for you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: It’s a lousy job, but - The only reason I stay
is for the health benefits.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: They’re heading for the press room. Stop
them!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: He was bad news.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Down there!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding
performance.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I think they’d rather know who stole their
gold.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Why, I did, of course. It’s on the Sea
Dolphin II, twenty miles outside of Hong Kong… Not that it will do
either of you any good to know. Now both of you: Stand up. And toss the
gun out, Mr. Bond.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Uncle Elliot: How could you do this to
me?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Oh, please, Sidney. There’s a hundred
billion dollars at stake. Besides, I never really liked your father that
much. He cheated at cards.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Are your guards really going to kill a
helpless girl?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond.
This is their chance to get even with the formerly ‘Great’ Britain. Now
both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What did you do, Harmsway? Make some deal with
the Chinese government for the gold?.. Was the radioactive uranium I
found in Venice part of it?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Questions, questions, Mr. Bond… Which I’m
afraid I’ve neither the time, nor the inclination to answer. Take them
out to the jungle and -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I forgot to mention: The job comes with a
car.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Kill it! Shoot the damn thing -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Here. You shoot. I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: …You know, that’s another reason you’re
probably not in a successful relationship.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Another reason??? Did I miss something???</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You insist on calling all the shots. And by
the way: I am not a helpless girl.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Aim that way.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Ready? Now!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Seal the garage! Cut the power! He’s got
no headlamps!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: We’re not going to make it!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: If it’s radio controlled, it’ll break the
code.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: If not?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: We blast through.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: - Built to withstand a nuclear blast. Are
they alive?</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Yes. Shall we kill them?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: No. I have a better idea. In fact,
Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan. Bring them both to
Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>asian male news reporter</strong>: As part of our continuing
report on terrorism, we’re outside Hong Kong’s Aberdeen Harbor nuclear
power plant…</p>
<p><strong>chin</strong>: Totally secure. Without codes, you’d need a
missile to blast through the front door; you normally can’t even get
this close without a full security clearance.</p>
<p><strong>asian male news reporter</strong>: …Could you say that a
little closer to the microphone?</p>
<p><strong>chin</strong>: Of course. You’d need -</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Get the machine in the water!</p>
<p><strong>power plant guard</strong>: What happened out there?</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: A generator blew. Nothing to worry about. But
I need one last shot of you. Why don’t you stand by the alarm?</p>
<p><strong>power plant guard</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Up the stairs!</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Put on your clothes. Cuff him.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: I’m sorry to interrupt again. But we need one
more picture for the story.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Why don’t you line up against the wall? Let’s
make it a group shot.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Next time, I do the driving.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: The drill is in the water; approaching the
intake tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I see you’re in your natural element,
Harmsway: A room filled with lethal power… …With a toxic core at its
center.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney… You’re just
in time for a nuclear meltdown!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You bastard -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Please, Sidney. I’d like to remember you
fondly.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Approaching the first gate.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Start the grinders.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: …So that’s what the weapons grade uranium was
for.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of
minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor… And
when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: - Instant melt-down.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Chernobyl will look like a campfire.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: We’re through the first gate. Approaching the
second -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Why, Harmsway? Wasn’t stealing the gold
enough?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Bore through. …They used to say living
well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond. They’re wrong. Revenge is the best
revenge.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to
target -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What could you possibly have to be vengeful
for, Harmsway? Still trying to prove yourself to daddy?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: You have to leave -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: A hundred and fifty years ago, my
ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it
into the greatest city known to modern civilization. And now that I’m
being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same
condition: A barren, lifeless rock. The gold is merely reparations -
payment from the spineless British government who wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … I think Uncle Elliot is having his own
melt-down.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Approaching the third gate -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Smash through it! Laugh all you’d like,
Mr. Bond - but you fit perfectly in to my plans. Here. This just in.
Newsflash. Read all about it.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear meltdown…
British agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway calls for
British government to resign.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …As the advertising says: Tomorrow never
lies.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: What about the gold?</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: You must go. Now. Otherwise the boat won’t be
out of range -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Thirty seconds. That’s the most brilliant
part of the plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy, I’ll let the new
British government - my British government - announce that the gold was
irradiated in Hong Kong - where no one will be able to touch it for a
hundred years. And just by coincidence:</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: …Gold mine opens in Vietnam. Let’s go. Put
them in the airlock.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You’ll never get away with it, Harmsway. Too
many people know.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the crazies -
the conspiracy theorists? The Oliver Stones of the world? I’ll publish
their books, I’ll make their movies, I’ll put them on my TV shows!
They’re my bellboys. They carry my luggage.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Now. Get them in the airlock.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And the
handcuffs. They’ll give it away.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No. I want to stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: How sweet.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: My timing always was lousy.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I’d rather die alone.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We’ll
drown her at sea.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Enjoy the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: I’ll meet you on the boat, south of Lantau
Island.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Take the men. I can finish alone.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: You come with me - You stay here.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: We’ll cut through the last gate, then set it
on auto-pilot.</p>
<p><strong>yung</strong>: Check it out. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Any news?</p>
<p><strong>the captain</strong>: The call just went out on the Hong Kong
police radio: Fire at the power plant.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Alert the media!</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: What do you want me to do with her?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: - Can’t we make a deal? I won’t say anything
-</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: You’re so cute, my dear. But I’m afraid
not. Put her in the storage room.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: We’ll get rid of her when we’re in
International waters. Set sail, full speed, due south. I’ll be in my
cabin. Let me know when Mr. Yung arrives. We’ll break out the
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Don’t get any ideas.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: It’s him. They both made it.</p>
<p><strong>the captain</strong>: I’ll tell Sir Elliot.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: He’s approaching from the north,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: Fantastic. Invite the crew on deck to
celebrate, and I’ll be up in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: He seems to be coming in awfully fast.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: Get the guns! It’s not him! It’s
Bond!!!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>the captain</strong>: I don’t know sir -</p>
<p><strong>bond hooks both of them with the skids, by the back of their
untucked</strong>: SHIRTS!!!! The man are flailing like crazy as -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: It’s Bond!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Kill him! Finish it!</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: You’re mine now.</p>
<p><strong>stamper</strong>: I’m going to do this slowly -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Stamper! Report in!</p>
<p><strong>harmsway’s voice</strong>: Report to the bridge!</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I never believe what I read in the
newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: Pity you’ll miss your obituary.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where is she, Harmsway?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: You want to kill me, Bond? Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where is she Harmsway? -</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: What is it, Bond? You haven’t the
guts?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: You spineless paper tiger -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Where is she, Harmsway?!? Or did you kill her
like Paris?</p>
<p><strong>harmsway</strong>: We all go down together!!!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What do you mean, you’d rather die
alone?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: I didn’t say when I want to die -</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Yes???</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond,
from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: … Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: First, that boat is in international waters.
I’m claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And number two?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: If you think we’re going to have some kind
of ‘life affirming’ romance here just because we cheated death, let me
be clear: We’re going to have it where I want, and when I want.</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: And when might that be?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: … As usual, I see the situation is in 007’s very
capable hands.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Life is not fair.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the message
went to London.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Tell me, Q-ster. You do ever do any
gardening?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: …The only thing I ever planted was bugs.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Moneypenny, take the following release: The body
of Sir Elliot Harmsway was found floating in the South China Sea this
morning, at 08:00 hours local Hong Kong time. At present, local
authorities believe the media mogul committed suicide.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: James… Is this really what a typical day is
like for you?</p>
<p><strong>bond</strong>: Yes… But some days… Are longer than
others.</p>
