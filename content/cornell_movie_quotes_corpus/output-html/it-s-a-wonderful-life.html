<p><strong>gower’s voice</strong>: I owe everything to George Bailey.
Help him, dear Father.</p>
<p><strong>martini’s voice</strong>: Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my
friend Mr. Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey’s voice</strong>: Help my son George tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bert’s voice</strong>: He never thinks about himself, God;
that’s why he’s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ernie’s voice</strong>: George is a good guy. Give him a
break, God.</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>janie’s voice</strong>: Please, God. Something’s the matter
with Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu’s voice</strong>: Please bring Daddy back.</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: Hello, Joseph, trouble?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Looks like we’ll have to send
someone down � a lot of people are asking for help for a man named
George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: George Bailey. Yes, tonight’s his
crucial night. You’re right, we’ll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: That’s why I came to see you, sir.
It’s that clock-maker’s turn again.</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: Oh � Clarence. Hasn’t got his
wings yet, has he? We’ve passed him up right along.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Because, you know, sir, he’s got the
I.Q. of a rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: Yes, but he’s got the faith of a
child � simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: You sent for me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth
needs our help.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Splendid! Is he sick?</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: No, worse. He’s discouraged. At
exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking
seriously of throwing away God’s greatest gift.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then
I’ve only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: You will spend that hour getting
acquainted with George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Sir… If I should accomplish this
mission � I mean � might I perhaps win my wings? I’ve been waiting for
over two hundred years now, sir � and people are beginning to talk.</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: What’s that book you’ve got
there?</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: Clarence, you do a good job with
George Bailey, and you’ll get your wings.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Poor George… Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Sit down? What are…</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: If you’re going to help a man, you
want to know something about him, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Well, naturally. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Well, keep your eyes open. See the
town?</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Where? I don’t see a thing.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Oh, I forgot. You haven’t got your
wings yet. Now look, I’ll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see
something?</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Why, yes. This is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: If you ever get your wings, you’ll
see all by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Oh, wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yippee!!</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Hey, who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: That’s your problem, George
Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: A boy?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: That’s him when he was twelve, back
in 1919. Something happens here you’ll have to remember later on.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And here comes the scare-baby, my kid
brother, Harry Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not scared.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m coming, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Make a chain, gang! A chain!</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: George saved his brother’s life that
day. But he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear. Cost him his
hearing in that ear. It was weeks before he could return to his after-
school job at old man Gower’s drugstore.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Potter!</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Who’s that � a king?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: That’s Henry F. Potter, the richest
and meanest man in the county.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So long!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee- haw.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wish I had a million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hot dog!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Hello, George. ’Lo, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello, Violet.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Two cents worth of shoelaces?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: She was here first.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m still thinking.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Shoelaces?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Please, Georgie.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I like him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You like every boy.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Help me down?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Help you down!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Made up your mind yet?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll take chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: With coconuts?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t like coconuts.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You don’t like coconuts! Say, brainless,
don’t you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here � from Tahiti �
Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A new magazine! I never saw it before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Of course you never. Only us explorers can
get it. I’ve been nominated for membership in the National Geographic
Society.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is this the ear you can’t hear on? George
Bailey, I’ll love you till the day I die.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m going out exploring some day, you watch.
And I’m going to have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives.
Wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: George! George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: You’re not paid to be a canary.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Gower, do you want something…
Anything?</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Anything I can do back here?</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll get them, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Take these capsules over to Mrs. Blaine’s.
She’s waiting for them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there,
haven’t they, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Ummmm…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is it a charge, sir?</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Yes � charge.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Gower, I think…</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Aw, get going!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you
headin’?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Some other time, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: There’s a squall in there that’s
shapin’ up into a storm.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Uncle Billy… telephone.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Bank examiner.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Bank examiner! I should have called him
yesterday. Switch it inside.</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: I’m not crying, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Well, you’re begging, and that’s a whole lot
worse.</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: All I’m asking is thirty days more…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Pop!</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Just a minute, son. Just thirty short days.
I’ll dig up that five thousand somehow.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Shove me up…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Pop!</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Have you put any real pressure on those
people of yours to pay those mortgages?</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these
people are out of work.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Then foreclose!</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: I can’t do that. These families have
children.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Pop!</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: They’re not my children.</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: But they’re somebody’s children.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Are you running a business or a charity
ward?</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Well, all right…</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Not with my money!</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Mr. Potter, what makes you such a
hardskulled character? You have no family � no children. You can’t begin
to spend all the money you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: So I suppose I should give it to miserable
failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s not a failure! You can’t say that about
my father!</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: George, George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re not! You’re the biggest man in
town!</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: Run along.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bigger’n him!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bigger’n everybody.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Gives you an idea of the Baileys.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t let him say that about you, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>bailey</strong>: All right, son, thanks. I’ll talk to you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Why, that medicine should have been there an
hour ago. It’ll be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Where’s Mrs. Blaine’s box of capsules?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Capsules…</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir, I…</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: What kind of tricks are you playing, anyway?
Why didn’t you deliver them right away? Don’t you know that boy’s very
sick?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re hurting my sore ear.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: You lazy loafer!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Gower, you don’t know what you’re doing.
You put something wrong in those capsules. I know you’re unhappy. You
got that telegram, and you’re upset. You put something bad in those
capsules. It wasn’t your fault, Mr. Gower…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just look and see what you did. Look at the
bottle you took the powder from. It’s poison! I tell you, it’s poison! I
know you feel bad… and…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t hurt my sore ear again.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: No… No… No…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t hurt my ear again!</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Oh, George, George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Gower, I won’t ever tell anyone. I know
what you’re feeling. I won’t ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Oh, George.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: An overnight bag � genuine English cowhide,
combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs…</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, Joe. Now,
look, I… I want a big one.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: What did you stop it for?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: I want you to take a good look at
that face.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Oh, you mean the kid that had his
ears slapped back by the druggist.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: That’s the kid.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: It’s a good face. I like it. I
like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the
pills?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Not a soul.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Did he ever marry the girl? Did he
ever go exploring?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Well, wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Big - see! I don’t want one for one night. I
want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for
labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand… a great big one.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don’t suppose
you’d like this old second- hand job, would you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now you’re talkin’. Gee whiz, I could use
this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No charge.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if
you said no charge.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s my name doing on it?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: A little present from old man Gower. Came down
and picked it out himself.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He did? Whatta you know about that � my old
boss…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What boat you sailing on?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m working across on a cattle boat.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: A cattle boat?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, I like cows.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Gower… Mr. Gower… thanks ever so much
for the bag. It’s just exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Aw, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, it’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: Hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh… Oh. Wish I had a million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hot dog!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Avast there, Captain Cook. You got your
sea legs yet?</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: Parlez-vous francais? Hey, send us
some of them picture postcards, will you, George?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Hey, George, don’t take any plugged
nickels.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.
George waves up at them and continues on across the street.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, Ernie!</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Hiya, George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi, Bert.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ernie, I’m a rich tourist today. How about
driving me home in style?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Sure, your highness, hop in. And, for the
carriage trade, I puts on my hat.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That’s
some dress you got on there.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Oh, this old thing? Why, I only wear it when
I don’t care how I look.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: How would you like…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Want to come along, Bert? We’ll show you the
town!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: No, thanks. Think I’ll go home and see what
the wife’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Family man.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: George! Harry! You’re shaking the house
down! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Oh, let ’em alone. I wish I was up there with
them.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Harry’ll tear his dinner suit. George!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s why all children should be girls.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: But if they were all girls, there wouldn’t
be any… Oh, never mind. George! Harry! Come down to dinner this minute.
Everything’s getting cold and you know we’ve been waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>george’s voice</strong>: Okay, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Here’s a present for you, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and
have dinner.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ve eaten.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, aren’t you going to finish dressing
for your graduation party? Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t care. It’s George’s tux.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: If you lay a hand on me, I’ll hit you with
this broom.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Annie, I’m in love with you. There’s a moon
out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy � my last meal at the
old Bailey boarding house.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, my lands, my blood pressure!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Pop, can I have the car? I’m going to take
over a lot of plates and things.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What plates?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, Mom � I’m chairman of the eats committee
and we only need a couple of dozen.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, no you don’t. Harry, now, not my best
Haviland.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy
and I are going to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m going to miss you, too, Pop. What’s the
matter? You look tired.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I thought when we put him on the Board of
Directors, he’d ease up on us a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wonder what’s eating that old money
grubbing buzzard anyway?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Oh, he’s a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick
in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has
anything that he can’t have. Hates us mostly, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Gangway! Gangway! So long, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: So long, son.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Got a match?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Very funny. Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Put those things in the car and I’ll get
your tie and studs together.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming
later, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean, and be bored to death?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Couldn’t want a better death. Lots of pretty
girls, and we’re going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I hope it works.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: No gin tonight, son.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Aw, Pop, just a little.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: No, son, not one drop.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Boys and girls and music. Why do they need
gin?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Father, did I act like that when I graduated
from high school?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could
send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half
the night.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We have that all figured out. You see,
Harry’ll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years,
then he’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: He’s pretty young for that job.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, no younger than I was.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Maybe you were born older, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose
you’ve decided what you’re going to do when you get out of college.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, well, you know what I’ve always talked
about � build things… design new buildings � plan modern cities � all
that stuff I was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Still after that first million before you’re
thirty.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I’ll settle for half that in cash.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Of course, it’s just a hope, but you wouldn’t
consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I… Annie, why don’t you draw up a
chair? Then you’d be more comfortable and you could hear everything
that’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I would if I thought I’d hear anything worth
listening to.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You would, huh?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: I know it’s soon to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, now, Pop, I couldn’t. I couldn’t face
being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, Pop. I didn’t mean that
remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your
life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe…
I’d go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: You know, George, I feel that in a small way we
are doing something important. Satisfying a fundamental urge. It’s deep
in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and
we’re helping him get those things in our shabby little office.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know, Dad. I wish I felt… But I’ve been
hoarding pennies like a miser in order to… Most of my friends have
already finished college. I just feel like if I don’t get away, I’d
bust.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Yes… Yes… You’re right, son.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You see what I mean, don’t you, Pop?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: This town is no place for any man unless he’s
willing to crawl to Potter. You’ve got talent, son. You get yourself an
education. Then get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Pop, do you want a shock? I think you’re a
great guy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, did you hear that, Annie?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I heard it. About time one of you lunkheads
said it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think
I’ll get dressed and go over to Harry’s party.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Have a good time, son.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know my kid brother, George. I’m going to
put him through college.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Here comes George. Hello, hee-haw!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When
did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, this afternoon. I thought I’d give the kids
a treat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Old college graduate now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah � old Joe College Wainwright, they call
me. Well, freshman, looks like you’re going to make it after all.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Harry! You’re the guy I want to see. Coach has
heard all about you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He has?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah. He’s followed every game and his mouth’s
watering. He wants me to find out if you’re going to come along with
us.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I gotta make some dough first.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, you better make it fast. We need great
ends like you � not broken down old guys like this one.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hee-haw!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hee-haw!</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: George, welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Putting a pool under this floor was a
great idea. Saved us another building. Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of
fun. There’s lots of stuff to eat and drink. Lots of pretty girls
around.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Hey, George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Violet.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Hello, what am I bid?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hiya, Marty. Well, it’s old home week.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Do me a favor, will you, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Momma wants you, Marty.” “Momma wants you,
Marty.” Remember?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dance with her, will you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh… me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough
already, with all these kids.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her
one time and you’ll give her the thrill of her life.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Aw, go on.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, sis.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, excuse me, Violet. Don’t be long,
Marty. I don’t want to be a wet nurse for…</p>
<p><strong>freddie’s voice</strong>: And the next thing I know, some guy
came up and tripped me. That’s the reason why I came in fourth. If it
hadn’t been for that…</p>
<p><strong>freddie’s voice</strong>: …that race would have been a cinch.
I tried to find out who it was later…</p>
<p><strong>freddie’s voice</strong>: …but I couldn’t find out. Nobody’d
ever tell you whoever it was because they’d be scared. They know…</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: …what kind of…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You remember George? This is Mary. Well, I’ll
be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well… Well… Well…</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: Now, to get back to my story, see…</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: Hey, this is my dance!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, why don’t you stop annoying people?</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: Well, I’m sorry. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, hello.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello. You look at me as if you didn’t know
me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’ve passed me on the street almost every
day.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary
Hatch. That wasn’t you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oyez � oyez � oyez… The big Charleston
contest. The prize? A genuine loving cup. Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m not very good at this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay � what can we lose?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: What’s the matter, Othello � jealous? Did
you know there’s a swimming pool under this floor? And did you know that
button behind you causes this floor to open up? And did you further know
that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack? And I’ve got the
key?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They’re cheering us. We must be good.</p>
<p><strong>george and mary</strong>: Buffalo Gals can’t you come out
tonight. Can’t you come out tonight. Can’t you come out tonight. Buffalo
Gals can’t you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hot dog! Just like an organ.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And I told Harry I thought I’d be bored to
death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to
knock down three people to get this stuff we’re wearing here. Here, let
me hold that old wet dress of yours.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do I look as funny as you do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I guess I’m not quite the football type.
You… look wonderful. You know, if it wasn’t me talking I’d say you were
the prettiest girl in town.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, why don’t you say it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe I will say it. How old
are you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you
were seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Too young or too old?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes,
sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I mean, without a dress. You look older… I
mean, younger. You look just…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sir, my train, please.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Your… your caboose, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You may kiss my hand.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ummmmm…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey � hey, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: As I was lumbering down the street…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, then, I’ll throw a rock at the old
Granville house.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, no, don’t. I love that old house.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. You see, you make a wish and then try
and break some glass. You got to be a pretty good shot nowadays,
too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, no, George, don’t. It’s full of romance,
that old place. I’d like to live in it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In that place?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wouldn’t live in it as a ghost. Now watch…
right on the second floor there.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’d you wish, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful,
Mary. I know what I’m going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next
year and the year after that. I’m shaking the dust of this crummy little
town off my feet and I’m going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the
Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I’m coming back here and go to college
and see what they know… and then I’m going to build things. I’m gonna
build air fields. I’m gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high.
I’m gonna build bridges a mile long…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you gonna throw a rock?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, that’s pretty good. What’d you wish,
Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Buffalo Gals, can’t you come out tonight…</p>
<p><strong>mary and george</strong>: …can’t you come out tonight, can’t
you come out tonight. Buffalo Gals can’t you come out tonight and dance
by the light of the moon.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’d you wish when you threw that
rock?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come on, tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If I told you it might not come true.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is it you want, Mary? What do you want?
You want the moon? Just say…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …the word and I’ll throw a lasso around it
and pull it down. Hey, that’s a pretty good idea. I’ll give you the
moon, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll take it. And then what?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, then you could swallow it and it’d all
dissolve, see? And the moonbeams’d shoot out of your fingers and your
toes, and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes!! Why don’t you kiss her instead of talking
her to death?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Why don’t you kiss her instead of talking her
to death?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Want me to kiss her, huh?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong people.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come on back
out here, and I’ll show you some kissing that’ll put hair back on your
head. What are you…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, I give up. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Over here in the hydrangea bushes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here you are. Catch.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a
very interesting situation.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please give me my robe.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hmm… A man doesn’t get in a situation like
this every day.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d like to have my robe.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Gesundheit. This requires a little thought
here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George Bailey! Give me my robe!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve heard about things like this, but I’ve
never…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Shame on you. I’m going to tell your mother on
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, my mother’s way up the corner there.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll call the police.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They’re way downtown. They’d be on my side,
too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m going to scream!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe I could sell tickets. Let’s see. No,
the point is, in order to get this robe… I’ve got it! I’ll make a deal
with you, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: George! George! Come on home, quick!
Your father’s had a stroke!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary… Mary, I’m sorry. I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, George, let’s hurry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Did you get a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Yes, Campbell’s there now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: I think that’s all we’ll need you for,
George. I know you’re anxious to make a train.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I have a taxi waiting downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: I want the Board to know that George
gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past
few months. Good luck to you at school, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: Now we come to the real purpose of
this meeting � to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter
Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Mr. Chairman, I’d like to get to my real
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Wait just a minute now.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Wait for what? I claim this institution is
not necessary to this town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to
dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to
the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: George, you hear what that buzzard…</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Mr. Chairman, it’s too soon after Peter
Bailey’s death to discuss chloroforming the Building and Loan.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Peter Bailey died three months ago. I second
Mr. Potter’s motion.</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: Very well. In that case I’ll ask the
two executive officers to withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: But before you go, I’m sure the whole
board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of Peter
Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: It was his faith and devotion that are
responsible for this organization.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: I’ll go further than that. I’ll say that to
the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Oh, that’s fine, Potter, coming from
you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Peter Bailey was not a business man. That’s
what killed him. Oh, I don’t mean any disrespect to him, God rest his
soul. He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common
sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop…
You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his
taxi. You know… I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he
comes here and we’re building him a house worth five thousand dollars.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have
all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for
his character.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: A friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: You see, if you shoot pool with some
employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A
discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all
because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and
fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just a minute � just a minute. Now, hold on,
Mr. Potter. You’re right when you say my father was no business man. I
know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan,
I’ll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything
against his character, because his whole life was… Why, in the twenty-
five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once
thought of himself. Isn’t that right, Uncle Billy? He didn’t save enough
money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few
people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what’s wrong with that?
Why… Here, you’re all businessmen here. Doesn’t it make them better
citizens? Doesn’t it make them better customers? You… you said… What’d
you say just a minute ago?… They had to wait and save their money before
they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until
their children grow up and leave them? Until they’re so old and broken-
down that they… Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five
thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble
you’re talking about… they do most of the working and paying and living
and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and
pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my
father didn’t think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a
warped, frustrated old man, they’re cattle. Well, in my book he died a
much richer man than you’ll ever be!</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: I’m not interested in your book. I’m talking
about the Building and Loan.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know very well what you’re talking about.
You’re talking about something you can’t get your fingers on, and it’s
galling you. That’s what you’re talking about, I know. Well, I’ve said
too much. I… You’re the Board here. You do what you want with this
thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly
one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come
without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Sentimental hogwash! I want my motion…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Boy, oh, boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy. You shut his big mouth. You should have heard him.</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: What happened? We heard a lot of
yelling.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Well, we’re being voted out of business
after twenty-five years. Easy come, easy go.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Here it is, “Help Wanted �
Female.”</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: You still want me to hang around, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Hey, you’ll miss your train. You’re a
week late for school already. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wonder what’s going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Oh, never mind. Don’t worry about that.
They’re putting us out of business. So what? I can get another job. I’m
only fifty-five.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Fifty-six!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Go on � go on. Hey, look, you gave up
your boat trip, now you don’t want to miss college too, do you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: George! George! They voted Potter
down! They want to keep it going!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Whoopee!</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: But they’ve got one condition � only
one condition.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: That’s the best part of it. They’ve
appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father’s
place.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy…</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: You can keep him on. That’s all right.
As secretary you can hire anyone you like.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Dr. Campbell, now let’s get this thing
straight. I’m leaving. I’m leaving right now. I’m going to school. This
is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he’s your man.</p>
<p><strong>dr. campbell</strong>: But, George, they’ll vote with Potter
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: I know. I know. He didn’t go.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: That’s right. Not only that, but he
gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college.
Harry became a football star � made second team All American.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Yes, but what happened to
George?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: George got four years older, waiting
for Harry to come back and take over the Building and Loan.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, there are plenty of jobs around for
somebody that likes to travel. Look at this. There… Venezuela oil fields
� wanted, man with construction experience. Here’s the Yukon, right here
� wanted, man with engineering experience.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thar she blows. You know what the three most
exciting sounds in the world are?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is
served; dinner…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors,
and train whistles.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Peanut?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s the professor now! Old professor,
Phi Beta Kappa Bailey! All American!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, if it isn’t old George Geographic
Explorer Bailey! What? No husky dogs? No sled? Uncle Billy, you haven’t
changed a bit.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Nobody ever changes around here. You
know that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, am I glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Say, where’s Mother?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s home cooking the fatted calf. Come on,
let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, wait. Wait… Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ruth Dakin.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I wired you I had a surprise. Here she
is. Meet the wife.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Well, what do you know � wife.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, how do you do. Congratulations.
Congratulations. What am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Harry, why didn’t you tell somebody? What’s
a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of
mine?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you. It’s purely mercenary. My
father offered him a job.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Oh, he gets you and a job? Well,
Harry’s cup runneth over.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: George… about that job. Ruth spoke out of
turn. I never said I’d take it. You’ve been holding the bag here for
four years, and… well, I won’t let you down, George. I would like to…
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy’s voice</strong>: It was a surprise to me. This
is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew’s wife. Old, old friend of the
family.</p>
<p><strong>ruth’s voice</strong>: Oh, of course. I’ve heard him speak of
you.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy’s voice</strong>: And I want to tell you, we’re
going to give the biggest party this town ever saw.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Here, have some popcorn. George, George,
George… that’s all Harry ever talks about.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ruth, this… what about this job?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Oh, well, my father owns a glass factory in
Buffalo. He wants to get Harry started in the research business.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is it a good job?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Oh, yes, very. Not much money, but a good
future, you know. Harry’s a genius at research. My father fell in love
with him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And you did, too?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so good
I could spit in Potter’s eye. I think I will. What did you say, huh? Oh,
maybe I’d better go home.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Where’s my hat? Where’s my…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Oh, thank you, George. Which one is
mine?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The middle one.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old
boy. Now, look � if you’ll point me in the right direction… would you do
that? George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right down here.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Old Building and Loan pal, huh…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now you just turn this way and go right
straight down.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: That way, huh?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy’s voice</strong>: I’m all right. I’m all right.
“… the sweetest flower that grows…”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: That’s for nothing. How do you like
her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Looks like she can keep Harry on his
toes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Did you know that Mary Hatch is back
from school?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Came back three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Nice girl, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Kind that will help you find the
answers, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Oh, stop that grunting.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Can you give me one good reason why you
shouldn’t call on Mary?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure � Sam Wainwright.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes. Sam’s crazy about Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Well, she’s not crazy about him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it
with you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well then, how do you know?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Well, I’ve got eyes, haven’t I? Why,
she lights up like a firefly whenever you’re around.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: And besides, Sam Wainwright’s away in
New York, and you’re here in Bedford Falls.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And all’s fair in love and war?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: I don’t know about war.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mother, you know, I can see right through
you � right back to your back collar button… trying to get rid of me,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, here’s your hat, what’s your hurry?
All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I’ll go out and
find a girl and do a little passionate necking.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: Oh, George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now, if you’ll just point me in the right
direction… This direction? Good night, Mrs. Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Now, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I think I got a date. But stick around,
fellows, just in case, huh?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We’ll wait for you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Hello, Georgie-Porgie.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Vi.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: What gives?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I’ll probably end up down at the
library.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: George, don’t you ever get tired of just
reading about things?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes… what are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you game, Vi? Let’s make a night of
it.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Oh, I’d love it, Georgie. What’ll we do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Let’s go out in the fields and take off our
shoes and walk through the grass.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then we can go up to the falls. It’s
beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there’s a green pool up there,
and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the
pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and… we’ll stay up there
the whole night, and everybody’ll be talking and there’ll be a terrific
scandal…</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: George, have you gone crazy? Walk in the
grass in my bare feet? Why, it’s ten miles up to Mt. Bedford.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: You think just because you…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, just forget about the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What are you doing, picketing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing
by.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Have you made up your mind?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: About coming in. Your mother just phoned and
said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My mother just called you? Well, how did she
know?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Didn’t you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I didn’t tell anybody. I just went for a
walk and happened to be passing by…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you… went for a walk, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll be downstairs, mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch’s voice</strong>: All right, dear.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, are you coming in or aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I’ll come in for a minute, but I
didn’t tell anybody I was coming over here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: When did you get back?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’d you get that dress?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s all right. I thought you’d go back to
New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations,
but I don’t know… I guess I was homesick.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Homesick? For Bedford Falls?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, and my family and… oh, everything. Would
you like to sit down?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, for a minute. I still can’t
understand it though. You know I didn’t tell anybody I was coming
here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Would you rather leave?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I don’t want to be rude.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, then, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Some joke, huh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I see it still smells like pine
needles in here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “And dance by the light…”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the matter? Oh, yeah… yeah…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It was nice about your brother Harry, and
Ruth, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh… yeah, yeah. That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t you like her?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, of course I like her. She’s a
peach.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, it’s just marriage in general you’re not
enthusiastic about, huh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, marriage is all right for Harry, and
Marty, and Sam and you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch</strong>: Mary! Mary!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch’s voice</strong>: Who’s down there with you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s George Bailey, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch’s voice</strong>: George Bailey? What’s he
want?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Me? Not a thing. I just came in to get
warm.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s making violent love to me, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch’s voice</strong>: You tell him to go right back
home, and don’t you leave the house, either. Sam Wainwright promised to
call you from New York tonight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But your mother needn’t… you know I didn’t
come here to… to… to…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What did you come here for?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. You tell me. You’re supposed
to be the one that has all the answers. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, why don’t you go home?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s where I’m going. I don’t know why I
came here in the first place! Good night!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good night!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch’s voice</strong>: Mary! Mary! The telephone! It’s
Sam!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch</strong>: Mary, he’s waiting!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I forgot my hat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: Aw, great. Gee, it’s good to hear your
voice again.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, well, that’s awfully sweet of you, Sam.
There’s an old friend of yours here. George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You mean old moss-back George?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, old moss-back George.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: Hee-haw! Put him on.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wait a minute. I’ll call him. George!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hatch</strong>: He doesn’t want to speak to George, you
idiot!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He does so. He asked for him. Geo… George, Sam
wants to speak to you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, George Baileyoffski! Hey, a fine pal you
are. What’re you trying to do? Steal my girl?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean? Nobody’s trying to steal
your girl. Here… here’s Mary.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I
want to talk to both of you. Tell Mary to get on the extension.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here. You take it. You tell him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mother’s on the extension.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We can both hear. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We’re listening, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: I have a big deal coming up that’s
going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini’s
bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of
soybeans?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah… soybeans. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: Well, Dad’s snapped up the idea. He’s
going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Rochester? Well, why Rochester?</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: Well, why not? Can you think of
anything better?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I don’t know… why not right here? You
remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can
get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was
thrown out of work when they closed down.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: That so? Well, I’ll tell him. Hey, that
sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you’d come through. Now, here’s the
point. Mary, Mary, you’re in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any
money?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Money? Yeah… well, a little.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: Well, now listen. I want you to put
every cent you’ve got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a
job for you; that is, unless you’re still married to that broken-down
Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I’m
letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary… Mary…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: Would you tell that guy I’m giving him
the chance of a lifetime, you hear? The chance of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He says it’s the chance of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now you listen to me! I don’t want any
plastics! I don’t want any ground floors, and I don’t want to get
married � ever � to anyone! You understand that? I want to do what I
want to do. And you’re… and you’re…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, Mary… Mary…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George… George… George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary…</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Here they come!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bailey</strong>: First Harry, now George. Annie, we’re
just two old maids now.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You speak for yourself, Mrs. B.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: If either of you two see a stranger around
here, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, look! Somebody’s driving this cab.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to
float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, look at this. Champagne!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good old Bert.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: By the way, where are you two going on this
here now honeymoon?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where are we going? Look at this. There’s
the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I feel like a bootlegger’s wife. Look!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know what we’re going to do? We’re going
to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda.
The highest hotels � the oldest champagne � the richest caviar � the
hottest music, and the prettiest wife!</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: That does it! Then what?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then what, honey?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: After that, who cares?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That does it � come here.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Don’t look now, but there’s something funny
going on over there at the bank, George, I’ve never really seen one, but
that’s got all the earmarks of a run.</p>
<p><strong>passerby</strong>: Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the
bank, you better hurry.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George, let’s not stop. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please, let’s not stop, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how are
you? Charlie? What’s the matter here, can’t you get in?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come on in, everybody. That’s right, just
come in.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now look, why don’t you all sit down. There
are a lot of seats over there. Just make yourselves at home.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: George, can I see you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why didn’t you call me?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I just did, but they said you left.
This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right now, what happened? How did it
start?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: How does anything like this ever start?
All I know is the bank called our loan.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: About an hour ago. I had to hand over
all our cash.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All of it?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Every cent of it, and it still was less
than we owe.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Holy mackerel!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: And then I got scared, George, and
closed the doors. I… I… I…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The whole town’s gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Yes, hello? George… it’s Potter.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: George, there is a rumor around town that
you’ve closed your doors. Is that true? Oh, well, I’m very glad to hear
that… George, are you all right? Do you need any police?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Police? What for?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you
know. George, I’m going all out to help in this crisis. I’ve just
guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs. They’ll close
up for a week, and then reopen.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He just took over the bank.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: I may lose a fortune, but I’m willing to
guarantee your people too. Just tell them to bring their shares over
here and I will pay them fifty cents on the dollar.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Aw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter?
Well, you’re going to miss this one.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: If you close your doors before six P.M. you
will never reopen.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I
wanted to be there.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah… …you can take this one off now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now, just remember that this thing isn’t as
black as it appears.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I have some news for you, folks. I’ve just
talked to old man Potter, and he’s guaranteed cash payments at the bank.
The bank’s going to reopen next week.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: But, George, I got my money here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did he guarantee this place?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, no, Charlie. I didn’t even ask him. We
don’t need Potter over here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll take mine now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, but you… you… you’re thinking of this
place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money’s not
here. Your money’s in Joe’s house… …right next to yours. And in the
Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin’s house, and a hundred others. Why,
you’re lending them the money to build, and then, they’re going to pay
it back to you as best they can. Now what are you going to do? Foreclose
on them?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I got two hundred and forty-two dollars in
here, and two hundred and forty-two dollars isn’t going to break
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are. You sign
this. You’ll get your money in sixty days.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sixty days?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, now that’s what you agreed to when you
bought your shares.</p>
<p><strong>randall</strong>: Tom… Tom, did you get your money?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>randall</strong>: Well, I did. Old man Potter’ll pay fifty
cents on the dollar for every share you got.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Fifty cents on the dollar!</p>
<p><strong>randall</strong>: Yes, cash!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original
agreement. Now give us sixty days on this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay, Randall.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: Are you going to go to Potter’s?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Better to get half than nothing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait… now listen… now
listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of
this Building and Loan there’ll never be another decent house built in
this town. He’s already got charge of the bank. He’s got the bus line.
He’s got the department stores. And now he’s after us. Why? Well, it’s
very simple. Because we’re cutting in on his business, that’s why. And
because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of
rent he decides.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn’t
you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you
for that broken-down shack? Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year
when things weren’t going so well, and you couldn’t make your payments.
You didn’t lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let
you keep it? Can’t you understand what’s happening here? Don’t you see
what’s happening? Potter isn’t selling. Potter’s buying! And why?
Because we’re panicky and he’s not. That’s why. He’s picking up some
bargains. Now, we can get through this thing all right. We’ve got to
stick together, though. We’ve got to have faith in each other.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: But my husband hasn’t worked in over
a year, and I need money.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: How am I going to live until the bank
opens?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I got doctor bills to pay.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I need cash.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can’t feed my kids on faith.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How much do you need?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey! I got two thousand dollars! Here’s two
thousand dollars. This’ll tide us over until the bank reopen. All right,
Tom, how much do you need?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Two hundred and forty-two dollars!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over till
the bank reopens.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll take two hundred and forty-two
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’ll close my account.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Your account’s still here. That’s a
loan.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay. All right, Ed?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I got three hundred dollars here, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Aw, now, Ed… what’ll it take till the bank
reopens? What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well, I suppose twenty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Twenty dollars. Now you’re talking. Fine.
Thanks, Ed. All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How much do you want?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: But it’s your own money, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Never mind about that. How much do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: I can get along with twenty, all
right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Twenty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: And I’ll sign a paper.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You don’t have to sign anything. I know
you’ll pay it back when you can. That’s okay. All right, Mrs. Davis.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. davis</strong>: Could I have seventeen-fifty?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Seven… Bless your heart, Of course you can
have it. You got fifty cents? Seven…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: We’re going to make it, George. They’ll
never close us up today!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Six… five… four… three… two… one… Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We made it! Look… … look, we’re still in
business! We’ve still got two bucks left!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, let’s have some of that. Get some
glasses, Cousin Tilly. We’re a couple of financial wizards.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Those Rockefellers!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Get a tray for these great big important
simoleons.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: We’ll save them for seed. A toast! They
raise their glasses.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A toast! A toast to Papa Dollar and to Mama
Dollar, and if you want the old Building and Loan to stay in business,
you better have a family real quick.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: I wish they were rabbits.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wish they were too. Okay, let’s put them
in the safe and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: Wedding cigars!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh-oh… wedding! Holy mackerel, I’m married!
Where’s Mary? Mary… Poor Mary. Look, I’ve got a train to catch. Well,
the train’s gone. I wonder if Ernie’s still here with his taxicab?</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: George, there’s a call for you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, will you get my wife on the phone?
She’s probably over at her mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that’s my wife! Here, I’ll take it in here. Mary?
Hello. Listen, dear, I’m sorry… What? Come home? What home? Three-twenty
Sycamore? Well, what… whose home is that? The Waldorf Hotel, huh?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, this is the company’s posters, and the
company won’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: How would you like to get a ticket next week?
Haven’t you any romance in you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sure I have, but I got rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Liver pills! Who wants to see liver pills on
their honeymoon? What? They want romantic places, beautiful places…
places George wants to go.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Hey, Bert, here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Come on, we got to get this up. He’s
coming.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: The groom, idiot. Come on, get that
ladder.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What are they � ducks?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Get that ladder up here.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: All right � all right.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hurry up… hurry up… hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m hurrying.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Hiya… Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Entray, monsieur, entray.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I’ll be… Mary, Mary, where did
you…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, Mary…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Remember the night we broke the windows in
this old house? This is what I wished for.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Darling, you’re wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Martini, you rented a new house?</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Rent? You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I
own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter’s Field.
Hurry, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come on… Bring the baby. I’ll bring the kids
in the car.</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, kids � here � get in here. Now
get right up on the seat there. Get the… get the goat!</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Goodbye, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All in…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home. The
Martinis cross themselves.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That old George… he’s always making a speech.
Hee-haw!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sam Wainwright!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, who cares. Bread! That this house may
never know hunger.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Salt! That life may always have flavor.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And wine! That joy and prosperity may reign
forever. Enter the Martini castle!</p>
<p><strong>reineman</strong>: Look, Mr. Potter, it’s no skin off my
nose. I’m just your little rent collector. But you can’t laugh off this
Bailey Park any more. Look at it.</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Congressman Blatz is here to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Oh, tell the congressman to wait. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>reineman</strong>: Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses
stuck here and there. There’s the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups,
daisies. Used to hunt rabbits there myself. Look at it today. Dozens of
the prettiest little homes you ever saw. Ninety per cent owned by
suckers who used to pay rent to you. Your Potter’s Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that. And are the local yokels making
with those David and Goliath wisecracks!</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Oh, they are, are they? Even though they
know the Baileys haven’t made a dime out of it.</p>
<p><strong>reineman</strong>: You know very well why. The Baileys were
all chumps. Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the
Building and Loan to build. If I were you, Mr. Potter…</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Well, you are not me.</p>
<p><strong>reineman</strong>: As I say, it’s no skin off my nose. But
one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George
Bailey for a job.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck
long enough.</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Come in here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We just stopped in town to take a look at the
new factory, and then we’re going to drive on down to Florida.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why don’t you have your friends join us?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why, sure. Hey, why don’t you kids drive down
with us, huh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I’m afraid I couldn’t get away, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he
turned me down cold.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, now, don’t rub it in.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better
run along.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Goodbye, George.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So long, George. See you in the funny
papers.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Goodbye, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks for dropping around.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: To Florida! Hee-haw!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hee-haw.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar,
Mr. Potter.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: You like it? I’ll send you a box.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I… I suppose I’ll find out sooner or
later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: George, now that’s just what I like so much
about you. George, I’m an old man, and most people hate me. But I don’t
like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I
do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey
Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I’ve been
trying to get control of it… or kill it. But I haven’t been able to do
it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and
as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Take
during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that
kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, and I saved all the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: The envious ones say that, George, the
suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let’s look at
your side. Young man, twenty- seven, twenty-eight… married, making, say…
forty a week.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Forty-five!</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after
supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you’re able to keep, say,
ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won’t even be
able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a
common, ordinary yokel, I’d say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is
not a common, ordinary yokel. He’s an intelligent, smart, ambitious
young man � who hates his job � who hates the Building and Loan almost
as much as I do. A young man who’s been dying to get out on his own ever
since he was born. A young man… the smartest one of the crowd, mind you,
a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because
he’s trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing
nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters. Do I paint a correct picture, or do
I exaggerate?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now what’s your point, Mr. Potter?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: My point? My point is, I want to hire
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hire me?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: I want you to manage my affairs, run my
properties. George, I’ll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a
year.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Twenty thou… twenty thousand dollars a
year?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: You wouldn’t mind living in the nicest house
in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business
trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn’t
mind that, would you, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Would I? You’re not talking to somebody else
around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George
Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just
come in � providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, what about the Building and Loan?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of
success? I’m offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand
dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, Mr. Potter, I… I… I know I ought to
jump at the chance, but I… I just… I wonder if it would be possible for
you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk
about it to your wife.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’d like to do that.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: In the meantime, I’ll draw up the
papers.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Okay, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No… no… no… no, now wait a minute, here! I
don’t have to talk to anybody! I know right now, and the answer is no!
NO! Doggone it! You sit around here and you spin your little webs and
you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it
doesn’t, Mr. Potter! In the… in the whole vast configuration of things,
I’d say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider. You…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …And that goes for you too!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And it goes for you too!</p>
<p><strong>potter’s voice</strong>: You wouldn’t mind living in the
nicest house in town. Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to
New York on a business trip a couple of times a year. Maybe to Europe
once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>george’s voice</strong>: I know what I’m going to do tomorrow
and the next day and next year and the year after that. I’m shaking the
dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I’m going to see the
world… And I’m going to build things. I’m going to build air fields. I’m
going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I’m going to build a
bridge a mile long.</p>
<p><strong>george’s voice</strong>: What is it you want, Mary? You want
the moon? If you do, just say the word; I’ll throw a lasso around it and
pull it down for you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Buffalo Gals, won’t you come out tonight,
won’t you come out tonight, won’t you come out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever
marry a guy like me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: To keep from being an old maid.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You could have married Sam Wainwright or
anybody else in town.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I didn’t want to marry anybody else in town. I
want my baby to look like you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You didn’t even have a honeymoon. I promised
you… …Your what?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My baby.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You mean… Mary, you on the nest?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George Bailey lassos stork.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lassos the stork! You mean you… What is it,
a boy or a girl?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Now, you’ve probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Mary had her baby, a boy.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Then she had another one � a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Day after day she worked away
remaking the old Granville house into a home.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Night after night George came back
late from the office. Potter was bearing down hard.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Then came a war.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined the
Red Cross and sewed.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Mary had two more babies, but still
found time to run the U.S.O.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Sam Wainwright made a fortune in
plastic hoods for planes.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Potter became head of the draft
board.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: One-A… One-A… One-A…</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Gower and Uncle Billy sold war
bonds.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Bert the cop was wounded in North
Africa. Got the Silver Star.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Ernie, the taxi driver, parachuted
into France.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Marty helped capture the Remagen
Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Harry… Harry Bailey topped them all.
A Navy flier, he shot down fifteen planes.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: …two of them as they were about to
crash into a transport full of soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>clarence’s voice</strong>: Yes, but George…</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: George? Four-F on account of his
ear, George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hold on… hold on… hold on now. Don’t you
know there’s a war on?</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Air raid Warden…</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: …paper drives…</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: …Scrap drives…</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: …Rubber drives…</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Like everybody else, on V-E Day he
wept and prayed.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: On V-J Day he wept and prayed
again.</p>
<p><strong>franklin’s voice</strong>: Joseph, now show him what happened
today.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>joseph’s voice</strong>: This morning, day before Christmas,
about ten A.M. Bedford Falls time…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi, Ernie, look at that.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Gonna snow again.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean � it’s gonna snow again?
Look at the headlines.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: I know � I know � I know. I think it’s
marvelous.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Commander Harry Bailey. Mr. Gower, look at
this � the second page. Now look, this is for you. This is for you, this
is for you. See you again.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Be sure you spell the name right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Extra! Extra! Read all about it!</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: George! George! It’s Harry now on
long distance from Washington!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Harry! What do you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: He reversed the charges. It’s okay,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean it’s okay? For a hero?
Harry! Oh, you old seven kinds of a son of a gun. Congratulations! How’s
Mother standing it?… She did? What do you know… Mother had lunch with
the President’s wife!</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Wait till Martha hears about this.</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: What did they have to eat?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What did they have to eat? Harry, you should
see what they’re cooking up in the town for you… Oh, are they? The
Navy’s going to fly Mother home this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: In a plane?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What? Uncle Billy? Has Uncle Billy come in
yet?</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: No, he stopped at the bank first.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s not here right now, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But look…</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …now tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: …George, that man’s here again.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What man?</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: Bank… bank examiner.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh… Talk to Eustace a minute, will you. I’ll
be right back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Carter � bank examiner.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’re all excited around here. My brother
just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated
him.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I
trust you had a good year.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good year? Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we’re broke.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah, very funny.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well… …now, come right in here,
Mr. Carter.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Although I shouldn’t wonder when you okay
reverse charges on personal long distance calls.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: George, shall we hang up?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, no. He wants to talk to Uncle Billy. You
just hold on.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Now, if you’ll cooperate, I’d like to finish
with you by tonight. I want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my
family.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t blame you at all, Mr. Carter, Just
step right in here. We’ll fix you up.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: December twenty-fourth…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Eight thousand…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Well, good morning, Mr. Potter. What’s
the news?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Well, well, well, Harry Bailey wins
Congressional Medal. That couldn’t be one of the Bailey boys? You just
can’t keep those Baileys down, now, can you, Mr. Potter?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: How does slacker George feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Very jealous, very jealous. He only
lost three buttons off his vest. Of course, slacker George would have
gotten two of those medals if he had gone.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Bad ear.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: After all, Potter, some people like
George had to stay home. Not every heel was in Germany and Japan!</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Uncle Billy and bank teller at the
window.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Good morning, Horace.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I guess you forgot something.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: You forgot something.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Well, aren’t you going to make a
deposit?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Sure, sure I am.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Well, then… it’s usually customary to bring
the money with you.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Oh, shucks…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I know I had…</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: How about that one there?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Hmm? Well, I…</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Bailey…</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Take me back there. Hurry up. Come on, look
sharp.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Take me back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter. I’ll
get those books for you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, hello, Vi.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: George, can I see you for a second?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why, of course you can. Come on in the
office here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. He’s on the
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry. Long
distance, Washington.</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: Hey, here’s Harry on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Harry, your nephew, remember?</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: Here he is.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Hello… hello… Yes, Harry � yes…
everything… everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I should have my head examined. Eight
thousand dollars. It’s got to be somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Character? If I had any character, I’d…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It takes a lot of character to leave your
home town and start all over again. He pulls some money from his pocket,
and offers it to her.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: No, George, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here, now, you’re broke, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I know, but…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you want to do, hock your furs, and
that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and
rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Yeah � sure…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s a loan. That’s my business. Building
and Loan. Besides, you’ll get a job. Good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: I’m glad I know you, George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Say hello to New York for me.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Yeah � yeah… sure I will.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now, let’s hear from you…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the matter? Merry Christmas, Vi.</p>
<p><strong>violet</strong>: Merry Christmas, George.</p>
<p><strong>mr. carter</strong>: Mr. Bailey…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, Mr. Carter, I’m sorry. I’ll be right
with you. Uncle Billy in?</p>
<p><strong>cousin tilly</strong>: Yeah, he’s in his office.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Unc… What’s going on? The bank examiner’s
here, and I…</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: He’s here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, yeah. He wants the accounts
payable…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eustace…</p>
<p><strong>eustace</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come here a minute.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last
night?</p>
<p><strong>cousin eustace</strong>: He had it on his desk counting it
before he closed up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now look, did you buy anything?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right. All right. Now we’ll go over
every step you took since you left the house.</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And did you put the envelope in your
pocket?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Yeah… yeah… maybe… maybe…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Maybe � maybe! I don’t want any maybe. Uncle
Billy, we’ve got to find that money!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I’m no good to you, George. I…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Listen to me. Do you have any secret hiding
place here in the house? Someplace you could have put it? Someplace to
hide the money?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I’ve been over the whole house, even in
rooms that have been locked ever since I lost Laura.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Listen to me! Listen to me! Think!
Think!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: I can’t think any more, George. I can’t
think any more. It hurts…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s that money, you stupid, silly old
fool? Where’s the money? Do you realize what this means? It means
bankruptcy and scandal, and prison!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s what it means! One of us is going to
jail! Well, it’s not going to be me!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello darling.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Hello Daddy, hello daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>mary and children</strong>: Bless you!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Did you bring the wreath?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Did you bring the Christmas wreath?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What? What wreath?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. I left it at the office.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is it snowing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, just started.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where’s your coat and hat?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Left them at the office.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nothing’s the matter. Everything’s all
right.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Go on, Pete, you’re a big boy. You can put the
star up. Way up at the top. That’s it. Fill in that little bare spot
right there. That’s it. Isn’t it wonderful about Harry? We’re famous,
George. I’ll bet I had fifty calls today about the parade, the banquet.
Your mother’s so excited, she…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Must she keep playing that?</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: I have to practice for the party tonight,
Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Mommy says we can stay up till midnight and
sing Christmas carols.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can you sing, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Better hurry and shave. The families will be
here soon.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Families! I don’t want the families over
here!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Come on out in the kitchen with me while I
finish dinner.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Excuse me… excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Have a hectic day?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, yeah, another big red letter day for the
Baileys.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Daddy, the Browns next door have a new car.
You should see it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, what’s the matter with our car? Isn’t
it good enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yes, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Excuse me, excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Excuse you for what?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I burped!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right, darling, you’re excused. Now go
upstairs and see what little Zuzu wants.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Zuzu! What’s the matter with Zuzu?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, she’s got a cold. She’s in bed. Caught it
coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she
didn’t want to crush it so she didn’t button up her coat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is it, a sore throat or what?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Just a cold. The doctor says it’s nothing
serious.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The doctor? Was the doctor here?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, I called him right away. He says it’s
nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is she running a temperature? What is
it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Just a teensie one � ninety-nine, six. She’ll
be all right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Gosh, it’s this old house. I don’t know why
we don’t all have pneumonia. This drafty old barn! Might as well be
living in a refrigerator. Why did we have to live here in the first
place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wrong? Everything’s wrong! You call this a
happy family? Why did we have to have all these kids?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Dad, how do you spell “frankincense”?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. Ask your mother.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Going up to see Zuzu.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He told me to write a play for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Hi, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: I won a flower.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wait now. Where do you think you’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Want to give my flower a drink.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the
flower. I’ll give it a drink.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Look, Daddy… paste it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, all right. Now, I’ll paste this
together.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There it is, good as new.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: Give the flower a drink.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now, will you do something for me?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Will you try to get some sleep?</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: I’m not sleepy. I want to look at my
flower.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know � I know, but you just go to sleep,
and then you can dream about it, and it’ll be a whole garden.</p>
<p><strong>zuzu</strong>: It will?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>janie and pete</strong>: Telephone.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll get it. Hello. Yes, this is
Mrs. Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I’m sure she’ll be
all right. The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to
have her Christmas dinner.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is that Zuzu’s teacher?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Let me speak to her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch? This is George
Bailey. I’m Zuzu’s father. Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway?
What do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked? Do you realize
she’ll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for �
to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our
kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren’t the
best-dressed kids; maybe they don’t have any decent clothes…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Aw, that stupid…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize… hello…
hello… She’s hung up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll hang her up!</p>
<p><strong>mr. welch’s voice</strong>: Now, who do you think you
are?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wait a minute. Hello? Who is this? Oh,
Mr. Welch? Okay, that’s fine, Mr. Welch. Gives me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Will you get out and let me handle this?
Hello? Hello? What? Oh, you will, huh? Okay, Mr. Welch, any time you
think you’re man enough… Hello? Any…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Daddy, how do you spell “Hallelujah”?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How should I know? What do you think I am, a
dictionary?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tommy, stop that! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Janie, haven’t you learned that silly tune
yet? You’ve played it over and over again. Now stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m sorry, Mary, Janie. I’m sorry. I didn’t
mean… you go on and practice. Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I’m
sorry. What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Nothing, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the matter with everybody? Janie, go
on. I told you to practice. Now, go on, play!</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: Oh, Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: George, why must you torture the children? Why
don’t you…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Bedford, two-four-seven, please.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Is Daddy in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: Shall I pray for him?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, Janie, pray very hard.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Me, too?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You too, Tommy. Hello, Uncle Billy?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help.
Through some sort of an accident my company’s short in their accounts.
The bank examiner’s up there today. I’ve got to raise eight thousand
dollars immediately.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Oh, so that’s what the reporters wanted to
talk to you about?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The reporters?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Yes. They called me up from your Building
and Loan. Oh, there’s a man over there from the D.A.’s office, too. He’s
looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won’t
you please? Can’t you see what it means to my family? I’ll pay you any
sort of a bonus on the loan… any interest. If you still want the
Building and Loan, why I…</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: George, could it possibly be there’s a
slight discrepancy in the books?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, sir. There’s nothing wrong with the
books. I’ve just misplaced eight thousand dollars. I can’t find it
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: You misplaced eight thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Have you notified the police?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, sir. I didn’t want the publicity.
Harry’s homecoming tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: They’re going to believe that one. What’ve
you been doing, George? Playing the market with the company’s money?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, sir. No, sir. I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: What is it � a woman, then? You know, it’s
all over town that you’ve been giving money to Violet Bick.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Not that it makes any difference to me, but
why did you come to me? Why don’t you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him
for the money?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I can’t get hold of him. He’s in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Well, what about all your other friends?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They don’t have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that. You’re the only one in town that can help
me.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: I see. I’ve suddenly become quite important.
What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any
kind?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I have some life insurance, a fifteen
thousand dollar policy.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Yes… how much is your equity in it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Look at you. You used to be so cocky! You
were going to go out and conquer the world! You once called me a warped,
frustrated old man. What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A
miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and
begging for help. No securities � no stocks � no bonds � nothing but a
miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy.
You’re worth more dead than alive. Why don’t you go to the riff-raff you
love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar? You
know why? Because they’d run you out of town on a rail… But I’ll tell
you what I’m going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is
still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, I’m going to
swear out a warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds �
manipulation � malfeasance…</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: All right, George, go ahead. You can’t hide
in a little town like this.</p>
<p><strong>potter</strong>: Bill? This is Potter.</p>
<p><strong>martini’s voice</strong>: Merry Christmas. Glad you came.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: How about some of that good
spaghetti?</p>
<p><strong>martini’s voice</strong>: We got everything.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: God… God… Dear Father in Heaven, I’m not a
praying man, but if you’re up there and you can hear me, show me the
way. I’m at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you all right, George? Want someone to
take you home?</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Why you drink so much, my friend? Please go
home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Bailey? Which Bailey?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is Mr. George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And the next time you talk to my wife like that
you’ll get worse. She cried for an hour. It isn’t enough she slaves
teaching your stupid kids how to read and write, and you have to bawl
her out…</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: You get out of here, Mr. Welch!</p>
<p><strong>welch</strong>: Now wait… I want to pay for my drink.</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Never mind the money. You get out of here
quick.</p>
<p><strong>welch</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: You hit my best friend. Get out!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You all right, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: He’s gone. Don’t worry. His name is Welch.
He don’t come in to my place no more.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh � Welch. That’s what I get for
praying.</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: The last time he come in here. You hear
that, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes, you bet.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s my insurance policy? Oh, here…</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Oh, no, Please, don’t go out this way,
Mr. Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Oh, no � you don’t feel so good.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>martini</strong>: Please don’t go away � please!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Now look what you did. My greatgrandfather
planted this tree.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Hey, you… Hey, you! Come back here, you
drunken fool! Get this car out of here!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, what’s the matter with you? Look where
you’re going!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Help! Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I didn’t have time to get some stylish
underwear. My wife gave me this on my last birthday. I passed away in
it.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, Tom Sawyer’s drying out, too. You
should read the new book Mark Twain’s writing now.</p>
<p><strong>tollkeeper</strong>: How’d you happen to fall in?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I didn’t fall in. I jumped in to save
George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You what? To save me?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Well, I did, didn’t I? You didn’t go
through with it, did you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Go through with what?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Suicide.</p>
<p><strong>tollkeeper</strong>: It’s against the law to commit suicide
around here.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yeah, it’s against the law where I come
from, too.</p>
<p><strong>tollkeeper</strong>: Where do you come from?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Heaven. I had to act quickly; that’s why I
jumped in. I knew if I were drowning you’d try to save me. And you see,
you did, and that’s how I saved you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Your lip’s bleeding, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a
prayer a little bit ago.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, no � no � no. I’m the answer to your
prayer. That’s why I was sent down here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, I know all about you. I’ve watched you
grow up from a little boy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What are you, a mind reader or
something?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, who are you, then?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Odbody… A-S-2. What’s that A-S-2?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Angel, Second Class.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Cheerio, my good man.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini put in
those drinks?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, what’s with you? What did you say just
a minute ago? Why’d you want to save me?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: That’s what I was sent down for. I’m your
guardian angel.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I wouldn’t be a bit surprised.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Ridiculous of you to think of killing
yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah… just things like that. Now how’d you
know that?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I told you � I’m your guardian angel. I
know everything about you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, you look about like the kind of an
angel I’d get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren’t you? What happened to your
wings?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I haven’t won my wings yet. That’s why I’m
an angel Second Class.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know whether I like it very much
being seen around with an angel without any wings.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, I’ve got to earn them, and you’ll help
me, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure, sure. How?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: By letting me help you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Only one way you can help me. You don’t
happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, no, no. We don’t use money in
Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, that’s right, I keep forgetting. Comes
in pretty handy down here, bub.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, tut, tut, tut.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I found it out a little late. I’m worth more
dead than alive.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Now look, you mustn’t talk like that. I
won’t get my wings with that attitude. You just don’t know all that
you’ve done. If it hadn’t been for you…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, if it hadn’t been for me, everybody’d
be a lot better off. My wife, and my kids and my friends. Look, little
fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No, you don’t understand. I’ve got my
job…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Aw, shut up, will you.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Hmmm, this isn’t going to be so easy. So
you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I guess you’re right. I
suppose it would have been better if I’d never been born at all.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I said I wish I’d never been born.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, you mustn’t say things like that. You…
…wait a minute. Wait a minute. That’s an idea. What do you think? Yeah,
that’ll do it. All right. You’ve got your wish. You’ve never been
born.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You don’t have to make all that fuss about
it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You’ve never been born. You don’t exist.
You haven’t a care in the world.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No worries � no obligations � no eight
thousand dollars to get � no Potter looking for you with the
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Say something else in that ear.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Sure. You can hear out of it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, that’s the doggonedest thing… I
haven’t heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been
that jump in the cold water.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Your lip’s stopped bleeding, too,
George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you know about that… What’s
happened?</p>
<p><strong>medium close shot</strong>: George looks around, as though to
get his bearings.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s stopped snowing out, hasn’t it? What’s
happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Our clothes are dry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you know about that? Stove’s hotter
than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we’ll stroll up
to my car and get…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll stroll. You fly.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I can’t fly. I haven’t got any wings.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You haven’t got your wings. Yeah, that’s
right.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, this is where I left my car and it
isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You have no car.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I
guess somebody moved it.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, say… Hey… where’s my car?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My car, my car. I’m the fellow that owns the
car that ran into your tree.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: What tree?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean, what tree? This tree.
Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it here.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: You must mean two other trees. You had me
worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford
Falls.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I mean Pottersville. Don’t you think I know
where I live? What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Either I’m off my nut, or
he is… …or you are!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: It isn’t me!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini’s.
Well, come on, Gabriel.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Clarence! Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s all right. Go on in. Martini’s a good
friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s a place to sit down. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>medium closeup</strong>: Nick is wiping off the bar as they
sit down.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where’s Martini?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You want a martini?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look, I’m the boss. You want a drink or don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay � all right. Double bourbon, quick,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I was just thinking… It’s been so long
since I…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look, mister, I’m standing here waiting for
you to make up your mind.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: That’s a good man. I was just thinking of
a flaming rum punch. No, it’s not cold enough for that. Not nearly cold
enough… Wait a minute… wait a minute… I got it. Mulled wine, heavy on
the cinnamon and light on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, and be
lively!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks in here
for men who want to get drunk fast. And we don’t need any characters
around to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear? Or do I have to slip
you my left for a convincer?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nick � Nick, just give him the same as mine.
He’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the matter with him. I never saw Nick
act like that before.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You’ll see a lot of strange things from
now on.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow � you worry me.
You got someplace to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You don’t huh? Well, you got any money?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No wonder you jumped in the river.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I jumped in the river to save you so I
could get my wings.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh-oh. Somebody’s just made it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Made what?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel’s just got his wings.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, I think maybe you better not mention
getting your wings around here.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Why? Don’t they believe in angels?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A… Yeah, but… you know…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Then why should they be surprised when
they see one?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He never grew up. He’s… How old are you,
anyway, Clarence?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Two hundred and ninety-three… …next
May.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That does it! Out you two pixies go, through
the door or out the window!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, Nick. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And that’s another thing. Where do you come
off calling me Nick?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, Nick, that’s your name, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s that got to do with it? I don’t know
you from Adam’s off ox. Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Didn’t I tell you never to come panhandling
around here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey!
Don’t you know me?</p>
<p><strong>gower</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Throw him out. Throw him out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, what is… Hey, Nick, Nick… Isn’t that
Mr. Gower, the druggist?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You know, that’s another reason for me not to
like you. That rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid.
If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself. Would you show these
gentlemen to the door.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Sure. This way, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey! Get me! I’m giving out wings!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You see, George, you were not there to
stop Gower from putting that poison into the…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean, I wasn’t there? I remember
distinctly…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the… hey, what’s going on around here?
Why, this ought to be Martini’s place.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I told you, George. I’m your guardian
angel.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What
else are you? What… are you a hypnotist?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well then, why am I seeing all these strange
things?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Don’t you understand, George? It’s because
you were not born.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Then if I wasn’t born, who am I?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You’re nobody. You have no identity.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean, no identity? My name’s
George Bailey.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: There is no George Bailey. You have no
papers, no cards, no driver’s license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy…
George looks in his watch pocket.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: They’re not there, either.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Zuzu’s petals.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You’ve been given a great gift, George. A
chance to see what the world would be like without you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute here.
As, this is some sort of a funny dream I’m having here. So long, mister,
I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Home? What home?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now shut up! Cut it out! You’re… you’re…
you’re crazy! That’s what I think… you’re screwy, and you’re driving me
crazy, too! I’m seeing things. I’m going home and see my wife and
family. Do you understand that? And I’m going home alone!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: How’m I doing, Joseph. Thanks. No, I
didn’t have a drink!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey… hey. Where did the Building and Loan
move to?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: The Building and what?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up
there.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: They went out of business years ago.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, Violet! Hey, listen � that’s Violet
Bick!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know that girl!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, Ernie � Ernie!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ernie, take me home. I’m off my nut!</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don’t you start
pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now
hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah � yeah � hurry up. Zuzu’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: All right. He pulls down the flag on the
meter and starts the cab.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here.
I’ve got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me now. Now, you are
Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid? That’s
right, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: You seen my wife?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Seen your wife? I’ve been to your house a
hundred times.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Look, bud, what’s the idea? I live in a shack
in Potter’s Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid…
And I ain’t never seen you before in my life.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Is this the place?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Of course it’s the place.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Well, this house ain’t been lived in for
twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: What’s up, Ernie?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: I don’t know, but we better keep an eye on
this guy. He’s bats.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! Where
are you?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: They’re not here, George. You have no
children.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where are you? What have you done with
them?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: All right, put up your hands. No fast moves.
Come on out here, both of you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bert! Thank heaven you’re here!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bert, what’s happened to this house? Where’s
Mary? Where’s my kids?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Watch him, Bert.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bert � Ernie! What’s the matter with you two
guys? You were here on my wedding night. You, both of you, stood out
here on the porch and sung to us, don’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Think I’d better be going.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Look, now why don’t you be a good kid and
we’ll take you in to a doctor. Everything’s going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take
me over to my mother’s house? Bert, listen! It’s that fellow there � he
says he’s an angel � he’s tried to hypnotize me.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I hate to do this, fella.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Run… George! Run, George!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Help! Joseph, help!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Where’d he go? Where’d he go? I had him right
here.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Well, which way’d they go? Help me find
’em.</p>
<p><strong>ma bailey</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mother…</p>
<p><strong>ma bailey</strong>: Mother? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mother, this is George. I thought sure you’d
remember me.</p>
<p><strong>ma bailey</strong>: George who? If you’re looking for a room
there’s no vacancy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.
Something terrible’s happened to me. I don’t know what it is.
Something’s happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here
until I get over it.</p>
<p><strong>ma bailey</strong>: Get over what? I don’t take in strangers
unless they’re sent here by somebody I know.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I know everybody you know. Your
brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.</p>
<p><strong>ma bailey</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, sure I do.</p>
<p><strong>ma bailey</strong>: When’d you see him last?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Today, over at the house.</p>
<p><strong>ma bailey</strong>: That’s a lie. He’s been in the insane
asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that’s where
you belong.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Strange, isn’t it? Each man’s life touches
so many other lives, and when he isn’t around he leaves an awful hole,
doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve heard of things like this. You’ve got
me in some kind of a spell, or something. Well, I’m going to get out of
it. I’ll get out of it. I know how, too. I… the last man I talked to
before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You know where he lives?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure I know where he lives. He lives in
Bailey Park.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Are you sure this is Bailey Park?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, I’m not sure of anything anymore. All I
know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You weren’t here to build them.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke through
the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s a lie! Harry Bailey went to war! He
got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on
that transport.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Every man on that transport died. Harry
wasn’t there to save them because you weren’t there to save Harry. You
see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don’t you see what a
mistake it would be to throw it away?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Clarence…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yes, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s Mary?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Oh, well, I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know how you know these things, but
tell me � where is she?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If you know where she is, tell me where my
wife is.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I’m not supposed to tell.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You’re not going to like it, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: She’s an old maid. She never married.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where’s Mary? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: She’s…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: She’s just about to close up the
library!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: There must be some easier way for me to
get my wings.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary! Mary!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary, it’s George! Don’t you know me? What’s
happened to us?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know you! Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary, please! Oh, don’t do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me. Where’s our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me,
Mary!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary… Let me go! Mary, don’t run away!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Somebody call the police!</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: Hit him with a bottle!</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: He needs a strait jacket!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That man � stop him!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tom! Ed! Charlie! That’s my wife!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh, no you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Oh, it’s you!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Stand back!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence. Get
me back. Get me back. I don’t care what happens to me. Only get me back
to my wife and kids. Help me, Clarence, please! Please! I want to live
again!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I want to live again. I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hey, George! George! You all right?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Hey, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Now get out of here, Bert, or I’ll hit you
again! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Don’t… George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bert, do you know me?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Know you? Are you kiddin’? I’ve been looking
all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe… Hey, your mouth’s bleeding; are you
sure you’re all right?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What did…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My mouth’s bleeding, Bert! My mouth’s bleed…
Zuzu’s petals! Zuzu’s… they’re… they’re here, Bert! What do you know
about that? Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>long shot</strong>: George runs away from camera yelling</p>

now, George, it’s a miracle! It’s a miracle!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In here!</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Isn’t it wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>uncle billy</strong>: Mary did it, George! Mary did it! She
told a few people you were in trouble and they scattered all over town
collecting money. They didn’t ask any questions � just said: “If George
is in trouble � count on me.” You never saw anything like it.</p>

<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Just a minute. Quiet, everybody. Quiet �
quiet. Now, this is from London. Mr. Gower cables you need cash. Stop.
My office instructed to advance you up to twenty-five thousand dollars.
Stop. Heehaw and Merry Christmas. Sam Wainwright.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Martini. How about some wine?</p>
