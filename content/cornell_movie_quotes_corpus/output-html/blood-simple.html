<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: The world is full of complainers. But
the fact is, nothing comes with a guarantee. I don’t care if you’re the
Pope of Rome, President of the United States, or even Man of the
Year–something can always go wrong. And go ahead, complain, tell your
problems to your neighbor, ask for help–watch him fly. Now in Russia,
they got it mapped out so that everyone pulls for everyone else– that’s
the theory, anyway. But what I know about is Texas…</p>
<p><strong>voice-over</strong>: And down here… you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for
out first anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Figured I’d better leave before I used it on
him. I don’t know how you can stand him.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, I’m only an employee, I ain’t married to
him.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …I don’t know. Sometimes I think there’s
something wrong with him. Like maybe he’s sick? Mentally?… Or is it
maybe me, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Listen, I ain’t a marriage counselor. I don’t
know what goes on, I don’t wanna know… But I like you. I always liked
you…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …What’re you gonna do in Houston?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’ll figure something out… How come you
offered to drive me in this mess?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I told you. I like you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: See, I never knew that.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well now you do.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Hell.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Stop the car, Ray!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …Abby?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …You know that car?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I don’t know… I just think maybe I’m making a
mistake…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …What was that back there?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Back where?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sign.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I don’t know. Motel… Abby–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before,
or were you just being a gentleman?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Abby, I like you, but it’s no point starting
anything now.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I mean, I ain’t a marriage counselor–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Hello.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Having a good time?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …What? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t know, who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …You still there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, I’m still here.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Your husband.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I know a place you can get that framed.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What did you take these for?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: What do you mean…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …Just doin’ my job.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You called me, I knew they were there, so
what do I need these for?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Well, I don’t know… Call it a fringe
benefit.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How long did you watch her?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Most of the night…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …They’d just rest a few minutes and then get
started again. Quite something.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You know in Greece they cut off the head of
the messenger who brought bad news.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Now that don’t make much sense.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No. It just made them feel better.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Well first off, Julian, I don’t know what
the story is in Greece but in this state we got very definite laws about
that…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …Second place I ain’t a messenger, I’m a
private investigator. And third place–and most important–it ain’t such
bad news. I mean you thought he was a colored. …You’re always assumin’
the worst…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, don’t come by here any more. If I need
you again I know which rock to turn over.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: That’s good… “which rock to turn over”…
that’s very good…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Well, gimme a call whenever you wanna cut
off my head…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …I can crawl around without it.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Hold it, hold it. What’s tonight?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: What night is it?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …Friday?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Right. Friday night is Yankee night.
Where’re you from?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Lubbock?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Right. I’m from Detroit It’s a big city up
north with tall buildings.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Where was I?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my
head here, I mean you’re the geologist, but my theory for what it’s
worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it’s the
equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT? Enough to light Las
Vegas for how long? How many years? Course, I’m no mathematician
but–</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Meurice.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Yeah, I know. Pour ’em short.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Has Ray come in yet?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: No, he’s off tonight. Where was he last
night?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: How would I know?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: I don’t know, didn’t he call?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Marty, I’d like you to meet an old friend
of mine, Debra. Debra, this is Julian Marty, the dude I’m always talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: If he does come in I’m not here… What were
you drinking, Debra?</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Remy.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You’ve got a very sophisticated palate.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Give Debra here another drink, and give me
the usual.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: …What’s a palate?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the
Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: I don’t follow baseball.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You won’t have to. I’ll explain what a palate
is.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: You won’t have to. I just wanted to see if
you knew.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: You said the usual–</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Red Label.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Right. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Pour that back.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t throw that out.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So how long have you know Meurice?</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: About ten years.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What–Waitaminute–What…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Deuce in the corner needs help.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …So what’re you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Going out with Meurice.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Tell him you have a headache.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: It’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: We don’t seem to be communicating–</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: You want to hustle me. I don’t want to be
hustled. It’s as simple as that. Now that I’ve communicated, why don’t
you leave?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I own the place.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Christ, I’m getting bored.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m not surprised, the company you’ve been
keeping the last ten years.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Jack Daniels. Don’t worry, I’m paying for
it.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: The point is we don’t serve niggers here.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Where? …I’m very careful about that.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: He thinks I’m kidding. Everybody thinks I’m
kidding; if Ray comes in I’m not home.</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Not really. What’d you say your last name
was?</p>
<p><strong>abby’s voice</strong>: Ray…?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …You get what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>abby’s voice</strong>: Yeah. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why d’you wanna leave all this?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You kidding? I don’t wanna leave all this, I
just wanna leave Marty…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Drive me to a motel?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You can stay at my place, I’ll drop you
there.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Where… where you going?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: See a guy.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Don’t go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that
ain’t a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just gotta see a guy.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Howdy stranger.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Meurice. Sorry I didn’t show last night.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Wasn’t too busy. You missed a good one,
though. This white guy walks in about one o’clock, asks if we have a
discount for alcoholics… I tell him to get lost, but Marty’s sitting
here listening and I can tell he’s thinking that maybe it ain’t such a
bad idea…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Ray, this is Debra. She’s a geologist.
That’s the theory of rocks.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is Marty here?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Not here tonight. Wasn’t here last night.
He’s especially not back in his office.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thanks Meurice.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Marty?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Well…? What?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What “what”?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t particularly want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well… if you’re not gonna fire me I might as
well quit.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Fine. Suit yourself. …Having a good time?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …I don’t like this kind of talk.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Then what’d you come here for?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You owe me for two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Nope. She’s an expensive piece of ass…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …You get a refund though, if you tell me who
else she’s been sluicing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I want that money. If you wanna tell me
something, fine–</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’re you, a fucking marriage
counselor?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’re you smiling at–I’m a funny guy,
right, I’m an asshole? No, no, that’s not what’s funny. What’s funny is
her. What’s funny is that I had you two followed because, if it isn’t
you, she’s been sleeping with someone else…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …What’s really going to be funny is when she
gives you that innocent look and says, What’re you talking about, Ray, I
haven’t done anything funny…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …But the funniest thing to me right now is
that you think she came back here for you–that’s what’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …Come on this property again and I’ll be
forced to shoot you…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …Fair notice.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …I thought you were dead. Going home?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No. I think I’ll stay right here in hell.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn’t
it Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Meurice…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …I don’t want that asshole near my money. I
don’t even want him in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: We get a lot of assholes in here,
Marty.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Marty?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: On the phone. Was it for you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I don’t know, he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You got a girl–am I screwing something up by
being here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, am I?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …I can find a place tomorrow, then I’ll be
outta your hair.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If that’s what you want to do, then you oughta
do it. You, uh… you want the bed or the couch?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well… the couch would be all right…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You can sleep on the bed if you want.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well… I’m not gonna put you out of your
bed…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You wouldn’t be putting me out.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Well, I’d be okay in here–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Opal–</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Lover-boy oughta lock his door…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …Lotta nuts out there.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Let’s do it outside…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …in nature.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Like to have seen his face when he found the
dead end.</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Hey mister, how’d you break your
pussyfinger?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Sorry sweetheart, my date is here…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …She saw me rolling a cigarette and thought
it was marijuana. I guess she thought I was a swinger.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Idnat wild?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Stick your finger up the wrong person’s
ass?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: You know a friend of mine broke his hand a
while back. Put in a cast. Very next day he takes a fall, protects his
bad hand, falls on his good one, breaks that too. So now he’s got two
busted flippers and I say to him “Creighton, I hope your wife loves you.
’Cause for the next five weeks you cannot wipe your own goddamn
ass…”</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …That’s the test, ain’t it? Test of true
love–</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Got a job for you.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …Well, if the pay’s right and it’s legal
I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s not strictly legal.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: If the pay’s right I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s, uh… it’s in reference to that gentleman
and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Yeah? Well how irritated are you?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …Gee, I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell
me what you want me to do or is it a secret?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Listen, I’m not–this isn’t a joke here.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: You want me to kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I didn’t say that. Well?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: You’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So, uh… this wouldn’t interest you.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: I didn’t say that. All I said was you’re an
idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it’s driving you
simple.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Ten thousand dollars I’ll give you.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: I’m supposed to do a murder–two murders–and
just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean
real stupid. Now why should I trust you?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: For the money.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: The money. Yeah. That’s a right smart of
money…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …In Russia they make only fifty cents a
day.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …There’s a big–</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: I want you to go fishing.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get
yourself noticed. I’ll give you a call when it’s done… You just find a
way to cover that money.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’ll take care of the money, you just make
sure those bodies aren’t found… There’s a…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …If you want, there’s a big incinerator
behind my place…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Sweet Jesus, you are disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: –big windows, paneleen and everytheen. So
you want, like your own place? Like a Town House?</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: No one will bother you here, sweetie–</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: I show you around.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Are you sure this is… Are you sure this
apartment is vacant?… Mrs. Esteves?</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Oh yes…</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …That’s the kitchen…</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …This is the bathroom…</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …The toilet works and everytheen…</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …And here we are back in the liveen

<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …Good floors. Gas heat.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …That’s Mr. Garcia.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …I was just esplaineen to him that he
moved out of here yesterday…</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: …You look around. Don’t mind Mr. Garcia;

<p><strong>exhorter</strong>: How ’bout it, gentlemen, let’s show out
appreciation for Lorraine up there, a registered nurse from Bolton,
Texas, how ’bout it gentlemen, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Looks like the state legislature is out of
session.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: I thought this is where they met.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Listen Meurice, you’re gonna help me with a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray,
make sure nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: It won’t?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Ever occur to you, Abby, that maybe I’m
the wrong person to ask?</p>
<p><strong>exhorter</strong>: Let’s not sit on our wallets, gentlemen.
Lorraine is up there dancing her heart out, and if you let that cash
money set on your hip, you might just as well be broke…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Thanks, Meurice.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Any time. But you don’t have to worry about
a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>exhorter</strong>: And remember, gentlemen, we’re always
here, two to two, A.M. to P.M., three hundred and sixty-four days and
Christmas, God willing and the creek don’t rise…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He’s in the house.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I could’ve sworn I heard something.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Door’s locked. Nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I knew it. ’Cause we wouldn’t have heard
anything if it was him. He’s real careful. Fact is, he’s anal.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Huh?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to
me…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …“In here, Abby. In here… I’m anal.”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Well I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I couldn’t believe it either…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Me on the other hand, I got lots of
personality…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Marty always said I had too much. ’Course he
was never big on personality…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he
could calm me down some.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person
he’d ever met, so Marty fired him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …I don’t know if you can fire a psychiatrist,
exactly.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well, I didn’t see him anymore, I’ll tell you
that much.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I said, Marty, how come you’re anal and I
gotta go to the psychiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Nothing. He’s like you, he doesn’t say
much.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Except when he doesn’t say things they’re
usually nasty.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: When you don’t they’re usually nice.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …You ever get tired?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah. Is it…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Ya catch any fish?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Ya catch any fish?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …What kind of fish?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Listen, what is it? Is it done?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …Yessir, you owe me some money.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: They look good.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Want a couple?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Just the ten thousand’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Got something to show me first?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Dead, huh?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: So it would seem.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What did you…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …What did you do with the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: It’s taken care of. The less you know about
it the better.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jesus, I don’t believe it…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …I think I’m gonna be sick.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: I’ll want that picture back…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …and you did say somethin’ about some
money.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Your money, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Something I got to ask you, Marty. I’ve been
very very careful. Have you been very very careful?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Nobody knows you hired me?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t be absurd, I wasn’t about to tell
anyone…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …This is an illicit romance–we’ve got to
trust each other to be discreet…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …For richer, for poorer.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Don’t say that. Your marriages don’t work
out so hot…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …How did you cover the money?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s taken care of. The less you know about
it the better.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …I just made a call about that. It’ll look
fine.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: I must’ve gone money simple. This kind of
murder…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …it’s too damn risky.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Then you shouldn’t have done it. Can’t have
it both ways.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …Count it if you want.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Nah, I trust ya.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: Who looks stupid now.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Damn…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Marty…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s the matter, you deaf?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Marty?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Marty, ya home?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: What day is it today, Angie?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Tuesday is ladies’ night.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Tuesday night is ladies’ night. All your
drinks are free.</p>
<p><strong>evangelist</strong>: –so there were three signs, the second
of which is Famine, this famine which I have already pointed out is
devastatin’ Africa and the Indian subcontinent. And the third of these
signs is earthquakes. Now I don’t know why he threw that in but if you
talk to a geologist, and I’ve talked to many, he’ll tell you that
earthquake activity–</p>
<p><strong>evangelist</strong>: –has increased almost eighty percent in
the past two years, and what’s more, in two years’ time we’ll be
experiencin’ what’s knows as the Jupiter Effect–</p>
<p><strong>evangelist</strong>: –wherein all the planets of the known
universe will be aligned up causin’ an incredible buildup of destructive
gravitational force. Now in Matthew Chapter Six, Verse Eighteen the Lord
out and tells us that these are the signs by which we shall know that He
is at our door. There are many good people disagree with me, but it’s my
belief that this Antichrist is alive today and livin’ somewhere in
Europe, in that ten- nation alliance I spoke of, bein’ groomed for his
task–</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Abby… you all right?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ray?… What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know. It’s early… I love you.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …You all right?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know. I better get off now.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Okay, see ya… Thanks, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Abby–</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re bad.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I said you’re bad.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …You’re bad too.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’re both bad.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Why didn’t you get into bed?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I didn’t think I could sleep. I’m surprised you
could. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …You called me this morning.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …I just wanted to let you know that everything
was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep
our heads.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I know about it, Abby. I went to the bar last
night.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What happened?–Was Meurice there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …He didn’t see me, though. Nobody saw me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Is it cold in here?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well… what happened?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I cleaned it all up, but that ain’t
important…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …What’s important is what we do now; I mean we
can’t go around half- cocked. What we need is some time to think about
this, figure it out…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be
smart.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ray–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you’re
gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he’s
dead…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …because if he’s not dead he’s gonna get up and
try and kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …That’s the only thing they told us in the
service that was worth a goddamn–Where the hell’s my windbreaker?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What the hell happened, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That ain’t important. What’s important is that
we did it. That’s the only thing that matters. We both did it for each
other…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …That’s what’s important.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I… I mean what’re you talking about, Ray? I
haven’t done anything funny.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …What was that?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ray, I mean you ain’t even acting like
yourself. First you call me at five in the A.M. saying all kinds of nice
things over the telephone and then you come charging in here scaring me
half to death without even telling me what it is I’m supposed to be
scared of. I gotta tell you it’s extremely rattling.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Don’t lie to me, Abby–</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How can I be lying if I don’t even know–</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …I mean if you and him had a fight or
something, I don’t care, as long as you…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Welp, that was him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Who?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Marty.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …What’s going on with you two?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …You can call him back, whoever it was…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …I’ll get out of your way.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You left your weapon behind.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hi Meurice, this is Helene, Helene
Trend, and I’m calling ’cause I wanna know just what the hell that
remark you made about Sylvia’s supposed to mean…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: …She says you’re full of shit and
frankly I believe her. And hey, I love you too. Sure. Anyway, you better
call me soon because I’m going to South America tonight–you know,
Uruguay?</p>
<p><strong>marty’s voice</strong>: Listen asshole, you know who this is.
I just got back from Corpus and there’s a lot of money missing from the
safe…</p>
<p><strong>marty’s voice</strong>: …I’m not saying you took it but the
place was your responsibility and I told you to keep an eye on your
asshole friend. Don’t–uh, don’t come to the bar tonight, I’ve got a
meeting. But tomorrow I want to have a word with you, and with Ray–if
you can find him.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Meurice, where the hell have you
been? I–</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: I hope you’re planning on leaving town.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Got a problem, Meurice?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: No, you do, cowboy. You been to the
bar?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Why?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: You shouldn’t have taken the money…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Look at me man, I’m serious. You broke in
the bar and ripped off the safe…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Abby warned me you were gonna make
trouble. Trouble with you is, you’re too fucking obvious; the only ones
with the combination are me and you…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I’m
concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Those things are nothing but coffin
nails.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Look. Personally I don’t give a shit. I
know Marty’s a hard-on but you gotta do something. I don’t know; give
the money back, say you’re sorry, or get the fuck out of here, or
something…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …It’s very humiliating, preaching about
this shit.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: I’m not laughing at this, Ray Bob, so you
know it’s no fucking joke.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Marty?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ray…?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Lover-boy oughta lock his door.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I love you…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …That’s a stupid thing to say, right?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I… I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No. You’re just saying that because you’re
scared…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: …You left your weapon behind.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: He’ll kill you too.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ray.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …Where is everything?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: In the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …In the car.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …You leaving?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Isn’t that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Wanna come with me?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …But first I gotta know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your
money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …I don’t know, wasn’t it you? Maybe a burglar
broke in, and you found–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: With your gun?…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Nobody broke in, Abby. I’ll tell you the
truth…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Truth is, I’ve felt sick the last couple of
days. Can’t eat… Can’t sleep… When I try to I… Abby…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …The truth is… he was alive when I buried
him.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Abby. What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I… I’m sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you…
Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Yeah… yeah, come in…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …but I gotta tell ya…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …I’m retired.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No, I–</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Well I do…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …For you I answer the door. If you wanna
stay here, that’s fine. But I’m retired.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Something happened with Marty and Ray–</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Abby…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Let me ask you one question…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Why do you think I’m retired.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty.
Until both of ’em calm down I’m not getting involved.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No Meurice, it’s worse than that. Something
really happened, I think Marty’s dead–</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: What?! Did Ray tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Sort of…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: That’s total bullshit. Marty called me
after he was jacked up…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …I mean, I don’t know where he is, but he
ain’t dead.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Meurice–</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: You don’t look too good. You sleep last
night?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Meurice, you gotta help me…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: All right. Just sit tight. Try to get some
sleep…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …I’ll find Marty, find out what’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Opal?</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: Even the fucking dog’s gone crazy…</p>
<p><strong>meurice</strong>: …Something pretty fucking weird is going
on. Put your coat on and I’ll drop you at home. But don’t talk to either
of ’em until I do. And don’t worry. Believe me. These things always have
a logical explanation. Usually.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ray…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No curtains on the windows.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …So?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I think someone’s watching.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: So what’ll they see?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just leave it off. He can see in.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: –If you do anything the neighbors’ll hear.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You think…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: …Abby. I meant it… when I called…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Because you’re scared.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ray–</p>
<p><strong>old woman’s voice</strong>: Get away! I’ll call my
son-in-law!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No no–you don’t understand–</p>
<p><strong>old woman’s voice</strong>: He has a gun!</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …You got some of my personal property.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …One of you does.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …I don’t know what the hell you two thought
you were gonna pull.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: …I ain’t afraid of you, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …Well ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>visser</strong>: …If I see him, I’ll sure give him the
message.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Hey there, stranger! What can I do you
for?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I need a room.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He needs a room, Dusty.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I reckon I can hear him… …Room rate’s eight
sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How much extra?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He wants the TV option, Dusty.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that’s a
dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Tell him the channels, Dusty.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Channels, we got two and six. Two don’t come
in so hot.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just a room then.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: He don’t want the option, Dusty.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: I reckon I heard the man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Does he work here?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Sure don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: See, Wednesday’s the special on RC Cola. I
don’t know if I explained about the TV option. If there’s a TV in the
room, you got to pay the option.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: And how many room got TV, Dusty?</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Ever durned one.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay, I’ll take the TV option.</p>
<p><strong>rhodes</strong>: Well see the thing about that is, we’re
booked.</p>
