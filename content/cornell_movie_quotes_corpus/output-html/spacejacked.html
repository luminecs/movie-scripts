<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Ahh, the space age. Must have been a
thrilling time to be alive. All the hopes for a better tomorrow, all the
dreams of inhabiting new worlds…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: It’s amazing they even made it out
this far, considering what they had to work with. Guess it really was
one giant leap…a hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: But I guess after that first leap,
things just weren’t as exciting. How much do you need to know about a
place like the moon? It’s cold, silent…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: But it sure was a beautiful place to
visit, or so they said. At least if you could afford it…guess it all
boils down to money in the long run -</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Me, I just felt lucky to be along for
the ride.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: How are you this evening, Dawn Murphy?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Congratulations on your…recent award.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Is there anything I can help you with?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: No, just enjoying the view.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well, there’s no better to way to see the
world, than with us.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: So I’ve been told.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Well if you need anything, please feel free to
ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in
the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our
ship bar.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Thank you, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Enjoy your trip with us.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Hey, chief…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Hello, Delbert and Monica Miles.
Congratulations on your recent wedding -</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Yeah yeah look never mind all that, let me
get another one of these, lots of ice, and don’t be stingy with the
whiskey this time ok?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Certainly, and anything for you Monica?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Oh, and bring out some more of those little
baked things and some hot mustard.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Certainly. I will now process your request, and
I hope you’re enjoying your trip with us.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I don’t like him calling me by my name, it
gives me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Yeah, I wish he’d put a sock in it already.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: What’s wrong baby? You haven’t said a whole
lot lately…</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m homesick.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Homesick? It’s only been two days!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: We should have gone to Nassau. At least we
could go swimming, lie on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Ah hell we can always do that. Listen
believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: How is it going to be different from this?
Go see some boring footprint under glass?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Look you were the one who wanted to do
something different, something to tell all your friends. Any chump can
go to Nassau.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Look around you baby, we’re rubbing elbows
with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class. You’ll be envied by
everyone.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Besides I can’t wait to tee off on the sea
of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: You know? The guy at the club I was telling
you about?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I still say we should have gone to
Nassau.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: How’s everything looking?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Finishing up the diagnostic, everything
checks out normal, we still have to take a look at the starboard suite
on B deck. We’ve relocated her and she doesn’t seem to be that upset
about it.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Why should she, it’s her fault. All guests
are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I
guess, didn’t realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated
machinery.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Well, I guess she figures she’s paying for
it.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Ain’t it the truth. Must be good to be
rich.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: All right, I’m headed down to engineering.
If you gentlemen need me, that’s where I’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes sir. Reynolds leaves the room -</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well I guess there’s no time like the
present. I’ll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra
mile for our guests.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sounds like you’ve been talking to Mac too
much.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yeah. I think he’s developing a crush on
me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Now look will you please be careful with
those! They cost more than you make in a year.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When will my original room be ready again?</p>
<p><strong>1st porter</strong>: I’m sure they’ll notify you as soon as
they’re done ma’am. ANNA Shuffling back and forth! I feel like I’m
traveling coach!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Put them near the window! And be careful!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Evening.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re Warren Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Uh, yes I am. And you are?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand,
Warren shakes it -</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Koros, as in…Koros? Dimitri Koros?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: My grandfather. My God, I can’t tell you what
a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Magnificent, magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So, what brings you out here? Pleasure
cruise?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well a little business too. In my upcoming
project Star Trackers I play a ship’s captain, and I really wanted to
get a feel for the outer space experience. I feel it will add more
credibility to my performance.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Of course, of course…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well I guess we’re neighbors for this
trip.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well, so we are. Sure is beautiful, huh?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It certainly is.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest
of the trip.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m sure I will.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m sure we’ll see each other again.</p>
<p><strong>1st porter</strong>: You’re all set ma’am. I’ll personally go
and check on the status of the old room right now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’ll do nothing of the kind.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m staying put, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hey Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yeah go.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m getting a very strange command on the
life pod status check. Did anything come up on the last diagnostic?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: No, I just ran it! Why are you running it
again?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well it’s a good thing that I did.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s telling me fail mode confirmed. Did you
see this?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: There must be some mistake. You sure you hit
the right commands?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes I’m sure I hit the right commands.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Why don’t you reset and run it again. The
pods check out ok.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re certain of that?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Trust me. Even checked ’em with my own
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right, I’ll give it a shot.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: They said it would be ok to come up here.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m Dawn Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh right, right you’re on that research
grant.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome aboard.
First time in space?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there’s
nothing like the real thing. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: This is my second commercial flight. I used
to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: So you were looking for a new challenge.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, plus the money ain’t that bad. DAWN
So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars’ worth on
this trip of a lifetime?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, let me put it this way. Most of the
cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space
travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do
something careless.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Like open an airlock by mistake?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well I don’t think there’s a chance of that
happening. It’s usually the moon walks. Sometimes you feel like a
kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Well I hope I don’t do anything careless.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m sure you’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Actually I’ve logged about 200 hours of
simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship
construction.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Still, I hope I behave on the moon. I’ll stick
close to you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well then you’ll have nothing to worry about
at all. You’re dealing with a trained professional. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: Look at this…Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, I guess money don’t buy class.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: No. But it buys a lot of other things.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like that piece of ass he was with.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: Well…I don’t mind. I can put up with it. I’m
taking six months off after this, and I won’t have to deal with people
snapping their fingers at me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not me. I’m in for the long haul. In nine
months I’ll have enough to take a few years off.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: Well, more power to you. Me, I start to bug
out after too much time out here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t have a problem with it. Besides, you
get to meet a lot of interesting people.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: Yeah. A virtual pantheon of stars.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, it’s early yet.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: :INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: More wine sir?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Just leave the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Don’t worry I’ll take care of you at the
end of the night.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Oh no…I think there’s carrots in here…</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Send it back if you don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: She’s allergic to carrots. Is there carrots
in that?</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: Uh, I don’t believe so, no, but I can -</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Yeah go check it out. I don’t need her
turning purple on me, though it would match her dress.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I’m just kidding baby.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So… Wayne looks at her as she looks him
directly in the eye, after having had a few drinks -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What was it like doing a love scene with
Pamela Jarvis?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well, uh, I just don’t know what to say… I
guess there’s worse ways to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I did a love scene once for an interactive
instructional disc. The guy had B.O. and I told him so. Next day he wore
so much cologne I almost threw up.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Oh. Really?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Why don’t you tell them the good side?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: That’s where I met Delbert. He came down to
the set, then he wanted me on more discs, then he put me in the
magazine. Then he married me!</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Well, see? It wasn’t so bad after all.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I bet Pamela had nothing bad to say about
you.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: No, I think hygiene is important. It helps
you get into the part.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Very professional of you.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Excuse me ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention please?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Could I have your attention please?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: On behalf of myself and the crew, I’d like
to welcome you all aboard the Star Princess. I guarantee this will be a
trip you will never forget.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: In approximately 36 hours we will be
landing 300 yards from the very spot where the Apollo 12 lunar module
first set down in 1969. From there you will be able to leave the ship
and be an eyewitness to history. The actual flag, the actual first
footprint, all carefully preserved for you to view. It’s going to be a
tremendous experience, and I’m glad all of you decided to come along for
the ride.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Now many passengers want to know the nuts
and bolts of how we carry out the operation. So for all you technology
fans I’m happy to announce we have Mac on board. Mac is our mobile
automated concierge, and has been programmed to have an encyclopedic
knowledge of every detail of the ship’s operations. He’s here to make
you happy, so feel free to ask him anything.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: So once again, thanks for coming aboard,
and enjoy your stay on the star princess.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I’m horny.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Get your hands off of me! DISSOLVE TO</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, everything’s running smoother than a
baby’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Ain’t it the truth. The two say nothing for
a beat -</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So, are you on for the next one?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I don’t know. Everything’s up in the air at
this point, no pun intended.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why, didn’t they say?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well that hotel begins construction in
January, there’s going to be a lot of shuttle work.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You want to go back to shuttle work?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: It’s steady, good benefits.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You gotta think of your old age.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s very pragmatic of you, Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Man, I’m hungry. I’m going to call the
steward, you want anything?.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Nah, I already ate. Why don’t you just go
down there?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What, and leave you here all by your
lonesome?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I think I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, maybe I will. You sure you don’t want
anything?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: No. I’m all set. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, maybe I’ll surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I can hardly wait.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Mac. What’s shaking?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You are currently stationed for bridge duty at
this time.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes Mac I know that.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Jeez…hall monitor.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Nighty night, captain.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Have one on the house for me.</p>
<p><strong>hanger -</strong>: Reynolds walks over to a chair dressed in
his bathrobe - he lowers himself into the chair and takes a book off the
table -</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well…I suppose you can’t have your cake…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: …without breaking a few eggs.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Why was this door locked?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Isn’t it past your bed time, sir?</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What did you say to me?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: It’s a little late for you to be up.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Look answer my question!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What’s going on here!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: That’s mine. I was just having a little
fun.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: A little fun? Have you lost it Barnes! You
realize how sensitive this equipment is?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: All too well, captain.</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: Well shut it off at once!</p>
<p><strong>reynolds</strong>: What’s the meaning of this countdown?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I can’t tell you that…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: …it’s not on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Blastoff.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I don’t know. I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Bridge? Captain?! Hello Bridge!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Bridge! Bridge, do you copy!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Bridge! Can anyone hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: A little sloppy. But it will do.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: If anyone can hear me please respond!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: That’s very professional sounding of you,
Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: We hope you’re enjoying your trip. And we
apologize to those currently hurtling through space. Guess them’s the
breaks.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Barnes, can you hear me, are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.
You don’t have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What is the condition of the bridge?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things
down there?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us
offline. Override the airlock sensors and hurry! We’re running out of
time, we have to get to the pods!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Much as I’d like to help you and our valued
guests, I’m afraid I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What are you talking about! Can you transmit
the code 3 -</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I
just don’t think it’s a prudent move at this juncture.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Barnes have you flipped your wig?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: It’s a weave, Taylor, and you know that.
We’ve always been straight with one another.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Now do you want the good news first or the
bad news?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You better start making sense!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Ok, I will. The bad news is the ship is
history. Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Then we’ve got to get to the lifepods!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I’d advise you to shut up and let me finish
Taylor. You needn’t worry about the lifepods because they’re all gone,
jettisoned. Save for one.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: And I think we know who’s getting it. TAYLOR
Why are you doing this!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I was getting to that. Now please don’t try
my patience Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Now we’re all businessmen and a common rule
of business is to make payment for services rendered. Given that, I’m
willing to provide a service to each and every one of you. INT DINING
ROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I’m willing to transmit that code 3
emergency. If you’re lucky a rescue team might just get to you in time.
Of course by then I’ll be long gone.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: In exchange for what!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well Carlo, you’re not really part of the
equation…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: But those other high rollers around you are.
I will provide this service in return for the personal authorization
codes of each and every bank account. Once I have those codes, and I’ve
completed the transfer, I’ll signal the alarm. But not a minute
before.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: What the hell is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What part didn’t you understand, fat man?
It’s a hold up, pure and simple. I want your money. Cooperate and I’ll
let you live. And this offer is non- negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s suicide Barnes! How do you think you’re
going to get away it!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They’ll track him down in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I understand your concern, but those are my
problems, not yours. But for the record, the transfer trail will take
them years to follow. By then it won’t matter, because I won’t exist, at
least not on paper.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Why would we give you anything without a
guarantee of our safety!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well, I guess that’s just a question of
faith, huh? Of course, if money means more to you than a chance at
survival… I’d say you’re my kind of guy!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s still not going to work! They’ll detect
you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Who said I’ll re-enter in the pod? I got
friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.
Thank God for deregulation huh?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Now I think I’ve given you all the
information you need to make a sound decision. But I’d advise you to
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I’ll give you fifteen minutes to organize
your information. I’ll take any further delay as a sign you’ve rejected
the offer, and then of course, it’s rescinded.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Over and out.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: This is insane. This can’t be happening.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I think we should do what he tells us.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: How do we know he’s not bluffing?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Well maybe there’s a way out of here.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Fat chance of that. Even if we had C4 and a
laser torch these doors wouldn’t budge. That son of a bitch…that stupid
son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team
get you out if the doors won’t open?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Probably come through the wall I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Well maybe we can do something like that.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t think you know what you’re talking
about. Besides, what could we use for tools? A steak knife? A
corkscrew?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Just considering our options… sir.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: We couldn’t try anything anyhow. He must be
watching everything we do.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: If only I could override this thing.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: On the behalf of the Star Princess we apologize
for any inconvenience you might experience -</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Get outta here, will ya!!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Well now what are we gonna do!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: How am I supposed to know?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: You’re Delbert Miles! You have more clout
than some whacked out pilot! Talk to him!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Talk to him…Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I tell you one thing, I’m not giving him
shit, not a password, not an access code, not the time of day.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I think we should do what he asks.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Oh you do, huh? Well let me tell you
something lady, if you think that cracker is on the level, you’re
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: That’s a risk we can’t afford to take.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I can. Use your head, do you think he wants
anyone around to say what happened?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: There’s a chance he’ll keep his end of the
bargain, if we only cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look. We’re talking about life and death here.
I don’t know why we’re even having this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Well what would you know about it? You
don’t have anything to lose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re gonna give him those bank codes, you
know why? Because I’m telling you to, that’s why. I’m not losing my life
over some greedy pig.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Who are you calling a pig, rummy?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Come on! Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Let’s just stay calm, ok?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t believe this crap!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I am receiving a high level of negative
feedback from our guest’s comments. Many expletives at a higher than
usual decibel level.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Look, people, listen to me. As the first
mate, I know a lot about this ship. Now I don’t know what’s going on
outside these doors, I don’t know where the captain is, I don’t know
who’s left out here. What I do know is that if what he’s saying is true,
we’re in serious trouble. So I suggest we collect the information he
wants, and give it to him.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: That’s still no guarantee of anything!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We don’t have a choice! Now let’s write them
down, OK?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Supposing we could get out of this room? Is
there anything we could do to reach the bridge?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It depends on the condition of the ship. If
I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior
air locks for a possible entry.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Can’t we access the mainframe to check the
ship’s condition?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: With what? How am I going to interface with
it? I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk
to me.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: We’re screwed. Totally screwed.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: A way to talk to the system…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Carlo, get me the cable off the menu
register.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We’re going to have to be quick.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Break it down to me, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Seems like they’re cooperating. Hopefully
I’ll be out of here and on my way very soon.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well don’t drag your ass. There won’t be much
of a window for us to link up. We’ll be in your orbit trajectory in less
than two hours.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan
remember? Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it
from there.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Will do. What about the distress signal?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I don’t know. I really haven’t made up my
mind yet. We’ll see how nicely they behave.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well that’s your call. Doesn’t make a damn
bit of difference to me. Just as long as I get my cut.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Oh you’ll get it, believe me. So I’ll see
you in a few.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: 10-4 good buddy.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yeah yeah, 10-4…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Shame to waste a fine corona.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Is that all of them?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes. That’s all of them.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I can’t believe we’re doing this.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well we are, so get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Barnes. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Uh, that’s an affirmative, Roger Wilco.
Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We have the codes here. How do you want to
receive them?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well, preferably in tens and twenties…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: That was a joke Taylor, lighten up! Why
don’t you just hold them up to the lens. I’ll write them down, and once
I’m through verifying them, I’ll get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Will you transmit the distress signal?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Once I’m done verifying them. Can’t be too
trustworthy nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Here. Take this.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: OK…it’s open.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Seen one like it before?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Sure. It complies with all standard
construction codes.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at
Taylor -</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Certainly. If you need anything, please feel
free to ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes I know all that. Mac, I need you to help
us out with a little technical problem.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Certainly. I have a full working knowledge of
the ships operations.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Right, I understand that…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I need you to actually do something for me.
I need to access your CPU, directly.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That will not be necessary. You can simply
speak to me. I understand most languages fluently.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeah but the ship’s mainframe doesn’t. I
need you to tell it something.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Alteration of my central processing unit should
be done only by an authorized service dealer.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I know but we’re in a bind.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Alteration of my central processing unit should
be done only by an authorized service dealer.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it. It
will reduce the level of negative feedback.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That is one of my priorities.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That is what I thought…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Now which one was it again?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s the left one, I think.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I tell you, I should have been an actor.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Ok, the first thing we need to know is the
status of this floor.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this
deck?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: One moment please… one moment please…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Do you think it’s working?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It should. Mac?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: This corridor is accessible, and we hope you
enjoy it. I’m sorry to say we are having technical problems with…all
exits on this level. We apologize for this inconvenience.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But the corridor outside this door is open,
correct?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Yes. You can enjoy some wonderful views from
there.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Screw the damn views! Get us out of here
you piece of crap!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Mac, what about the suit compartments on
this level? Can they be accessed?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m sorry. The suit compartments are in a
non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere. I’m afraid that’s off limits to
all passengers.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Damn it. If only we could get to those
suits… Dawn then thinks of something -</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Why can’t we?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know the condition of the
compartments. Depending on damage, debris…could be a fatal mistake.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Unless you could hold your breath.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And suppose you couldn’t hold out?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Suppose you didn’t have to hold your
breath?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: We could send Mac. If he can retrieve one
suit, we could go back for the other.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Jack, let me have your walkie. Put it on
channel 10.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Open the door, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Ok Mac… I’ll talk to you on this. I want to
find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Certainly. Anything I can do to be of
service.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He certainly is polite.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Close every door behind you!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: How is it looking, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I would recommend a maintenance crew in this
sector.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Is it safe for human transport?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: That’s affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeah, let’s hope he can find a way
through.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Mac please check the status of the suit
compartment on this level I want you to go in there and get a suit.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I will manually open the door, and will report
this problem to maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I have experienced a critical error…I have
experienced a critical error…I will review my previous commands.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Mac. Mac!</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Not bad for a day’s work.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Where the hell did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to
come to the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Is there anything I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Sure. Come on in pally. Take a load off.</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: Mac. Mac can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I don’t understand. It was working fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe the walkie shorted out.</p>
<p><strong>turner</strong>: How? Mac, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: So how did you get here, Mac? I’m impressed.
MAC I had to pass through several restricted areas. I am sensing a high
level of passenger dissatisfaction, which is my duty to report.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Weren’t you down in the dining room?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I was there. Officer Taylor accessed my CPU
directly to open the airlock doors. They are not functioning
properly.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Oh he did, did he?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Yes he did. Yes he did. Barnes looks at the
monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You didn’t do anything to the monitors, did
you Mac?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I did nothing to the monitors.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: And what are they doing now, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: They are awaiting further information.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Were you going to give it to them?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I am here to provide service to… to all our
guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my
duty…to report this.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well you did the right thing Mac.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: So, you were communicating with officer
Taylor over the wrist walkie?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: On channel 10?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The device has stopped responding.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well, we’re going to have to do something
about that aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Mac, can you hear me? Come in?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Taylor, you surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Never send an android to do a man’s work.
INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Sure you do. Sending Mac out on a little
recon work. How pathetic. Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses. Or
maybe he’s just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot
Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Look we gave you what you asked for. It
checks out didn’t it?! What more do you want from us!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I told you not to try anything smart! I
guess you’re too much of a maverick to follow a simple order! And that’s
just too bad for all of you now, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Look you said it doesn’t matter to you
anyway! Why do you want to kill more innocent people! Why!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I suppose you want a diatribe about my
agenda to get even with the world, or some crap.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well it’s not that complex. I don’t give a
damn about the haves, and I don’t give a damn about the have- nots. And
I sure as hell don’t give a damn about any of you.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: It’s business. Period. If you followed
directions, you might have had a chance. But all that’s all over
now.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I’ll tell you what I will do, though. I’ll
make sure you all see the moon. Unfortunately it will have to be a one
way trip.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: So in closing I’d like to thank all of you
for your generous contributions and thanks for flying the Star Princess.
Watch your step on the way out. Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Mac, you really earned your wings this
flight.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: My…wings…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Yes, your wings.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I am here to provide service to… to all our
guests. There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my
duty…to report this.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly
I don’t know what I’d have done without you on this one.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: There is a high level…of passenger
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: And I intend to correct that at once. I’ll
tell you something Mac…</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You’re really gonna go far in this
business.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh my God, what is he doing?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: He’s shutting off the air!!!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: That lousy, stinking son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: That lousy -</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Delbert! What’s gonna happen?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Delbert!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m scared. I’m really scared!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He might still be playing a game with us.
But at this point the odds are slim, he’s already killed too many
others.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: So…what’s the next step?</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: What’s the use…we’re gonna die…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t say that! It ain’t over till it’s
over!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s a question of getting to the lifepod.
Before Barnes does. But even then, the pod has a maximum capacity of
seven adults. And there’s eight of us.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Well we’ll just cram in!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It doesn’t work that way! There’s only so
much oxygen, only so much fuel, only so much mass it can handle on
re-entry!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: If I could get to the bridge I could send
the distress signal.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Even if we do, it might be too late.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Then I have no other choice. I have to get
to the suit compartment.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought you said it was too risky.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m not letting him get away with this. It’s
our last chance.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Everyone just stay put.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I can’t let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Look I know what I’m doing. I have experience
and training in space walking.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Simulated space walking.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You might need assistance, you don’t know what
your facing.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’ll go crazy sitting here. I’d rather risk
it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right come on.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Everyone just stay calm. Everything’s going
to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Jack, keep it together in here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll do my best.</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: We’re going to die.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will you shut up already?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I’ll tell you one thing, I’m not gonna just
lie down and die for this crackpot. The hell with that!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: And what are you going to do, genius?</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I haven’t quite made up my mind yet.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll tell you what you’re gonna do. You’re
gonna stay put like Taylor said.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Again with the orders from you! You got a
Napoleon complex chief, and I’m getting sick of it!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Will you two please stop it! I don’t want to
spend my final hours listening to you bitch!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’m going to do.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I’m going to have myself a drink.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s through this door.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know what we’re facing.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Ready as I’ll ever be.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Yeah. We did it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So we did.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Now that’s what I call an emergency
exit.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re ready for the real thing?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: At this point I’m ready for anything.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: I tell you, something’s not right here. How
do we know they’re not going to use the pod for themselves?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because, Taylor wouldn’t do that, that’s
why.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: What makes you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not asking now, I’m begging. Please shut
up!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: 2059…a very good year.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: You want some? It’s got a hearty
bouquet.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Getting drunk is no solution.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Yeah, well…I forgot my morphine back in the
room.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Go on, have some. In fact…</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Have the whole thing. There’s plenty more
where that came from.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So I guess this is it.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: This is it. Finished. Kaput. Over.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: And Warren Wayne’s going out in style.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: A little sweet. CUT TO EXT STAR PRINCESS</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Be careful, you don’t want to puncture the
suit.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Don’t worry about me. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: To the other side. There’s an airlock close
to engineering. If it’s intact, I can get to the pressure vents.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Explosive?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: One of Barnes’ duds, luckily for us. Take
this out of the equation right now…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That psychotic bastard…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What do you think’s going to happen to us?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, Dawn, I’m an optimist by nature.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Yeah, but you didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Do you want some advice?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Don’t worry about what will happen, just
concentrate on what is happening. You’ll live longer.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Words to live by.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Those idiots…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Good news. Look.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s intact. We’re one step closer. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: It’s time we lock coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: So, what are we waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Cool your jets…I’m doing a little damage
control.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Damage control! What kind of damage? What’s
going on Barnes!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Don’t do anything until further notice!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The engines!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dawn! Dawn!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Helllp!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re safe. Grab my hand -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I think we’re moving.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Well isn’t that great. Something to write
home about.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I never though I’d be stuck in a wine closet
with Warren Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Well get used to it, ’cause here we are, on
the cruise of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Tell me, miss Koros, how are you enjoying
the trip so far?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Can I get you anything? Some more cheese
puffs perhaps…</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I’m perfectly serious. I’m here to satisfy
your every request here on the cruise of a lifetime. Just ask, anything
you want, anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I want you. Now.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude. You
saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It was no time to lose my partner. We’re
going to have to hurry, he’s on to us.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Oh my God. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: The room is filled with poison gas. The
hydraulic system must have blown.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That sick bastard…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: A schematic of the ship. Looking for a
lifeline to the pods.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: We don’t have enough suits to get the others
out.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s why we need a safe passage. remember
what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just
be our ticket.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No look, see that. One deck up will take you
across the damaged lower decks. There’s a bulkhead here, then over that,
one deck down, is a storage room. That room is adjacent to the dining
room. We get through that wall, we get them out to here -</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: How are we going to blow the wall?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Take this flare.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: A flare? A flare won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But this will. Just attach it to the
flare.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: The flare is self igniting, it has a short
fuse, so be careful. And remember…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: A little dab’ll do ya. Now you know how to
get there, right?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Why? Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m not going with you.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: There’s only room on that pod for seven.
That’s you and the others. I’m counting on you to get them out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: And what are you going to do?!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m going to try and buy you some time. I
can get to the bridge from here.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: But how are you going to escape?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Don’t worry about me. There’s still a chance
I can issue a distress signal.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: But you can’t be sure! It’s suicide. You have
to come with us!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Listen, Dawn. You have to stay focused.
Don’t unravel on me. Now you’ve got to get them to safety! I’m counting
on you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Don’t worry about me. I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Now hurry up. We’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Keep in touch.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I will once I get past the bulkhead. Good
luck.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: You’re not helping my heart condition any,
Barnes! Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: The others decided to get cute with me, so
I’m teaching them a lesson!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: This ship is going down in a blaze of
glory!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well blaze your ass out of there! You’ve
completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Don’t worry about me, I’m changing
coordinates now. I’ve come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley
do-right… motherfuckers!</p>
<p><strong>carlo</strong>: It’s getting hard to breathe…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just don’t move around too much.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks for taking my advice.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: It’s getting too cold in here. I can’t stand
this anymore!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Baby, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: How can you sit there with your fat stomach
and tell me to take it easy! I want to go home! I want to be warm! I
want to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Look, calm down, getting all crazy is going
to make things worse.</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: It’s ok… Just then Jack emerges from behind
them and drapes a TABLECLOTH over both their shoulders -</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Keep her warm.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh Warren…oh Warren…take me, God take me…</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Oh yeah…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh yeah…</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Oh Sara…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Anna…</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Anna…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: This must be it. Taylor come in. Can you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I know that!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well if you knew it then why did set your
thrusters on before making the calculation?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I told you, I had to teach a few people a
lesson!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my
onions!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Let’s get something straight, Chappy!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I don’t take orders from you, you take
orders from me! You got that?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Now I got enough air and supplies to make
another complete orbit in the pod! You’re just gonna have to pick me up
later.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: This is a major screw up on your part,
goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well then why don’t I tell you something,
good buddy? I don’t need to listen to shit from you! Now you want to
call it off fine, I’ll take the risk of re-entry but you’re out of the
picture, understand?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Now we’ll regroup in 24 hours, tell whoever
you need to you’re extending the trip, and pick me up accordingly. Is
that clear?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: That’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Good. Now you’ll hear from me when I have
the new coordinates. In the meantime don’t bug me.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Sheesh! Aye aye cap’n!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Over and out!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Idiot…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Good help is hard to find…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dawn. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Taylor! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m in the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He’s out of the equation. Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m about to blow the wall.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hurry. You have to get them out of
there!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: How does the distress signal look?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Uh, it’s ok, everything’s going to be ok…now
I’m counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don’t want them
to panic.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’ll do my best.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: So what’s going to happen to you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m staying with the ship. I’ll be all
right. Now hurry.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you
again?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hopefully sooner than later.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Sooner than later.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Over and out.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Here goes…nothing…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the hell was that??</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the hell!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What the hell!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is happening around here!!!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: There’s no time to explain. Get everyone
together! We found a way to the pods!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where’s Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He’s up on the bridge! He’s going to be OK.
Now who’s missing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just Carlo.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Carlo?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Carlo!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Carlo!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: Oh Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: God damn it…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Look, we’re running out of time. We have to
jettison as soon as possible or we’ll be out of the gravitational pull.
Come on…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: There was nothing you could have done. The
thing to do now is save yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m right behind you…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You stupid kid, you were so close… You stupid
kid…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Goddamn it…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Everybody in! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you waiting for?! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I’m going back for Taylor!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you nuts! It’s too risky!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: He told you what to do!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: He didn’t know there was room! Initiate the
blastoff! We’ll be back in five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>delbert</strong>: They’re not gonna make it!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s not time yet!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: We have room! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What do you mean? What happened!</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: We don’t have time. I’ll explain later,
hurry!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Goddammit where are they?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give them time!</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Jesus, come on!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They’re not going to make it!</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: They’re not going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re not going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: God help them.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: So close…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And so far.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: There’s only one thing left to do.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Strap yourself in! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>fade in</strong>: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dawn…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: As if it matters.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well…we made it. There it is.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Just the way I thought it would look.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I never thought this would happen. No
premonitions, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It did. It is. There’s nothing we can do
about that.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Except write our wills.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’d like to do something before that.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Marry you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s right. Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.
I guess it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It would matter to us.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: In that case, I accept.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Good. In that case, I pronounce us man and
wife.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What about a ring?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s all I could do on such short
notice.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Let’s go for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You know, for our honeymoon. DISSOLVE TO EXT
MOON SURFACE - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Right now it’s about 8 o’clock at home. People
are going to work, kids are going to school…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Try not to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Oh my God… Taylor look at her, then turns in
the direction she’s looking -</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: What is it?!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know. Wave to them!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: They see us! They know we’re here!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It can’t be…</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It is!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Are there any others?</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Come on aboard.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: And so we were saved. The freighter found Mac
floating through the void, quite by accident, and through this simple
twist of fate two little people made it off the moon.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Later we would find out the lifepod made it
safely back to earth, where the adventures of Anna Koros and Warren
Wayne became the tabloid story of the year.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: As for Ryan Taylor and me, we decided to stay
married after all, although we got new rings. But for the time being, it
was time to head back to the comforting bonds of a small blue planet
called home.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: It never looked so beautiful.</p>
