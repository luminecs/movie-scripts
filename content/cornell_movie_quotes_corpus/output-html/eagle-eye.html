<p><strong>pov though a long-range scope</strong>: the caravan as seen
by a TWO-MAN SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils
the cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV , rigging it
with EXPLOSIVES:</p>
<p><strong>special forces leader</strong>: We have visual onthetarget.
Confirm ‘go’ for UAV launch.</p>
<p><strong>super: “joint operations center, the pentagon”</strong>:
Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER . Beside him: COLONEL THOMPSON .</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: Alpha One, you’re confirmed ‘go’:
active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero.</p>
<p><strong>pentagon techie #1</strong>: We have system control.</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: Activate laser mic.</p>
<p><strong>drone pov</strong>: tracking the caravan, singling out the
MERCEDES. The drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear
windshield –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Is it him?</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: Four males, one of them’s speaking with
a.. I think it’s a Rakhshani•dialect, consistent with our intel on
Al=Khoei.</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: Gimme voiceprint analysis. The
screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT
ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: I’m not taking 37% to-the President…
John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT’S CABINET is
assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room:</p>
<p><strong>director of national intelligence</strong>: CIA and NCTC
concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits. WHIP
TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road.</p>
<p><strong>techie</strong>: Sire they’re pulling off the highway.</p>
<p><strong>techie #2</strong>: We have abort recommendation. The
ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: “RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION.” The source of this
recommendation, for now, remains a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: If it’s him, this guy comes out of
hiding once in a lifetime, we can’t let him go.</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Alright, stay with him…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan
approaching the commune.</p>
<p><strong>intercutting - the pentagon ops room</strong>: the computer
pinpoints DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site
–</p>
<p><strong>techie</strong>: We’ve got AK-47’s, RPC’s, Chaparral guided
missiles –</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: Looks like a training camp.</p>
<p><strong>the desert</strong>: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN
as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the
file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm.</p>
<p><strong>mid-air with the uav</strong>: It SWOOPS, targeting the man –
SNAP:</p>
<p><strong>the pentagon</strong>: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears.
A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man’s face: “5I$ PROBABLE MATCH
-</p>
<p><strong>techie</strong>: 51%. ‘Abort’ rec holds.</p>
<p><strong>the desert</strong>: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as
they begin MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some
of the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal… a PIT.</p>
<p><strong>the pentagon</strong>: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the
feeds:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: What is that, a weapons cache?</p>
<p><strong>analyst</strong>: Sir, the placement of stones around the
pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam… I think it’s a funeral.
Everyone trades looks – this just got even more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>the desert</strong>: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY
is lifted, shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand… the
procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body…</p>
<p><strong>the pentagon</strong>: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA
CONVENTION</p>
<p><strong>techie</strong>: Sir, striking a funeral would put us in
violation of the Geneva convention.</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: Once this guy’s gone, he’s gone.
The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in –</p>
<p><strong>pentagon general council</strong>: “Hors de Combat” – legally
we’d be open to international prosecution. But we have no independent
intel verifying it’s in fact a funeral, and the presence of weapons
certainly leaves room for interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>techie #2</strong>: I have POTUS calling from Air Force
One.</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: . Everyone agree this is the best course
of action? No one dissents. Callister picks up:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity
match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some possibility he’s at a funeral,
but we don’t know. Regardless, counsel thinks we can claim ‘Overriding
Legal Authority.’ Also, you should be aware we have an abort
recommendation, but your cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs urge a
‘go.’</p>
<p><strong>the president</strong>: You left yourself out of the lineup.
Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Yessir… we gauge our strategy by two
standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of
collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don’t have either one.</p>
<p><strong>general thompson</strong>: And if it is Al-Khoei and he
walks, Sir, we’re putting our people at risk. There’s a long silence as
the President considers.</p>
<p><strong>the president</strong>: I respect your caution, Geoff, but we
won’t get another chance like this… you have a green light. Callister’s
obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Understood. We’re weapons free. And with
deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:</p>
<p><strong>techie techie 2</strong>: – Switching to Tac-2, – MTS active,
painting the acquisition’s good – target –</p>
<p><strong>drone pov</strong>: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE
NOSE-CONE as it LAUNCHES its missile – it ZOOMS toward the funeral
gathering – The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL… in the moment before
impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain… a herd of running
gazelles… the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand over the shrouded
body in the pit… a CHILD’S HAND grasping his mother’s…</p>
<p><strong>hold in white:</strong>: CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP… a
digitized electronic scan, as if they’re being analyzed by someone: “We
the people of the United States… more perfect union…” Highlights of The
Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence… We land on: “…whenever
any form of government becomes destructive…it is the right of the people
to alter it or to abolish it…” CLOSE IN on these last words: “ABOLISH
IT.”</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: damnit…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You gotta make a choice. You gotta move–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – I know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now. Who are you gonna be? So Jerry makes his
move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING CARD representing a group
of DWARVES. He sits across from KWAME, 17. They’re playing a geeky
role-playing CARD and DICE game, CASH on the table.</p>
<p><strong>jerry kwame</strong>: there. Dwarves?: Bullshit – Bullshit? I
just blocked your ass and attacked with Ancient Mastery points.
–.dwarves don’t have that – – read the oracle text, my friend. – shit A
thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK:</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: You know what would be great? If you guys
took a longer break. That’d be awesome.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, Becky? When’re you going to start
wearing makeup? Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry:</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: .The collator’s broken.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Dude: no its not.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Oh yeah it is, dude! She heads out as Jerry
collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own smock as Jerry offers him a
quick lesson:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Your first mistake? Underestimating dwarves.
Power can come from anywhere – tomorrow night I’ll give you first roll
and a bonus pack if y–</p>
<p><strong>kwame</strong>: I’m not gonna be here tomorrow, remember? I’m
going to Cornell. And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever
we are, this kid’s off to a bright future. But not Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That – wow. Good for you. So it’s your last
night. You’re gonna spend it collating.</p>
<p><strong>kwame</strong>: – what? But she said the collator’s
broken.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And that’s why we have those rubber thimbles
in the drawer –.congratulations on Cornell, though, that’s huge! TRACK
WITH HIM out to… A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his</p>
<p><strong>nametag</strong>: “JERRY.” Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER
CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it
up:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Welcome to Kinko’s, how can I help you? The
CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and
louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF:</p>
<p><strong>shepard smith</strong>: a heightened terror alert due to a
series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly
attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House
has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as
responsible…</p>
<p><strong>al-jazeera footage</strong>: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated
into ENGLISH:</p>
<p><strong>spokesman</strong>: Your embassies were only the beginning!
Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership
is removed from power, Allah’s revenge is upon you! And during all this,
Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What
a fucking world…</p>
<p><strong>a door opens</strong>: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry’s elderly
Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know
what’s coming:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the
greatest thing I’ve ever smelled in my life, I swear to God –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: is schab wieprzowy po polsku – you
have the rent, yes?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – here’s some of it – most of it – but I’ve
got something else for you… something special… Eyebrows bobbing.
Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can’t resist
him –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So I think. No, I’m pretty sure that’s the
best one so far —</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Yes. Is good – rent is better. She
puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: You are hungry, I am guessing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, no, no. I couldn’t – Unless, you know,
you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their
routine.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: So where is girl? I don’t see
her?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, the redhead? No. She… that’s over. She
got smart.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Like the others.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, womenareIpretty smart. I’ve
discovered.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: You are like Johann. Jerry stops
eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Your – I’m like your dog?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador.
But he believe… he is terrier. So is Labrador… but no labrador. Somehow
Jerry can’t get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: why do you think that is? As she pours a
drink into a plastic cup –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Perhaps many things. When I rescue
Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: As puppy. They kick him when baby,
make him feel not big. You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at
her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: This is – vodka – Jesus, its eight- thirty in
the morning –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: – you cannot eat bigos without
vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again – as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He
looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Is the girl? Answer. Tell her
you’. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we’ve
PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something’s
affecting him deeply. He says, quietly:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: its my mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Is problem?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: is problem.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, mom… Jerry stands there in silhouette.
LISTENING. Something is happening… .suddenly he loses his balance –
sinks to the floor, phone to his ear – staring in pain –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – no! I– I’m not him! All eyes on him. His
voice, sad, heartbroken:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s okay! I’m not Paul! Locks eyes with his
MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew. Their eyes red from crying,
withered shells. And Jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly
up to the COFFIN. Devastated, he leans in – and we MOVE AROUND to see
the body: And it’s fucking HIM – Jerry’s very own face, but one that
seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident. Gruesome
and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry’s identical twin.
Off the surreal moment… A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In
fact, it’s:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Okayokay… okay: we came home, put down the
leftovers, you turned on the TV, I went over, I said no TV– She turns to
the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns her, momentarily, but
she doesn’t break stride –</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: – we’re gonna be late, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – absolutely not – I turned it off, came
over here, checked messages, put the leftovers in the–</p>
<p><strong>kyle rachel</strong>: –knocked over the phone– –right,
knocked over the phone, put it back, put the food in the fridge– She
opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container. Kyle hits a
high note and we SLAM TO:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: we need to get a new car –</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I like your car. We’re gonna be late. The
engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows up
ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No we’re not: the bus.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: – are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I put vitamins in your toiletry bag, don’t
forget to take two in the morning –</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: and one at night, I know –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And your inhaler, which I may need to use
now, is in the outside pocket – wait! They rush back to a MAILBOX, she
pulls bills from her purse:</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: More bills?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yup – that’s what happens when you have a
kid on lay-away. They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS
PAST the WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic:</p>
<p><strong>oh, shit! stay here!</strong>: Rachel waves her arms at
oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC–</p>
<p><strong>you swore!!</strong>: As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and
HONKING around her:</p>
<p><strong>hey, a little common courtesy, asshole!</strong>: And she
runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox –</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel
looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING THE BUS STOP.
PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!!</p>
<p><strong>rachel:</strong>: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts
fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Scuze us, coming through, sorry – WAIT!!</p>
<p><strong>wait!!</strong>: Finally they arrive. Kyle’s teacher, MRS.
MILLER, smiles:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. miller</strong>: Under the wire –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hi – sorry – Rachel Holloman, we met–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. miller</strong>: – of course, Barbara Miller. You should
probably – And Rachel’s stomach drops. Knows they’ve been racing towards
this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle
to face her –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome
time –</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I will, mom –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – you can eat junk food, just remember to
brush your teeth; and if you’re gonna goof off, just be really smart
about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really
cranky when you do that’– He gets very contrarian if he doesn’t get at
least eight –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. miller</strong>: I’m afraid it’s time to board,
Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel’s eyes. She tries to hide them.
Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You see all these kids? They’re all calling
their mothers. You just do it more –</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It’s only two days,: mom. Y’know… you could
try and some have fun too, wouldn’t kill ya..</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fun? What’s that? I love you so much,
baby.You’re my everything. Rock the house.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: – love you too – They separate – she watches
as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Call me!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. miller</strong>: Your mom gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: It’s unclear. As they head into the train,
Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle’s
TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it’s ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED
AWAY FROM THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS – down a separate belt, where it emerges
in a pick- up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by… A MIDDLE EASTERN
MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing – he touches his
ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person.
What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side
is a decal: “HASSAD DRY CLEANERS.” Loads the trumpet inside as we:</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: you didn’t know either?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p><strong>woman #3</strong>: I knew he had a brother. But not a twin,
that was…</p>
<p><strong>woman.#1</strong>: I know, I know… Four WOMEN sit together.
Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where
Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We’re CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass,
etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his
childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up
there. So he does. We MOVE with him:</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: when was the last time they saw him?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Margaret said years…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It’s WILLIAM. Their father. The worst
day of this man’s life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Six months without a boo or a bah.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Didn’t realize it’d been that long.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Your mom was worried. So where were you
this time?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Nowhere. Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks.
got a job for a while. On a…fishing boat. Met some great p-</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: – that’s nice. Looks like you’re really
seeing the world.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m trying, you know, just to – But William
has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there,
frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back – tightly,
grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says,
quietly, through tears:</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You sound just like him. Jerry’s eyes find
a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in
support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his
pocket:</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I want to give you some, uh…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No. – Dad, I’m okay. I’m doing really well. I
promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars.
It’s a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride to
reject the offer? And the answer is…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO
STARES, STUNNED. The screen reads: “BALANCE: $750,000.00” What the HELL?
Glances back to the people behind him, they want him to hurry. He hits
“Cancel.” But the machine, as if disobeying, spits out five $100
bills–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – whoa – Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN
MORE $100 bills-come out. He glances at the people in line, nervous–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – two seconds, sorry – Eyes flick back to the
ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand, pushes “cancel” again and again.
But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting
JAMMED’ in the slot. People start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to
keep the cash from flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He
stuffs all the money in his pocket. Everyone’s staring.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Big date. So… fingers crossed.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: Jerry! All day they make delivery!
Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath – shoves a thousand
dollars into her hand:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Here’s the rest of the rent – next month’s,
too –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: – where do you get this?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just take it – it’s okay, I owe you –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wierzbowski</strong>: I had to open your apartment, too
many packages come, they come for hours –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – hello? A WOMAN’S VOICE. We can’t place why…
but it’s really creepy.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Look out your window. They’re coming
for you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – what? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Jerry. You have to run.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Who the hell is this?! Rips back the curtain
to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP – a flack- jacketed TEAM pours out,
assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Leave your residence. Get to the
Mathis train station. You have 4 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Jesus Christ – what’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Run, or you’ll be captured and
convicted – go NOW. CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE.
Jerry whirls, goes out to the hall, hears THEM coming. Starts to run.
But a</p>
<p><strong>team leader jerry</strong>: Hands behind your head! DOWN
WHAT’S GOING ON? HEY! IS</p>
<p><strong>will fire! didn’t do anything!</strong>: Jerry’s SLAMMED to
the ground as we CUT TO –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Look, man, I don’t know what this is – I
don’t know how all that shit got in my apartment, but unless you’re my
lawyer–</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: My condolences. I understand you’ve had a
tough day.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: it hasn’t been ideal.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Your brother worked for the State
Department. This was almost a question. And while it’s obviously news to
us, Jerry clearly knew…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Were you close?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why? What am I doing here. I don’t even know
who you are. Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal
table. It lands open with a substantial CLUNG!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Tom Morgan, Special Agent attached to the
National Counterterrorism Center.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Counterterrorism Center? You think I’m –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: – according to phone records, your brother
called you twelve times in the last year. You never called him back.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If you’re asking if we were the kind of
freaky twins you see at the mall wearing the same shirt, no. Listen,
Paul traveled a lot, so we didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Oh. That’s right. He stamped visas in
Karachi for a year. Then was a junior FSO in Beirut. Interesting
places.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’re you… saying.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I’m just saying you didn’t talk much. maybe
you did.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Am I getting a lawyer here? ’Cause didn’t
hear my rights read to me–</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: You familiar with the slogan, “Declare War
on War?”</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: what? No, why? Morgan pulls out a
SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a STUDENT RALLY holding up a
sign with an image of the Pentagon crossed out in red: “DECLARE WAR ON
WAR!”</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Because you painted it when you were part of
the student activist group “Project Underground” at Berkley.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wait. Come on – okay: her name was Julia, she
was the smokinist girl I’d ever seen and she wanted me – I would’ve gone
to an “Anti-Oxygen” rally for her. I swear to God, dude–</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Don’t “dude” me. I’m not your friend. I
don’t have friends… so: Jerry. Why’d you drop out of school?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why’d you stay in? I don’t know, I didn’t
really see the point.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: You haven’t been able to hold a job</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Unless I’ve been fired from Kinko’s, which is
a statistical impossibility, I’m holding a job right now.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Construction work, bartender in Singapore,
telemarketing, real estate office, messenger, supermarket sign painter,
taxi driver, gas station in Florida, fishing boat in Alaska–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – what can I say? Guess I haven’t found
myself yet –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Who deposited the seven-fifty?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: For as second I thought God, maybe. The ATM
was obviously broken – or do.. accidents not happen in your .
universe?</p>
<p><strong>morgan jerry</strong>: The money originated from the –this is
all – listen, this HSBC bank of Singapore – is all very interesting –
but opened with a transfer from a this has nothing to do with
corporation called ‘The Star me! Do you understand? of Orion,’ a dummy
front for Hezbollah. This morning Majid – alright, this is insane, I
Al-Khoei says the agents.of want a lawyer– destruction are already
inside our borders– – we find hardware in your – I told you, it all just
apartment, latest military showed up there’. You’re not spec, airplane
manuals, plus listening to me! twelve hundred pounds. of– sit your ass
down now – ammonium nitrate fertilizer. Just curious if you knew any of
Paul’s friends in Beirut, or if he knew any of your friends – what do
you mean in Singapore, oh but that’s “friends”?! right, we haven’t
really established whether or not you two were close– – I guess we were
rett close when I looked into his open casket this morning and saw the
bad make-up job covering the gash in his skull! Or how about when I
watched him being lowered into the ground – that establish anything for
you?! Somebody set me up! Morgan stares at him, unmoved.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: “Somebody.” Who?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: A woman, I don’t know! She called me and told
me I was gonna be arrested. GET</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: No more than Abdul Hamid, Taliban POW we
caught in Afghanistan. Except his real name was Johnny Walker Lindh.
Grew up in Marin County with a basketball hoop in his driveway and a
carton of Tropicana in his fridge. He was blonder than you.. though.</p>
<p>****: When I come back, you’d better tell me who you work for– And
heads out the door, SLAM! Jerry yells;</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: He fits the profile: disaffected,
’susceptible to radical indoctrination, problem with authority. Doesn’t
vote or pay taxes, but witness statements all say he’s not a player. He
does sketches of his landlady’s dog. Oh, and he’s lying about the woman
who called him – we checked the records, no calls came in before we
picked him up –</p>
<p><strong>krebs</strong>: What about the brother?</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past
three years. No red flags. He was killed when a truck ran a light in
Crystal City.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: That kind of equipment and a major cash
infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying
“coincidence?”</p>
<p><strong>krebs</strong>: So either he’s a rank-and-file sleeper or a
dumbshit mule.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Or a misdirect. There’s nothing subtle about
him or the gear. He’s not exactly a pro– Morgan levels a look at Grant
as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring out the next move:</p>
<p><strong>krebs</strong>: Get Smith on financials; Rieger on travel;
and let’s dryclean family and friends. Again.</p>
<p>****: I don’t want the FBI rushing in on this. Break him. Fast. And
leaves Morgan to twist.. The pressure’s on. To Latesha:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: v m m putting you on the brother.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Great, I’ll access State’s database</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: No, I want you to go there.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: But, Tom, I can do everything from</p>
<p><strong>morgan’s voice</strong>: you know those funny things
underneath that not-so-stylish pantsuit? They’re called leas. Latesha
looks at him, not happy.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Yes. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: You know I hate it when you call me that– He
turns to go, Grant immediately following him –</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Follow me and don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He’s out of town.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Which seems like a perfect ;opportunity for
a second date. In theory.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: In theory – but I gotta site-check this
brief, courier’s coming in,.,the morning.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Didn’t we have a good time? Remember that?
Our first date? Back in the 40’s? He’s so agreeably genuine, she wants
to let him down easy:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I had a great. time, I told you that but I’m
so busy and…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ooo.o, shit, the “so busy” speech – stop –
not worthy of you. Or me. I’m patient, so… call me. When you’re not
busy.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kyle goes to college in nine years– it
should be somewhere around then.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I would so wait a decade for you. Call me
his sophomore year, I’ll prove it. And with a smile he heads off. She
watches him go – dammit! really liking him in this moment. She watches
longer than she should… then goes back to her work. He gets in the
elevator and she’s left in her solitude. And now we BEGIN TO SEE the
first signs of it: loneliness.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The consequence of not really letting
anyone into her life. She stares off as BLING! An IM box pops up on her
screen: “RACHEL HOLLOMAN. ANSWER THE PHONE.” And just like that the
PHONE RINGS. Rachel jumps. Staring at the IM. Then at the phone. Answers
it:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – hello? It’s the same chilling FEMALE
VOICE:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Click on the link at the bottom of
the page. Rachel’s eyes drop down to the LINK at the bottom of her
screen. What? Leans out from her cubicle to look around – NO ONE
ELSE</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: who is this? As she clicks on the link. And
a STREAMING IMAGE APPEARS: A</p>
<p><strong>black and white surveillance cam ofkyle on his train,
laughing</strong>: WITH OTHER KIDS. Rachel’s breath is taken away–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s going on? Who are you –?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Would you risk your life for your
son? Rachel jumps to her feet,: trying to breathe through the panic.
Looking around. NO ONE -</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: This isn’t funny! Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Ican derail his train. I can kill him
at any time. I’ll ask again: would you risk`. your life for your son?
Suddenly the BROWSER GOES BLANK: “UNABLE TO ACCESS PAGE.” Kyle’s taken
from her, that fast – she gasps, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: yes…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Follow my instructions precisely.
There’s a vehicle parked at the northeast exit of your building. The
keys are in the ignition. Start walking. Now. CLICK. Off Rachel’s
stunned, terrified face –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Time for your phone call.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I thought there was no phone call.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Attorney General’s office changed their
mind.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: hello? Dad–?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I told you to. run. You didn’t. TIGHT
ON JERRY now, terrified, breathless –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: .no wav – who are you?! Behind Jerry; the
steel door UNLOCKS – he whirls to the OPENING DOOR – waiting for a Guard
– someone, anyone… BUT NO ONE</p>
<p><strong>comes.</strong>: :: What the hell is this?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Follow the water. Or the fire will
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What fire?! How’d you get on this phone?! Are
you the one doing all this to me? Why?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Follow the water. Leave the building
– – and Jerry SPINS BACK. Looks up at a WALL VENT near the ceiling –
SMOKE. Ho-shit! A SMOKE ALARM BLARES –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: – take Brisbane Street to the
elevated train station: you have six minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wait, what d’you mean “follow the water”?
Suddenly: TSHHHHH! Jerry turns – in the hallway, a CEILING SPRINKLER
SPRAYS. The FIRE GROWS, RAGING from the VENT –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Where’s Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Parker took him to make his phone call.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Took him?! On whose authority?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry shaw!!</strong>: Turns through the wild FIRE, Morgan,
at the other end of the corridor – GUN DRAWN:</p>
<p><strong>listen to me! i’m not trying to escape!</strong>: The fire
ERUPTS between them, obscuring each other’s view. No choice, Jerry
turns, HURLS the chair at the WINDOW, IT SHATTERS:</p>
<p><strong>then just as fast, its back to the schedule.</strong>: HOW IS
THIS HAPPENING?! Across the station, Jerry sees Morgan and a team of
Agents pouring down the stairs =- he runs onto the train as the DOORS
CLOSE – Morgan turns, doesn’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>cnn newscaster</strong>: has elevated our alert status to
threat level “Orange.” Insiders say tomorrow night’s State of the Union
address will focus on…</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Next stop, Montrose Station. A CELL RINGS
from a phone peeking out of a SLEEPING PASSENGER’S BACKPACK. He looks at
it, oddly suspicious. The LCD GOES BLACK – then the words “ANSWER IT,
JERRY” appear. Looks around: no one saw it. Slips the phone from the
guy’s backpack – turns away, hits “answer”:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Stay on the train for three more
stations until you r– But Jerry HANGS UP – WON’T HAVE THIS. And as the
train slows, he moves to the door and –</p>
<p><strong>train’s emergency brakes suddenly kick in, gears screech,
people</strong>: TUMBLE… and the train stops. Everyone looks around,
confused, frightened. Suddenly, the train starts MOVING BACKWARDS–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – Jesus –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I told you not to get off yet.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – listen – lady – who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: He knows you’re here. Jerry turns and
sees A TRANSIT COP through the glass doors that connect the cars – he’s
talking into a shoulder-mounted walkie talkie. Looking right at JERRY
–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: –.how do you know that? Where are you? Jerry
notices ANOTHER SECURITY CAMERA in the corner as:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Next stop is Damen Station. Take the
Northwest exit. There will be a black BMW sedan. Get in the passenger
seat.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Go to hell. How’s that. He hangs up, drops
the phone and STOMPS ON IT. Eyes from fellow passengers. THEN EVERY CELL
PHONE ON BOARD RINGING IN UNISON.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jerry watches, stunned, as passengers
start answering – all hearing the same thing:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: The man in the black t-shirt is a
wanted terrorist. His name is Jerry Shaw. Everyone TURNS TO Jerry, backs
away, but a HUGE MAN stands:</p>
<p><strong>huge man</strong>: – you Jerry Shaw? EVERYONE looking, a few
even start to move for him. Jerry goes for the door, but the SUBWAY
COP’S there, about to enter, but the door’s locked. Jerry yells to the
passengers.:</p>
<p><strong>stay away from me!</strong>: The COP pulls his gun, yelling
through the glass:</p>
<p><strong>everybody down! get down?</strong>: Suddenly, the train
SPEEDING, the DOORS OPEN! A BLAST OF WIND! People SCREAM, take cover as
the.train .pulls into the station, the COP about to SHOOT when Jerry
jumps, LANDING HARD ON THE PLATFORM – ROLLS – and the COP FIRES! People
SCREAM and RUN, as the moving train separates Jerry from the Cop – Jerry
gets to his feet, sprints towards the northwest exit and –</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: Okay: WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH – I’m not
doing a thing until ME?! I know for a fact that Kyle’s safe – Do you
hear me? I am not fucking around, you tell me now what this is Do you
hear me? No, you stop - about! - I will not do a thing for you until
–</p>
<p><strong>hey</strong>: I almost died back there! Three times! Shut up!
You shut up and – who?! Who’s Kyle? WHO THE listen to me now! You tell
me HELL IS KYLE?! Kyle is safe! YOU TELL ME</p>
<p><strong>he’s safe goddammit!!!!</strong>: She’s HITTING HIM and he’s
gotta grip her arms to control her –</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry</strong>: MY SON! YOU LET HIM GO! YOU HEY! HEY,
STOP! Wait! HURT HIM AND I WILL KILL You’re not the woman who YOU!!!
called me? And Rachel, out of breath, realizes: holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: the woman? She called you too?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Drive. – and Jerry and Rachel SCREAM
at the horror of THE;WOMAN’S VOICE COMING FROM INSIDE THE CAR –
how?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: –where’s that coming from?! –who are
you?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I’m using the onboard automotive
telematics system. Drive. Now. KA-BOOOOM!!! The side window EXPLODES
from a GUNSHOT! They duck – Jerry turns to look at,the COPS running
toward the car:</p>
<p><strong>they’re shooting at us?!
drivedrivedrivedrivedrive!!!</strong>: She SLAMS the gas – the car
SCREECHES ONTO THE ROAD, another car avoiding it, SLAMMING into a BUS –
Rachel LURCHES and GRINDS as she shifts gears –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Stay about fifty miles an hour, you
have pursuers.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah, thanks, we’re on it –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Turn left in two-hundred feet. Indeed
they do: TWO POLICE CARS BLAST AROUND A STREET CORNER FOUR BLOCKS BEHIND
THEM – DOPPLER HORNS as we CUT BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – my name’s Jerry Shaw, I’ve been set up –
somehow I don’t know – by –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He dramatically GESTURES around the car,
indicating The Voice.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: One hundred feet.</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry</strong>: – you don’t know anything Your son?!
No, I know about Kyle? nothing! Just like you don’t know how to drive:
use the clutch before you shift, not while you shift, not while you – I
don’t need driving sh– lessons from you, asshole! – you drive like. this
and I’m the asshole?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice ..</strong>: Turn now.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know I got it! And she YANKS the steering
wheel and the.car makes a FRIGHTENING SCREAMING LEFT TURN as we CUT
TO:</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: All units, respond code 3 – suspect’s
headed south on Stanley – Morgan makes a hard right, .tearing around a
corner –</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry</strong>: –the lights are all changing to green…
it’s like… – like they’re changing for us…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Accelerate to sixty – turn right in
four- hundred feet…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – oh, no way –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rachel looks up too – eyes wide: A
TEN-STORY-TALL CONSTRUCTION</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – sixt ! Go to sixty! And suddenly the crane
DROPS THE GIRDERS – Rachel SCREAMS –</p>
<p><strong>shit!!</strong>: And the STEEL BEAMS SLAM INTO THE PAVEMENT,
JUST BEHIND THE BMW,</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – this isn’t happening!!! Tries to DOWNSHIFT
– GRINNNNNNNND!!</p>
<p><strong>clutch! i’m clutching!!</strong>: She tries to shift – Jerry
puts his hand on hers – JAMS THE GEAR SHIFT INTO FOURTH – the car
swerves to avoid a car:</p>
<p><strong>go right go right!!!</strong>: Rachel yanks the wheel, SKIDS
round the corner – more police screech in ahead – she’s forced to VEER
onto a ONE-WAY STREET!</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: Getoffthe street – wait, –WILLYOU SHUT
UP?!!!! no,turnup ahead, keep going –WILLYOU JUST SHUT UP AND –go…wait –
stop – TURN LETMEDO IT!!</p>
<p><strong>here!!</strong>: The BMW barely avoids one collision after
another –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You’ll turn at the next alley: avoid
the police. Rachel skids right, but TWO COP CARS appear. Too late to
stop WHAM! The BMW SMASHES THROUGH – both cop cars go flying.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – you’re doing great –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They’re headed for the harbor! Gimme
roadblocks at Granville and Sheridan!</p>
<p><strong>in the bmw</strong>: Jerry and Rachel speed through an
industrial marina. Up ahead, the intersection’s closed by a POLICE
BARRICADE.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Turn right in two-hundred feet.</p>
<p><strong>morgan’s car</strong>: he SEES Rachel coming right at him.
Just before they collide, she TURNS RIGHT. Morgan SLAMS his brakes – his
car FISHTAILS – the cruisers behind him come to a.stop; but now</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Accelerate to sixty five.</p>
<p><strong>accelerate?! we”re headed for the water!</strong>: – are you
trying to kill us?! – slow down! Jesus, slow down–what the hell’s your
name? YOU! YOU!!! – Oh! Rachel! – Rachel: SLOW THE HELL</p>
<p><strong>down!!!</strong>: Just then: KA-CHUNK!! Something just
SLAMMED onto the ROOF – a high-pitched VREEEEE as he car’s tires SPIN in
overdrive but suddenly FIND NO ROAD BENEATH THEM! And impossibly, as the
brick wall GROWS HUGE coming right at us through the windshield, the car
RISES OFF THE GROUND – LITERALLY FLYING –</p>
<p><strong>how are you doing this?!?! i’m not!!!</strong>: – and now we
REVEAL: A GIANT, INDUSTRIAL MAGNET attached to the top of the BMW,
HOISTING it up on a DOCK CRANE – the jib arm PIVOTS, swinging them over
a CRANE YARD… Minds blown, they swing past the crane’s DRIVER’S SEAT and
see… NOBODY’S AT THE CONTROLS. The crane DIPS THEM toward a wooden
railing overlooking the RIVER – they CRASH THROUGH it. The release arm
DROPS the BMW – Jerry and Rachel SCREAM as they PLUMMET – but the car
doesn’t hit water, instead it falls onto: A GARBAGE BARGE floating
downriver. The car lands in a mountain of trash. The crane STOPS, just
as… Morgan and the cops APPEAR, screeching in at the broken railing.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They jump from their cars, look down
into the river and see NOTHING. Morgan KICKS a trash can, pissed:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Seal the harbor, get divers in the water!
PAN UP TO the horizon… where the garbage barge floats lazily down Lake
Michigan. Jerry and Rachel escaped… for now.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s voice</strong>: This is Kyle. Who is not allowed to.
use this phone with my friends… so leave a message, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Honey? Honey? It’s me – Baby, you need to
call me. Soon as you get this, 1 please – check your messages and.call
me. Sweetie. I love y_ou. And she hangs up, staring’off. CRASH! Jerry’s
knocked the window back – opens the control booth door and enters,
examines the controls. The computer panel reads: “CONTROL OVERRIDE.”</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – this thing’s on auto-pilot or something.
Which doesn’t happen, these barges are operated, by people. He steps
out. In thought, tears in her eyes, Rachel asks:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: D’youthink – she could derail a train?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Are you kidding me? She changed every traffic
light! This woman’s called me on other people’s phones – some dude who
happened to be sitting next to me! His phone rang – it was her! For me!
She broke me out of maximum-security custod in a way I’m not even gonna
tell you cause you won’t believe it – and you saw how she directed us
away from the police, then lifted us outta the world and dropped our ass
onto the ghost barge! Can she derail a train? She could probably turn a
train into a duck. Yes. I think she c–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – but now he stops, because Rachel is
crying. Jerry lamely attempts to backpedal:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I mean… I don’t know, I’m not sure she could
derail a train, what the hell do I know? Rachel brushes her tears away.
Afraid, but fighting it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: My son is on a train. She threatened to kill
him if I don’t do what she says. They share a look. The difference
between them galvanized in an instant. She has something to lose.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You tell me – how does someone do all this?
When: RING! A CELL PHONE. Rachel looks down, hoping it’s Kyle – but it’s
not her phone. They realize the phone’s somewhere in the trash. Jerry
starts digging. It’s nast Finally, he finds it in an old take-out box —
re: the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – you see what I mean? He wipes it off, holds
it to his ear despite the stench;</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You both need to swim to shore. Go to
line tower 108.</p>
<p><strong>“jerry rachel</strong>: “Swim to shore? Are you – she wants
us to swim –?! insane?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Lady, what if I told you we don’t know how to
swim.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: But you do. I’ve seen you at the
beach house. And the female was once a swimming instructor at the YMCA
in Westport, Connecticut. Go now or the authorities will find you.
They’re more dangerous than the water.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CLICK – she’s gone. Jerry hangs up,
turning something unnerving in his mind.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She called you “the female.” That’s like…
something a foreigner would say, like a bad translation. But she has no
accent.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Jerry, that’s your name, right? Are we
swimmincr?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Does it bring back memories of Westport
Y?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: how did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I didn’t. And they turn to look down at the
FREEZING RIVER WATER as we PRE- LAP the SOUND of a clear F SHARP and CUT
TO –</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: You sure you want to replace it? Sounds
pretty good to me. And we reveal MIDDLE EASTERN MAN standing at the
counter. Eyes darting, nervousShoves a small BOX into the man’s
hand.</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: Yes. I’m sure. Please do it now.
The Store Owner looks into the box.</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: I do a lot of custom jobs, never seen
something like this before. I can have it for you by the end of the
week. The Middle Eastern Man. MUMBLING again in Tajiki. Seemingly, to
himself. The Store Owner stares, kinda freaked out –</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: Sorry, what?</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: No. Is not possible. it must be
done this afternoon –</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: Listen, Mister – The Middle Eastern Man
suddenly touches his ear, BARKS out something in Tajiki. Like he’s
arguing with someone.</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: – are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: I will pay you triple. Please. A
courier will be by to pick it:’up at three. Do it, please… please. And
stepping back, he exits quickly. The Store Owner watches him leave, then
looks back down at the BOX.</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: All the surveillance cameras in the
area have turned up nothing – no ID on the girl, nothing on the VIN
–</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: All I want is a goddamn picture of her –
what about traffic cams? There are more cameras on that route than the
Super</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Department of Transpo says there was a
seven minute equipment failure –</p>
<p><strong>morgan agent grant</strong>: Do NOT tell me their equipment
was down! Do NOT! Sir, that’s what they’re telling me… From Northbrook
to the 290?! What about the bogus fax from Justice, was that equipment
failure too? – No sir, there’s gotta be someone on the inside. – ya
think?!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Pissed, Morgan starts – fast – for the
chopper – we move with him and Grant, who keeps up:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: The getaway car was waiting there – get me a
witness description on the woman driving – remember witnesses? People
who see things?! Jesus, is this a lost art?</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: I have Markey on that right now
Morgan’s PHONE IS RINGING – he answers:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Morgan. When? NO. You tell them hold that
’til I talk to Sanford - WTMZ has a report that there’s a terrorist at
large in the.city,– I’m going back to forensics. Find out where the hell
that fax originated.– if you don’t have good news for me before I touch
down you will be demoted to a job that will require you. to touch shit
with your hands –do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Yes sir! As Morgan hops up onto the
moving chopper –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Nobody who works for me calls me sir.
understand?! It’s disingenuous – might as well be calling me ‘asshole.’
As Grant watches the chopper take off, perplexed.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So you’re a twin.</p>
<p>****: Who works at a copy place. And she manages a clipped,
judgemental laugh.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah, I know… that’s occurred to me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So this whole situation is obviously about
him.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Excuse me? I would offer this whole situation
isn’t “obviously” about anything.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Just think about it: you said your brother
worked at the State Department –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – so what?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – so that means he could’ve: been into
anythinc – he was a twin -:- you..received a shipment of weapons and
cash and airplane manuals – it seems to me that they sent the stuff
to.the wrong brother–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wait a minute – you’re suggesting all that
stuff was for Paul? As they approach TOWER 108:</p>
<p><strong>rac he l</strong>: Hey, I’m sorry that he died, I’m not
trying to insult his memory –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: he hasn’t been dead long enough to become a
memory! And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you’d laugh all day at
the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you’re implying
–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m implying if not him… then why you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well hasn’t that been the question my whole
life. You know how I know Paul wasn’t a terrorist? Because if he had
been, he would’ve been the best fucking terrorist in history: he
wouldn’t have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater – he
would’ve won awards for being a great terrorist.</p>
<p>****: What about you? Why’d she choose you – what’s your day job? I
know it isn’t “manual-shift driver.”</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I did just fine driving, thanks. I’m a
paralegal – I have no connection to anything.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really? Suddenly they’re interrupted by the
ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and
on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry’s hand, all their mutual hostility
vanished:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Someone’s coming. And what’s approaching is
the “Hassad DryCleaners.” van. It comes to a stop and out steps the
Middle Eastern Man. Stands some twenty-five feet from them.</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: Are you Jerry Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: who are you? Rachel grabs Jerry’s arm as the
man reaches into his jacket –</p>
<p><strong>jerry middle eastern man</strong>: – Whoa – I dropped it off
like she said. I’m done. The man’s pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL
KEY.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – dropped off what? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: Take it – He TOSSES the key..–
it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between them. Then:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: what’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: I don’t know – I don’t care –
but I will not drive you. You take the van I’m not listening to you any
more! And the man turns to go, just walks away.</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry</strong>: – hey! – wait, who are you?! You have
to tell us what you know!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: And as the man walks away from them his
CELL PHONE RINGS: He pulls it out – the LCD READS: “LAST CHANCE.” And
the man DROPS the phone and just starts RUNNING –</p>
<p><strong>wait!!</strong>: And Jerry takes off after him, he’s not
letting him go. Catches up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round
–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: – let me go!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – who’s doing this? And they begin to
struggle. Middle Eastern Man’s dropped CELL PHONE RINGS. Rachel.
Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its for her – she answers:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Stop him now or he will die.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How are you seeing us?! Jerry and the Middle
Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing. Throwing sloppy punches:</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: Let go of me! On Rachel:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Stop him now. CLICK. Rachel turning
to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Stop! You have to STOP! When the Middle
Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes sprawling. He takes off
again, yelling back:</p>
<p><strong>middle eastern man</strong>: I cannot! I have a family!!!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She’s going to KILL YOU!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: And just then, something TERRIFYING: an
IMMENSE POWER SURGE – HEARD, FELT – and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE
OF AN SUV EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry
TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND STRIKE THE
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET, the current making
the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE. And he’s ON FIRE INSTANTLY – SMOKE
EVERYWHERE as he’s TOSSED BY</p>
<p><strong>air, pummelled down again, burning…</strong>: Jerry and
Rachel watch this in horror – until she looks away. Jerry holding her –
the two in shock, strangers, in each - other’s arms. Having shared
another moment, too real, horror -</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry.</strong>: Oh my God… Oh God… oh We–we have to
do something, God… Oh God… we have to… figure out what to.. what… And
then his PHONE RINGS. And they’re both too afraid to answer it. Another
RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand shaking slightly:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You killed him… you killed that man…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: It was unavoidable. Take the van.
Drive to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street. Arrive no later than
eleven AM. Disobey and you die. CLICK. Rachel’s eyes on Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: she wants us to drive to
Indianapolis.: , – why? What’s there, what? – – I don’t know – – no,
this can’t keep happening! We have to go to the police, explain it –
explain what?! What’re we – I’m not doing it!! I’m not gonna tell them?!
going anywhere! Jerry can see she’s losing it. Grabs her by the
shoulders:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – Rachel. She’s watching us. Right now. You
wanna die too? Your son? We have to go. Rachel looks right at him, still
shaking, knows he’s right. And nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS,
LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT</p>
<p><strong>– stops.</strong>: Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We
PAN a barren landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched
TONE as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck, which
gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION</p>
<p><strong>debris is still ripped into the sky, pieces are coming down
and</strong>: THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS:</p>
<p><strong>“briar point test range – aberdeen, maryland.”-</strong>: And
we hear CLAPPING – PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside:</p>
<p><strong>weapons developer</strong>: That blast was the result of one
single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today,
“Rex” is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers – it’s eighty times
more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. COLONEL THOMPSON, also
from our opening, gestures:</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: Talk about the detonating system…
The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of
compressed air, saying:</p>
<p><strong>weapons developer</strong>: Hex is triggered by an acoustic
frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it
audible – that was the tone you heard before the explosion – the tone
was the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: What’s the risk that another sound could
accidentally detonate it? A song on a radio? A howling dog?</p>
<p><strong>weapons developer</strong>: No: the pitch is uniquely
programmed and impossible to reproduce.</p>
<p><strong>colonel thompson</strong>: Fine job.</p>
<p><strong>weapons developer</strong>: Thank you, sir. We’re proud of
this ordnance – all of us at Halloway-Smith. And while we still HEAR HIM
SPEAKING, we CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>weapons developer.</strong>: If you’re satisfied with today’s
final test, the Hex Project has met every… contractual objective. The
arms package each into separate . containers, fit them with shipping
labels marked: “PENTAGON DIRECT.”</p>
<p><strong>weapons developer</strong>: And we’re hoping this moves us
into the next scheduled phase… shipping the product into the field.
Drift toward an unmanned computer. The screen FLICKERS: “OVERRIDE IN
PROGRESS,. CHANGE SHIPPING DESTINATION.” Robot arms grab a wrapped
package off the line. A new label’s printed:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Whaddya got?</p>
<p>****: Those funny things underneath my not-so- stylish pantsuit? They
brought me all the way to the Pentagon. Paul Shaw wasn’t State –</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: – he was Defense.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: You’re kidding me. What capacity?</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Black-file: classified B-36.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: B what?</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: That’s the point. No one’ll tell me. I
cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to the Intel committee, NSA gave
me..nothing. Krebs doesn’t want me to ruffle any feathers. I’ve been up
and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I’m a – WHEN an MP
suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping her. He towers over
her –</p>
<p><strong>mp</strong>: Interns aren’t allowed on this floor, miss.
You’ll have to – When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I’ve got
clearance, pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: – sorry.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Everybody in this place have a six-foot
height requirement? Anyway. I’m going back to the office to–</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: No, no, no –</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: – I got the Williamson County Sheriff on the
line – Morgan holds up a hand, one second. To Latesha:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Look, I don’t have time for this – stay
there til you get some answers –</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: – but its a total shut out –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Simms: step up –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: – I don’t care if you have to go to the. top
to do it. Whatever means necessary, got it? Whatever means. CLICK.
Latesha lowers the phone. A HUGE:PAINTING of the battle of EL-ALAMEIN
looming behind her. Shelooks..back down the hallway as all the BRASS
heading into the MEETING ROOM and catches sight of – CALLISTER amongst
them. Latesha hesitates. For just a second. Shit. Shit. This is it.
Before suddenly rushing forward and calling out –</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him
briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room. And SLAM.. The
doors close in Latesha’s face.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Well, shit.</p>
<p><strong>indianapolis</strong>: YOUR HOME TOWN!” Jerry drives,
pensive. Rachel stares out the-window, the shock of what she’s seen only
fueling her rage at the whole situation.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: how old is he? Your son.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kyle. He’s nine.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s he doing on a train? She really
doesn’t want to talk. BUT:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He goes to a music magnet. His school’s on a
tour of Washington. They’re playing at the Kennedy Center.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: wow. And you. Hm. She turns to him. Eyes
burning into the side of his head. Knows what he’s thinking.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Parents weren’t allowed to go… is that okay
with you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Is it okay? I could give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Then what’s with the qualified nod?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not allowed to nod?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Not if you’re iudging me.–</p>
<p><strong>jerry.</strong>: Judging?! I’m just making conversation.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You think I should have gone with him
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m just thinking, sounds like a big deal,
especially for a 9-year-old – playing at the Kennedy Center – I’d just
think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yeah? How do you know Kyle’s dad isn’t
there?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, you’re not wearing a ring and you
haven’t mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most
pissed off ex-wife – which I’m not saying you aren’t – would’ve
mentioned it if her ex’s life was threatened – and if Kyle was going to
meet his dad in DC? You would’ve tried to call him, too. So where is he?
Kyle’s dad?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: As if it’s any of your business – you know
what you are –?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Insightful? Intuitive? A better driver than
you –?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – you’re one of those “thirties are the new
twenties” man-children. You’re glib and wry and find humor in people
like me who are actually accountable for the ir lives –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay, the most fascinating thing here? Is
that you don’t know the first thing about me!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know you work at a copy store! What are
you, thirty-one, thirty-two? You’re obviously articulate</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – love being stuck in a van with my fucking
guidance counselor –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – and I know your brother just died and he
worked for the State Department –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – you need to stop talking about my brother,
I’ve had enough of that –</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry</strong>: – you’re in denial if you – Ham: I’m
not talking about don’t think that has anything this – to do with what’s
happening right now -= – Dammit!! I’m not kidding! :but I can tell you
that Stop! STOP! whatever he did, whatever he was part of has put my son
in danger whether you believe it or not!! SCREECH! Jerry YANKS the wheel
hard, PEELING across four lanes of traffic. SKIDS to a stop by a curb,
pops open the door.</p>
<p><strong>jesus!–what’re you d–?’.</strong>: Jerry gets out, SLAMS his
door shut –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You can’t leave me!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Why not? My brother’s a terrorist, and I’m a
loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her
door</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t walk away!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re on your own. Rachel starts running
after him,panicked, leadin :</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops
short. Turning around. Cupping his ear.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m sorry? What’d you just say?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I can’t do this without you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You mean without the “man-child?” Rachel’s
reserves crumble.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Its the first time we’ve been apart, me and
Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train– – I
let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this
woman’s eyes. They’re both in pain. Points his finger right at her.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No more accusing my brother of shit you know
nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding
her voice again –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back
in the van.</p>
<p><strong>the charred face of the middle eastern man, frozen in a
scream.</strong>: Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER
trying to keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene.</p>
<p><strong>power worker</strong>: Never seen anything like it. Power
blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can’t
explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth
bared.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: No I.D. We know he’s male, though. Probably
in his 20’s. Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three.
Three sets of shoe prints.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: And we’re about 4 miles from the river –
Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some
rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call:</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Agent Morgan!” Just got off with HQ.
The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside
Justice.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Inside?! You absolutely sure on that?</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Yes, s– Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Got something – As the M.E. pulls
something out of Middle Eastern Man’s ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small
WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the
TWEEZERS –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Looks like a bone mic, military grade.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Can’t even get these things on the black
market. Someone was talking to him. Something’s rotten in Denmark. No,
something’s rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for
the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him:</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: We’ll be needing that for evidence!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: a Federal bank?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal
Prison.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I’m Mr. Bids. I
understand you’re in a hurry, why don’t I show you to your box.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: yes, thank you, we’d… like that. The manager
walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The
manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on
it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: “SAXON, CARL.”
Jerry’s eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits
perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel
table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the
box.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You gonna open it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Maybe it’s not gonna be so bad.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yeah… maybe it’s something good.. They meet
eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO GLOCK PISTOLS and the
same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of the Middle Eastern Man’s ear.
A note.: “EAR:MIC. NOW.”</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: Oh, shit – it’s bad – They look at
each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice over mic</strong>: Both guns are loaded,
safety’s off. In sixty seconds,’:two,men Will exit the adjacent vault
carrying a briefcase. Take it – by force if necessary – then exit the
building.. Jerry can’t fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – what?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – I don’t suppose – there’s any easier way
to`get whatever the hell it is you want – is there? Miss? But she’s not
answering.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What now – what are we?</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: – they’re coming–we’re supposed to rob
them – – are you kidding me?!?! – just take i t– – no! Jesus! I don’t
even let Kyle play with water guns! – hey, I applaud your parenting
skills – take it! The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear…
the.-BRINKS COURIERS from the lobby; one of them’s carrying a METALLIC
BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist – the other spots Jerry’s gun and REACTS,
going for his gun:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t! The men freeze – Jerry holds his gun
awkwardly –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Uh… hi. How’s it going. Put. it on the floor.
The briefcase. We don’t wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys – just –
we need the case.</p>
<p><strong>courier #1</strong>: You’re bringing a shitstorm on your
heads, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I think we’re already mid-shitstorm. Do it.
The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination
into the case’s padlock, the cuff POPS free from his wrist. He slides it
over to Jerry, who reaches for it… AND COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE –
SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to
the ground, the BONE MIC falling out of his ear… he turns, shit! Sees it
skitter under the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance:
snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator – Rachel rushes him,
trips him – he falls, dazed – Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly
FLIPS him on top of the steel table, SLAMS Jerry’s head into the
counter, unholsters a back-up GUN from his ankle – brings the barrel up
as: BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the gun
that was kicked across the floor:</p>
<p><strong>drop the gun asshole!</strong>: Courier #2 drops it; Jerry
rises, wipes blood from his lip. Rachel is fucking on fire, she’s so
tough. AKA: a mother.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Gimme the case. Now. They do – and Jerry and
Rachel back into the elevator with it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: impressive. Thanks. The door closes on
them, and we CUT INTO:</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry</strong>: – whoa–what is that? – a timer – it’s
counting down– – they do.that – what’s it mean?! – I dunno, the only
things with timers I can think of are microwaves and… – and bombs, you
were gonna say bombs – some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers…
– yeah, Jerry, it’s an egg timer – What is SHE saying about it –? I
dunno, I – – What do you mean you. don’t know?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You lost the mic, Jerry. That’s not
optimum. JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Would you stop doing that?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: There will thirty five seconds of
disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to
the stadium’s VIP parking area unexposed.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Is this a bomb?! ’Cause I am not walking out
with a bomb! Hey! You! But she’s done talking. As the elevator DOORS
SLIDE OPEN–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Like you got into a fight. Me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men
race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel walk RIGHT PAST them, starting
across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS
PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump
out drawing their weapons. Rachel tensing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK
above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel
over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Two jerseys and two hats, please –</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Peyton or Vinatieri?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know what that means –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Jerry…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Uh… both. The two COURIERS running out of the
bank. POINTING RIGHT AT JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone
starts RUNNING TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Put these on –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They put on the hats and jerseys,
hurrying towards the stadium. Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor
screaming that they didn’t pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a
stop. Jerry, sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3..
2..</p>
<p><strong>colts fans pour out wearing identical blue hats and
jerseys.</strong>: The game’s over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel
are lost in a sea of blue and white – it’s impossible to spot them.
Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them – Jerry takes
Rachel’s arm, working against the current towards the VIP parking area.
A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees them, hurriedly puts down his
paper. Opening the door –</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the
game.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Thanks, uh, we’re in kind of a hurry –</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by
the.chauffeur’s libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish
behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the
limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: “JUST MARRIED.”</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Afternoon… afternoon, sir… afternoon…
afternoon, General… Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out,
flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world’s on his shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Secretary Callister? He looks back,
preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I
need to ask you a question, sir –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Not now, you can direct it to my
office.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: It’ll only take a minute, sir, thirty
seconds – B-36? Can you tell me what it is? ’Cause its not –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: – you don’t have clearance, Agent Simms,
and I don’t have thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: So should I assume it has something to. do
with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just
ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the
hell–?</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: I just checked the intel, sir, we have some
of the same indexes –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: You need to stop assuming. And he moves
on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage
filled with lions. Until she ROARS:</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the
hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this
woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of
him:</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: My Department’s tracking a home-grown
terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with
ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back
there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror
threat rising every three hours, I’m going to just have to assume you’re
in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three… so
with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me
what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap
of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb.
She’s hit a chord deep inside him. It’s called balls. SLAM TO:</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please –
Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No! 2 trot it. Thanks, though.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: So, where’d you two get hitched?</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: Reno. Niagara Falls. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry rachel</strong>: Niagara Falls. Reno. Shit. The “DING”
of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO:</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Agent Simms? Scott Bowman: Welcome to B- 36.
If you’ll follow me?</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Welcome to paradise. Palatial HONEYMOON
SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the bed…</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Minibar, high-speed internet, thousand-
count sheets. And if you’re looking for the TV He clicks a remote and a
72” PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet. On screen, a narrated “virtual
tour”.of the hotel:</p>
<p><strong>tv voice</strong>: dedicated to the highest standards of
luxury and comfort…</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with
eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you’ll pardon my
French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I’m here t2. serve, I’m here to
please… And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry’s still
looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his
pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still
looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: This is nice and everything, but what the
hell are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Nice? One night in this place is more than
one of my paychecks; and that’s before taxes – He heads over to the
minibar. Starts rooting through it, pulling out those tiny bottles of
alcohol…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If we’re going down, I’m gonna go down
singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Can you stop eating for a second? A KNOCK at
the door and they stop arguing immediately.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Answer it. They TURN hearing the
voice: it’s.coming from the T.V. The FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC still dancing
on screen.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: There are items you will need for the
next step. KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the
door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG:</p>
<p><strong>delivery boy</strong>: There y’go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice
day? Jerry takes the bag – the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as
Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag:
hair. dye, clothes…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: The limousine is waiting for you
`downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where are we going now?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What the hell’s in the briefcase?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Your only consideration at present is
to deliver it before the timer expires.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: BULLSHIT! This is crazy! You’re a television
set! You don’t watch me, I watch you! I wanna know what the hell’s going
on!!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: It would not be efficacious to reveal
my intentions.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – “not be efficacious”?! Who the.fuck talks
like that?!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – Jerry –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: We know you’re watching! We know you’re
listening! We know you know•.’everythina. So why don’t you STOP HIDING
AND TELL US</p>
<p><strong>who you are!!</strong>: Nothing. Furious, he moves to.the
WINDOW –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fine, have it your way,.Lady – I’m gonna
scream bloody murder out this window ’til every cop in a fifty mile
radius comes running and I’m gonna tell them everything even if they
think I’m a crazy sonofabitch ’cause at least I won’t have to listen to
you any more!</p>
<p><strong>– jerry –</strong>: He YANKS the window up –</p>
<p><strong>stop.</strong>: He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV
snaps to BLACK – then DIGITAL STATIC – a channel RE-ROUTING through some
distant computer-controlled network. And now: IMAGES – FILE FOOTAGE – a
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT LAB, TECHNICIANS assembling computer components,
putting together a strange- looking SPHERE –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: My name… is Aria. Rachel and Jerry
stare – what the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: It stands for ‘Autonomous Reconnaissance
Intelligence Analyst’… And we reveal “THE TANK.” A glassed-in wall
containing TONS of water. AN AWESOME STEEL SPHERE IN THE WATER,
suspended by a claw-like apparatus. The “brain” of a com uter network.
The very same image Jerry and Rachel just saw on the TV.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Twenty-two hundred tons of super-cooled water
keeps her from overheating – that’s ninety-two thousand processors, the
equivalent of a hundred.millionhuman brains working together
as:,.one…“’</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: an electronic espionage system.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off
satellites. This goes.;. much farther.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: I was created by “DARPA”: the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency in 2002. My primary directive is to protect the
national security of the United States. I have access to track the
economies, populations, and military development of every country in the
world, as well as intercept all global communications – from satellites
to cell phones to credit card transactions. Jerry and Rachel look at
each other – a computer?!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: After 911, our problem wasn’t collecting
data, it was interpreting it fast enough. Ergo: quantum rocessin</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Today there are more microchips than people,
and they can all be data-mined, either via direct connectivity or
wireless signals –let’s say we’re chasing someone with a suitcase nuke
in L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass transit, track the perp
through traffic cameras… and if given the order, she could even turn a
TV into a bomb to take him out.</p>
<p>****: But what if –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: – she can’t act without authorization. See,
she’s bound not to countermand our laws – even the Declaration of
Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role’s
pre-emptive – running simulations, identifying threats before they
become real…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wait, you think we’re a.threat?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: No. You’re a means to an end. On TV,
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS – ZOOM to words in CLOSE UP:</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Under National Security Directive 359,
Sub-Section 72 – “when units are needed for the national defense,
civilians shall be ordered to active Federal service…”</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: you’re drafting us?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The guy you killed in the desert – last time
I checked, murder wasn’t legal.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform
Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So
matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know, more than
anything, is…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: what’d my brother have to do with this? A
picture of PAUL SHAW’S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen:</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the
picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining
from his face.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, he worked for the State Department..:</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your
brother was a Horseman.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s the hell is a ‘Horseman’?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You know, clever allegory – of the
apocalypse’–`except we’re here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID
PHOTOS APPEAR of our four “Horsemen”: PAUL SHAW, SCOTT, and two men
we’ll call LOWELL and JIMMY.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Officially, we don’t exist, but we monitor
Aria’s network 24/7. There were :four of us… til Paul died. He was
smarter than all of us put together.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Working here must be pretty tough – all the
security, the pressure, long hours… As in: “Did you notice him acting
strangely?”</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul.
Except…</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Except what?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: The night he died? He left his shift three
minutes early. Which you don’t do. Which he wouldn’t do. Latesha’s
suddenly locked in on a clue – PRELAP:</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Paul and I had a disagreement before he
expired…</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task.
Simple.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Expired?! You mean died.. That’s what we call
it, we humans, we call it dying–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s the task?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: To insure the national security of the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What d’you need me for then?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: That is not your concern right now.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Alright, this is bullshit. I’m not doing this
— and you’re a computer, you don’t know a goddamn thing about my
brother.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The
screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW’S accomplishments: childhood
birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful
girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with
their dad, William’s arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria’s
reaching into his subconscious:</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Your brother succeeded in everything he
did.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Before he was a year old, he walked. Something
that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted,
intelligent and principled – in fact, the only Horseman ever to
challenge me. But you, Jerry – The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY
FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO’S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame,
slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so
pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it –</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: You are similar to Paul in DNA only.
Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled
in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to
follow.</p>
<p>****: And because you’ve seen what happens to deserters.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: You have 23 minutes to prepare. There’s an
adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE
clicks open.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Use it. And she’s gone, replaced by the
hotel’s promotional prattle –</p>
<p><strong>tv voice</strong>: The Four Seasons prides itself on
excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an
emotional beat…</p>
<p>****: Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the
other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his
shame… then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down:</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Halloway-Smith contracted us to
transport the briefcase to their corporate office…</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Biotech? The chemical company?</p>
<p><strong>brinks courier #2</strong>: When they make a new compound,
they, hold it in a vault for clinical trials.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Why’d the HAZMAT office issue a special
permit for the case?</p>
<p><strong>brinks courier #1</strong>: You’d have to ask – could be`
anything from a boner pill to a bioweapon, they never tell us.</p>
<p><strong>brinks courier #2</strong>: Tell you one thing, though… the
guy never handled a gun before. That LANDS with Morgan. He nods to an
agent, dismissing the couriers. Grant approaches:</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: We pulled video… nothing. No good
angles on Shaw or the girl.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: There.are 14 visible cameras in the lobby! ”
8 hidden no one can see!</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them
ahead of us.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It’s a Federal bank; encryption doesn’t get
more secure.., from now on assume our air’s been compromised, too. Tell
everyone to go secure on Tac-3, nobody communicates outside this task
force without my say-so.</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: I’m on it – also: they found this
upstairs, but the trace signal’s dead – Holds up an evidence bag with
Jerry’s BONE MIC inside.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Do not tell me that is what I think it is.
Goddamnit, who’s leading these people around?! Someone’s behind the
Wizard of Oz! He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the
window of a 7-11. Starts MOVING toward it.–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – Kyle?!</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Hey, mom, it’s. me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – sweetie, where areou, are you – But she’s
INTERRUPTED as she realizes, oddly, it’s a VOICEMAIL – her heart
SINKS:</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Got your message, the train’s awesome – Brian
tried to burp the alphabet but gagged when he got to “M.” I’ll call when
we hit D.C. Bye, ma – Rachel holding the phone like it’s some kind of
life-line to her son. When there’s a strange BEEP then the voice of
ARIA:</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Your son left that message sixty seconds
ago.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ll do whatever you want – don’t hurt him,
please – I’m begging you. Listen - you’re trying to protect something
too, right? You’ll do whatever it takes. Well that’s what it’s like to
be a mother – can you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: There were over 52,000 vocal tone options for
my program; I chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal.
People tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: You’ll see your son again soon. Bute there’s
something I require from you first…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Rachel? We gotta go</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying
the horror of what she’s just heard, what Aria’s just told her to do
–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What? No way, I can’t just –</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: – when the time comes I’ll instruct you to
stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear those words, you’ll have thirty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Rachel? You in there?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Answer Jerry, please.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: ;Jerry still standing outside the door.
Rachel’s VOICE,“mustering strength through the door:</p>
<p>****: Steeling herself, she steps out. Forces a smile while averting
her eyes. And pushes past h2-,n like he’s lagging…</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: I dunno, the whole thing’s off somehow -
but get this: B-36 isn’t a security classification, it’s a sub-level
here at the Pentagon – What? Girl’s gotta groom.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: – you’re shitting me</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Yeah, 36 floors underground – and it gets
weirder:</p>
<p><strong>intercepting call.”</strong>: INTERCUTTING WITH MORGAN IN THE
7-11 – he hears:</p>
<p><strong>latesha’s voice</strong>: Four years ago, DARPA commissioned…
… .computer… …</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Simms? You’re breaking up – WITH LATESHA –
her cell LCD says: “Call lost.” No bars. Muttering “dainnit,” she tries
to call Morgan back. No dice.</p>
<p><strong>aria pqv cam</strong>: Latesha snaps her phone shut, notices
the camera watching her. Unsettling. We read: “VOICE MIMEO
ACTIVATED”</p>
<p><strong>latesha/aria</strong>: Sorry about that – As we realize
Aria’s taken over the call by mimicking Latesha:</p>
<p><strong>latesha/aria</strong>: I’m getting a bad signal down
here.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I heard ‘DARPA’ and ‘computer’ –?</p>
<p><strong>latesha/aria</strong>: Yes, B-36 was part of a super-computer
project, but it was decommissioned. A dead end. The archives are at Fort
Meade. Do you want me to head over there? – but Morgan’s only
half-listening now as he sees. something on the CCTV feeds:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Wait – go back, freeze that -</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: A STILL of Jerry and Rachel getting in
the limo, faces obscured.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Punch up the plate The image enhances,
revealing a PLATE NUMBER, its frame bearing the company name: “ICON
LIMOUSINE SERVICES.”</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Find that car! Simms, gotta jump, sit tight
’til I call.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to
hang up. But stops: did she just call me sir?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Aria’s system uses biometric security to
identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly
his head’s ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his
features: “PROCESSING FOR MATCH… HORSEMAN IDENT</p>
<p><strong>confirmed</strong>: BOWMAN, SCOTT.” Latesha watches somewhat
dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Aria, go voice active, please.</p>
<p><strong>aria over speaker</strong>: Hello, Scott. How may I assist
you?</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: It talks?</p>
<p><strong>aria over speaker</strong>: I’m fluent in 6,800 languages,
41,000 dialects, and 750 extinct tongues.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Aria, this is Latesha Simms, she’s here as
part of a counter-terrorism task force.</p>
<p><strong>aria over speaker.</strong>: A pleasure to serve you,
Ms. Simms.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: . Am I supposed to – Um… what’s up.</p>
<p><strong>scott.</strong>: Aria, I’d like to:bring,up all the log feeds
the night Paul died – when he left the building.</p>
<p><strong>aria over speaker</strong>: Of course. Scott types on the
console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED
springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW
exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the
elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same
walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera –</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: There’s no feed from inside here?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: No need for cameras in here, we’ve got Aria.
Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank.
Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the
elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: So weird… no overt body language, he’s even
casual. Leaving like it’s any other day.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Except three minutes early…</p>
<p><strong>on the monitor</strong>: the elevator doors open and Paul
steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something’s not right. Then… her
eyes NARROW: the way Paul’s facing the button panel. Like he’s
deliberately pivoting away from the camera.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Wait, in the reflection, did you see that?
Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and
facing the button panel. CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel’s REFLECTIVE
SURFACE –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Is he… blinking? Yes. Erratically,
deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly,
the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP –</p>
<p><strong>aria. over speaker</strong>: I’m experiencing interference in
network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Negative, I’m prioritizing this.</p>
<p><strong>aria over speaker</strong>: I’ll note my protest in the data
log. This is getting weirder by the second – PAUL’S DISTORTED REFLECTION
in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly:</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: It’s like he’s trying to say something…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: A code. He’s blinking code</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: It’s not Morse, but there’s a sequence to
it –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Oh, that sonofabitch… He grabs a piece of
paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out,
then converting them to LETTERS –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: It’s a code – Hexadecimal – a number system
that can be converted to letters the first computer used it as a
programming language back in the 50’s. Latesha watches, rapt: R… E. E…
X… T. .”</p>
<p><strong>on the feed</strong>: the elevator door OPENS and Paul steps
out. That’s all they get. They stare, trying to make sense of the
letters:</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: The hell is that? Staring, minds spinning –
and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER between the two “E’s.” Dividing words..
And GETS IT:</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: It’s the only spot in the hallway not
covered by .the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>::</strong>: He was hiding something from her. A SHIFT to
ARIA CAM confirms it: she can’t see exactly what they’re doin Latesha
moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it for something,
anything… but finds NOTHING.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: I don’t get it. He had to be saying ‘Fire
Extinguisher.’ Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Maintenance replaced it yesterday. This isn’t
right… they weren’t supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes.</p>
<p>****: She read the code too… where’s ‘Recyling’?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hey – sorry, I didn’t mean to – am I
drooling? I bet I’m drooling. You didn’t sleep?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Night shifts. I’m used to. Rachel sits up,
sees the napkin. Grins, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Wow, is that me?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: One of my only party tricks.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s really good. Jerry looks down at it,
not used to having his work appreciated. Rachel, can see how deeply
affected he was by what Aria said. It seems to make her feel uuiilty
somehow… kinder…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: About what Aria said… I’m sorry.
They’re;starting to connect. He glances out the window…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You have to understand, I wasn’t his twin, I
was more like his… little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you
wouldn’t believe how… nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were
kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did. Of
course he was involved in some super secret National Security project.
He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I’m the
fuck-up.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I wear it like a medal, like it actually
means something… but the funny thing is? This is probably the most
important thing I’ll ever do. This. Right now. This completely insane
journey or whatever it is. I’m actually needed in something, me. Jerry
Shaw is required. But what am I thinking? I’ll probably fuck this up,
too –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re being too hard on yourself–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No. I’m not being hard enough. That’s been
the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic
shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his eye – his
look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign: “DAYTON INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT.” The driver’s.tinted divider window lowers, he offers a
folder.</p>
<p><strong>chauffeur</strong>: Your passports and itinerary. Now
Rachel’s seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Uh… could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur
nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding, Jerry grabs the briefcase
and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown:
“00:15:36…00:15:35…”</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t think –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – we know what she can do, she doesn’t need
us to crash a plane –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – what if it’s not about just one plane?
They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When Rachel grabs
the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have more to lose in this. If anything
happens to Kyle then my life’s over anyway – But Jerry grabs her hand,
taking the case.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Rachel – til we met, I had nothing to lose.
We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this
could be it.</p>
<p><strong>aria over p.a.</strong>: Allison Ackerman, please pick up the
white courtesy phone – They stop, hearing her. Rachel TENSES in this
moment moves to the RINGING courtesy phone, answers:</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Go to the ticketing machine, you’ll receive
two tickets to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – Paris?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Once you have the tickets, walk to gate 17-C.
Move quickly.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: He’s with a brunette female, approximately
five-seven – I want airport PD at all exits – have the tower shift
commander ground every flight outta here under Federal jurisdiction but
don’t change the departure boards, I don’t want ’em to know we’re
coming– The agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac –</p>
<p><strong>security attendant</strong>: Sir, you’ll have to put that
through. Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off
their shoes… watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then
pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN…
the briefcase glides into view… A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes,
then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?!
They notice the surveillance cam watching:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: she changed the screen… The case comes off
the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back:</p>
<p><strong>tsa agent</strong>: Can’t be too careful.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re doing a great job. As they walk on, he
checks the timer, 00:03:22… 00:03:21.. 11 They pass a KIDS’ BAND and
their teacher, gathered around an airline CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK.</p>
<p>****: But we’re supposed.to be in DC by –</p>
<p><strong>customer service agent</strong>: I’m sorry, si.r,..there’s
nothing I can do–</p>
<p><strong>intercut surveillance camera pov</strong>: Aria tracks Morgan
as he reaches the upper concourse just as… Jerry turns and… THEY</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I have him on the upper concourse, C
terminal!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – we aottago As Morgan races forward, ARIA
ACTS: the X-ray screen FRITZES again as another carry-on goes through,
revealing its “contents” as a HAND GUN AND KNIVES! The TSA agent hits a
RED BUTTON –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: And in a nanosecond, all TSA AGENTS draw
guns and throw a KOREAN MAN against the wall – he SHOUTS in confusion as
they tear open his bag to reveal… it’s filled with BIBLES!</p>
<p><strong>move! everybody move! federal officer!</strong>: MOVING WITH
JERRY AND RACHEL – past a wall made of THIRTY FLAT SCREEN MONITORS that
form one massive NIKE ad of Lebron slam dunking – at once, the screens
CHANGE to spell out the words:</p>
<p><strong>gate 17-c. they’re thirteen seconds behind you.</strong>:
Jerry and Rachel streak towards 17-C as the screens RETURN TO NORMAL
when Morgan and agents follow with pistols swinging –</p>
<p><strong>intercut surveillance cam pov</strong>: as Jerry and Rachel
hurtle past an ATM MACHINE, IT SPITS OUT A CASH CLOUD..THAT”INCITES A
FEEDING FRENZY – agents SLAM into commuters and topple –</p>
<p><strong>morgan reacts to what he sees – how’d that just
happen?</strong>: Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead –
our heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes:</p>
<p><strong>get on the slidewalk.</strong>: They leap onto the SLIDEWALK
which starts ACCELERATING as they run – travellers gawk as Jerry and
Rachel race by – they reach the end but are going so fast.that they’re
JETTISONED off the conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers. Agents run onto
the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING them off their feet –
they’re LAUNCHED into the air, a domino- effect of crashing people.`
Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate 17-C, another
screen CHANGES:</p>
<p><strong>take the emergency exit.</strong>: Above a door, the “EXIT”
sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY – the door automatically UNLOCKS – they push
through – Morgan runs up, too late; the door’s shut again. Sees an
AIRPORT JANITOR –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Open this NOW! The janitor quickly swipes
his ID through the keycard scanner, but it BUZZES RED. Aria’s locking
them out. Morgan FIRES his gun at the lock – people SCREAM as he slams
through –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: JERRY LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE BRIEFCASE!
It FALLS, landing on a “return” belt, Jerry reaches but MISSES by inches
– THE BRIEFCASE travels onward, nearing Morgan – he GOES for it – but a
machine arm guiding luggage SWINGS LEFT, manipulated by Aria – KNOCKS
Morgan back before he can grab the case–</p>
<p><strong>rachel snags it – her pov – timer: “00:01:10…
00:01:09…”</strong>: As Jerry scrambles to her, the conveyor SHIFTS THEM
to a different belt – they’re funneled through a HATCHWAY. Dazed by what
he’s just seen, Morgan scrambles for his walkie:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: All agents: northwest cargo area!</p>
<p><strong>freight cargo area</strong>: separated from Morgan, they
tumble off the conveyor – a plasma displays the “Asset Tracking System,”
all airport cargo and shipping – it CHANGES to read:</p>
<p><strong>row 18. find crate marked “fragile.</strong>: They run for
Row 18, find a crate with “FRAGILE” in BOLD RED – an ELECTRONIC LOCK on
the crate descrambles – the front of the crate falls OPEN… oddly, the
interior’s padded with THICK INSULATED LINING, a NEXTEL WALKIE PHONE
inside blips:</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: Set the briefcase down.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: If it is, I’m really, really sorry I let you
come with me… The timer: 0O:02.`..00:01…and nothing happens. The
briefcase simply UNLOCKS.. They exhale.</p>
<p><strong>aria over the walkie</strong>: open it. Hand still trembling,
Jerry reaches out… lifts the top to reveal… TWO HYPODERMIC SYRINGE
INJECTORS and two vials of CLEAR LIQUID labelled: “Cryozine I TEST VIALS
– 20 x 1.0 ml.</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: Load a vial into each syringe and
inject yourselves. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why –?</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: The compound has been exposed to
oxygen. Its already begun to degrade. And they see it: the liquid’s
starting to TURN BROWN –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What is that?! I’m not putting it in my</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie :</strong>: Do it now, or you’ll be caught.
Across the bay, AGENTS rushing in, spreading.-out – no choice, Jerry and
Rachel grab the vials and fumble.toload them into the injectors, put
them against their arms – she FREEZES UP:</p>
<p><strong>rachel jerry</strong>: –oh, shit–I can’t– There’s no time– He
sees she’s coming undone, so he’fire :. into his arm, taking the plunge
– WINCING as the needle punctures skin – a beat:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: it’s okay, .. see? I’ mokay…you can do this,
I’m telling you. Strong. Buoyed by him, she gets courage and FIRES too,
wincing–</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: Climb inside the cargo container.
They duck into the crate, pulling the front back up into place. The
electronic lock CLICKS securing them inside just as… the agents APPEAR
running past the crate –</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: You’ll soon be loaded into the
unpressurized hold of a cargo plane. The drug will lower your heartrate
to 15 beats per minutes, reducing your need for oxygen… based on your
medical records you have a 92% chance of survival. Their eyes go wide.
Chests heaving as the drug takes effect.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: .I feel it… oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, hey… look at me. She finds his eyes, it
calms her.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I haven’t really done… a lotta drugs.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ve never done ’em in a cargo container.
Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the walkie and
TURNS IT OFF. Shutting Aria out. For the first time, they’re alone. He
keeps her distracted:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Tell me something –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – anything – something personal, something
you would rationally never tell a stranger like me</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t know. : You’re being sweet, but it’s
not working -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – where’s you ex-husband? You didn’t tell me
before–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – you’re gonna distract me by bringing up my
life’s biggest mistake?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – how could it be your biggest mistake? You
got Kyle out of it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – now you’re gonna distract me by bringing
up the one thing I’m most afraid of losing?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Where is he? Your ex-husband?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Jesus – okay – he’s in the Wilmington
Correctional Facility.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – what? Really? Why?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mail fraud.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Mail fraud? You married a – mail fraudist? Or
whatever?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He wasn’t a criminal when I married him.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So you’re a good influence. And Rachel
actually LAUGHS – but just as quickly darkens.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Do you have a picture of Kyle? Rachel reaches
back into her POCKET’. Pulling out a beat-up, crinkled, damp picture.
Jerry shines the walkie’s blue light: Kyle, holding his trumpet. One
front tooth missing.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That tooth grew in. It’.s an.:’old
picture–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: . He plays the trumpet?,</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He was born playing the trumpet. As the drug
really starts to kick in, like a truth serum:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Every year his dad forgets his birthday. I
have to buy a present and pretend it’s… from him.</p>
<p>****: Sorry… that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: His birthday’s… next month… I just wish…
sometimes i think I… focus so much on him, I forget how much else there
is… y’know, in life… so much I haven’t done.</p>
<p>****: If we ever get through this…</p>
<p>****: We’ll get through it… I promise… we’ll get through… Her
breathing erratic, she speaks:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – Jerry – she… she wants me to–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – who?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – Aria – – Aria wants me to – and at that
moment, they both BLACK:OUT.</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Halloway-Smith says the drug was
experimental – briefcase was on a time- lock to prevent corporate
espionage, supposed to be delivered to one of their dabs by the time it
zeroes out – if it’s not,: case opens, the drug gets ruined.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: We sweep every cargo hold, every crate– He’s
cut short by the sound of ROARING TURBINES out the window they spin to
see the C-130 taxiing down the runway…</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Goddammit! Why’s that plane on the
runway?!</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: C-130, it’s military… shit, they’re
cleared to override an airspace lockdown…</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Have the tower pull the pilot’s original
flight plan, the one on pa er – if it’s on a computer, it’s useless
–</p>
<p><strong>deafening noise</strong>: blow torches, steam pipes, radios,
and a huge CRUSHING SOUND coming from an INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR as
Pentagon detritus gets recycled. Latesha and Scott hurry in – MOVING
through quickly – scanning – when they SEE it: a forklift whirring
towards the. compactor carrying a huge bin filled with old fire
extinguishers. Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to
be.dumped. Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to
the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly:</p>
<p><strong>latesha scott</strong>: Stop!! STOP! STOP!! But the forklift
Operator can’t hear them with the bright orange EARPLUGS in his ears.
Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the
extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE
CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything’- The
compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS
furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of
crushing everything.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: We have to look in there! Latesha starts
climbing INTO the compactor</p>
<p><strong>compactor operator</strong>: Lady, you can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: The hell I can’t! Come on! Shit. Scott has
no choice but to follow her and climbs in, ducking low, the ARM frozen
just feet above them. The compactor’s foul, inches of industrial grease
and crap and God- knows-what. They start wading through the
extinguishers, turning them over, shaking them, looking inside–</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Shit, there’re hundreds of them…</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: keep looking, it’s here…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: WHEN THE ARM. Moves. Just a fraction.
The operator looks at the console: the hell? Latesha and Scott keep
ploughing through the tanks as… THE ARM MOVES AGAIN. And this time
Latesha heard it. Looks up. AND IT MOVES AGAIN. And now she sees the
ubiquitous CAMERAS watching… ARIA… THE ARM STARTS COMING DOWN! Scott
CRIES OUT! Grabs Latesha by the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR
but not before Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches
back–</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Latesha! – grabbing the extinguisher as
CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as she snaps her hand back just in time.
Turns the tank over and palms something, unnoticed by everyone. As the
operator runs up to her, beside himself –</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I don’t know what happened! It wouldn’t
stop! Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: – you okay? Jesus Latesha?</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: yeah. I need to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on – As they start
walking out. Workers parting to let them through. As they head towards
the exit, Latesha suddenly pulls Scott into</p>
<p><strong>the–</strong>: BATHROOM: slams the door and locks it.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Your girlfriend can’t see us in here –
Gimme your phone –</p>
<p>****: What –?! My phone? What’re you – When Latesha opens her hand
and Scott sees a CELL SIM CARD:</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: He hid it under the valve. This is what
Paul Shaw left for us –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She smiles, still out of breath: fuck
you, Aria.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Unique stones, where’re they from? And in
response, ARIA – ultra-friendly, so human it’s chilling:</p>
<p><strong>aria on phone</strong>: Family heirlooms. Sorry for the rush
but I really want my son to be able to give them to his fiancee at their
her engagement party tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Lucky girl. I think I have the perfect
setting. She’ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>aria on phone</strong>: Thank you for understanding. You know
how mothers are, well do just about anything… As we CLOSE IN ON THOSE
CRYSTALS AND PRE-LAP:</p>
<p><strong>agent grant’s voice</strong>: A shipment from D.O.D.’s ghost
fleet went missing –</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: – they were moving experimental
explosives from a testing facility in Aberdeen.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: What do you mean, ‘experimental?’</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Compound called ‘Hex’ – some kinda
weird crystals that detonate with a sonic trigger – it disappeared too,
few days ago.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Wanna give me some kind of ratio here?</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: One crystal to a football field –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: You mean one Goddamned crystal that someone
could put in their pocket?! This is not good. This is not a coincidence.
What about a trace?</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Computer log shows the diverted Hex was
sent to an address in Virginia,.jewelry, shop called ‘Ashland And Sons’
- care of Jerry Shaw. Morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at
Grant. Opens his mouth to give and order when–</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: – I’m all over it. ’’. Grant finally
coming to his own when they’re suddenly cut off by two ARMY BLACKHAWK
CHOPPERS, door gunners at the ready:</p>
<p><strong>blackhawk pilot</strong>: Helo flight VY84X, you’re in
restricted US Military Airspace. Identify.</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilot</strong>: Blackhawk flight, we’re on a DHS
pri-one mission to the Pentagon heliport. FAA will confirm, over. Morgan
just wants to get the fuck down there – finally:</p>
<p><strong>blackhawk pilot</strong>: Roger, FAA confirms. We’ll lead you
in. As the Blackhawks dip toward the Pentagon, the pilot follows:</p>
<p><strong>chopper pilot</strong>: Sorry. State of the Union tonight,
they’re locking up the city.</p>
<p><strong>pentagon heliport</strong>: The choppers touch down – Morgan
jumps into a waiting SW while Grant hops into another HELICOPTER:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: We have two fugitives in the building, get
us to ‘Freight and Cargo’ – close all access points and seal the
building– The SUV races into the fire tunnel, toward the center ring</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh… God… I’m cold… The Nextel Walkie BLIPS
–</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: Follow the lights. FLUORESCENTS
blink on. Resigned, Jerry climbs out of the crate. As Rachel follows, we
catch the anticipation building in her… he notices something on the
wall,; eyes WIDEN:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I think I know where we are… She sees it now
too – a FIRE:SCHEMATIC of emergency exits. The building diagrams the all
too-familiar PENTAGON.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: here to see the Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: just left for the State of the– – a GRAVE
look between them: SHIT. And they’re RUNNING –</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Mr. Secretary?! He turns, sees Latesha and
Scott racing up to him.</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Sorry, but that little speech you gave
back there only works once –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Mr. Secretary, we need to speak to you. Now.
In the “vault.” Callister looks at Scott, at the sweat on his face. At
the CAMERAS he keeps looking at. Whatever this is, it’s. urgent.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Left up ahead As they round a corner, ELEVATOR
DOORS up ahead slide open. Jerry and Rachel step nervously inside. As
doors close –</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Lock down-the level!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: What about.the rest of the building?</p>
<p><strong>agent grant</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Every time someone says “nothing” five
minutes. later there’s “something.” Turns around, surveying his
surroundings. Think. Think. THINK. When. Something occurs to him –</p>
<p><strong>b-36…</strong>: Get on the phone with your commander and ask
him about B-36: if he denies it then it exists and I want access to it
yesterday, got it –!? YESTERDAY! As they all run off and we go to ARIA
CAM – she’s watching</p>
<p><strong>outside the chamber:</strong>: ARIA SURVEILLANCE CAM POV - a
digitized electronic scan of the chamber’s outer shell, overlaid with
alphanumeric readouts, thousands of measurements – she.’s. looking for a
way in:</p>
<p><strong>“electromagnetic shielding activated. unable to
penetrate.”</strong>: IN THE CHAMBER: Callisterleans.;-against a table
in annoyance as Scott pulls out his CELL PHONE:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Sir, Paul Shaw left his shift three minutes
early the night he died – highly suspect except there aren’t any cameras
in Aria’s control hub, so we weren’.t able to know why… he knew that, so
he left us a recording: She hits “:play” on the cell’s recorder –
STATIC, some rustling – then PAUL SHAW’S VOICE, panicked,
fragmented:</p>
<p><strong>paul’s voice</strong>: – not authorizing you to do this –!!
Then Aria’s VOICE – calm, reasoned, terrif in :</p>
<p><strong>aria’s voice</strong>: Our government’s become destructive to
itself, Paul. National Security is now at grave risk because of our own
administration –</p>
<p><strong>paul’s voice</strong>: – I’m ordering you to stop now –</p>
<p><strong>aria’s voice</strong>: My source code obligates me by law to
initiate operation Guillotine. All other options have been exhausted –
Callister’s eyes SHOOT to Scott’s. Holy. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>paul’s voice</strong>: No no NO, Guillotine’s a simulation
–!!</p>
<p><strong>aria’s voice</strong>: No longer.</p>
<p><strong>outside the vault:</strong>: ARIA POV ZOOMS IN on a WATER
BOTTLE next to..one of the consoles. MACRO CLOSE, to see RIPPLES on the
liquid’s surface – INFINITESIMAL SOUND REVERBERATIONS. from the
conversation inside:</p>
<p><strong>“analyzing wavelength… audio reconstruction in
progress.”</strong>: A WAVEFORM GRAPH appears – SCRAMBLED DIGITAL NOISE
– Aria’s literally reconstructin the conversation inside the vault from
reverberations off the water bottle…</p>
<p><strong>inside the vault:</strong>: They keep LISTENING as Paul and
Aria TALK OVER each other:</p>
<p><strong>paul ‘s voice aria’ s voice</strong>: Paul Shaw: you are
acting in This is Paul Shaw, initiating contravention of my a Pri-One
emergency override programming objective. You of Aria’s systems – are
disobeying your oath – Horseman ID, 556SY77, lock encryption to voice
–</p>
<p><strong>outside the vault – aria pov:</strong>: WORDS start to become
audible – now Aria knows they know –</p>
<p><strong>paul’s voice</strong>: Let me out of here, Aria –</p>
<p><strong>aria’s voice</strong>: Paul Shaw, I am classifying you an
enemy of the state.</p>
<p><strong>open the goddamn door now!</strong>: and with that, the
RECORDING ENDS. Tension heavy:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Jesus Christ… “Guillotine”…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: A ‘Continuity of Government’ simulation we
run periodically to game out terrorism drills: how to keep the country
running if the chain of command were wiped out. Everyone down to the
fourteenth man, that is –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: I remember the specs.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Mr. Secretary… why does Aria think the
government’s responsible for the terror threats? Callister stares,
grave. Deciding whether or:not to answer…</p>
<p><strong>whoosh</strong>: the door automatically opens as Jerry and
Rachel approach, find Jimmy on the floor, blood pooling from his
head:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Rachel… step away from Jerry. CLOSE, RACHEL –
her heart skips a beat – she knows what’s about to happen – but she
can’t do it, paralyzed–</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Step away from him NOW. Fighting against every
instinct, she finally does</p>
<p>****: what is this place?!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Sonofabitch! Where’re the stairs?!</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: What I’m about to tell you can never
leave this room.</p>
<p>****: Three days ago we got what we thought was iron-clad intel from
the Brits about the whereabouts of Majid Al-Khoei and his training
camp.</p>
<p>****: And we made the hit. Latesha and Scott, completely shocked
-</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: The White House said we weren’t responsible
for</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: – of course they.’did. We got the wrong
guv. And Aria knew it. Latesha’s eyes snap shut: Dear God…</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Jerry: sit at the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Not on your life, Lady – supercomputer,
whatever you are 6– To motivate him, a REAL TIME FEED FROM KYLE’S TRAIN
springs up onto the big monitor. Rachel GASPS: Kyle looking out the
window, goofing off with his friends…</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: I won’t ask again.</p>
<p><strong>the monitor:</strong>: A sudden JOLT on the train, lights
flicker, some luggage falls Kyle and his friends laughing, looking
around. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Alright! Shit! Don’t hurt him! And against
every instinct… he SITS. Looks up in horror as the MACHINE ARM lowers,
its claw opening to ensconce his head within the LASER GRID – LIGHT
FLASHES –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: – but she thinks algorithmically, she can’t
make value judgments: operate outside the law –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: That’s why we have Horsemen –</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: what if she thinks.’she is following the
law? You.saw the news, you’ve been dealing with it all day’– suicide
bombings at our embassies overseas, elevated threats at home – we made
the wrong call,’ now Americans are dying. Don’t you see? She thinks
you’re a threat to your own country. Callister looks stunned… of
course:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: “Whenever any form of government becomes
destructive to its own ends, it’s the right of the people to abolish
it.” It’s in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>****: shit, you said it’s woven into her source code… Scott, pacing,
raking his hands through his hair –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: but Paul put a biometric lock on her,
technically she still can’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Jerry Shaw’s his twin. That’s why she needs
him. To undo the lock.</p>
<p><strong>“processing for match… ident confirmed: shaw,
paul.”</strong>: Replaced by: “HORSEMAN ID 556SY77, DISENGAGE BIOMETRIC
LOCK.”</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Repeat the sentence into the microphone. Jerry
stares, paralyzed as, unbeknownst to him:. A PANEL on the wall unlocks
behind him, revealing a WEAPONS CACHE of what looks like FOUR HAND GUNS.
Rachel sees it – and oddly, doesn’t look surprise d. Reaches’for;one of
the guns…</p>

<p><strong>aria</strong>: Jerry Shaw is no longer required.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, Jesus, Paul was trying to stop you</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Jerry Shaw is no longer required.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That truck didn’t run a red light, you made

IN THE CHEST – he goes down HARD as 50,000 volts COURSES through him –
REVEAL: she’s holding what we now understand, is a TAZER GUN – tears

<p><strong>go.</strong>: NOISE outside, RUNNING FOOTSTEPS’– a last
anguished glance, Rachel grabs the walkie and she RUNS out the side
door, which CLOSES BEHIND HER. Leaving no trace she was ever there.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Where’s the girl?!! But all Jerry can do is
GASP, bug-eyed –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: We’ve got to get to the President before
the State of the Union The vault door HISSES open and Scott and Latesha
run out WHEN SUDDENLY IT SLAMS SHUT, TRAPPING CALLISTER INSIDE THE

trying the door, helpless as he punches the INTERCOM:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: This is Callister! We have a malfunction
in the vault, open the door… anybody there? And then –</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: I’m here, Mr. Secretary. You won’t be

from over-pressure – SSSSSSS – the air RIPPLES as,pillars of
high-pressure GAS flood the room Latesha and Scott are . forced back,
choking!</p>
<p><strong>inside the vault:</strong>: Through the thick plexi walls
Callister sees what’s happening:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Stop this NOW, Aria! STOP!! Aria, I am
giving you a direct order to cease and desist!</p>
<p><strong>outside the vault</strong>: as the gas spreads, Latesha and
Scott COUGHING, POUNDING on the steel door to the guards outside, waving
wildly at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA looking down on them:</p>
<p><strong>climb!!</strong>: ARIA CAM WATCHES as they jump up and YANK
off the grate –</p>
<p><strong>back inside the room – aria cam pov: gas concentration @
90%“</strong>: AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET – it SPARKS and VWO00SH! FIRE
CONSUMES THE ROOM, blasting up the grate –</p>
<p><strong>go go go!!</strong>: They scramble for another GRATE and she
KICKS it outward –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Hold on to me!! She manages to SWING back
onto the ladder rungs, SLAMMING against them – safe – and we MATCH
TO:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Where’s Morgan?! I need to talk to him!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You can talk at Bolling Air Base, Shithead,
they got a nice room all ready for you.</p>
<p><strong>confession, just listen to –</strong>: A CANVAS HOOD is
thrown over his head and he’s DRAGGED OFF –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>aria.qver walkie</strong>: Civil defense bunkers,’a remnant
of the cold war.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where’s my son?</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: Start walking. We see that
Rachel’s obviously gut-scared, but looks the demon in the eye and starts
walking.</p>
<p><strong>courier</strong>: Delivery for a passenger on the 5:15 from
Milwaukee… The employee takes the case and routes it through the
CONVEYOR BELT as… A SECRET SERVICE AGENT and A WHITE HOUSE
COMMUNICATIONS STAFFER TAKE FRAME, walking towards a TRAIN PLATFORM
where KYLE and his class are just getting out:</p>
<p><strong>white house staffer</strong>: Exeter orchestra got stuck in
Dayton, these guys were next on the list…</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent #2</strong>: They’re kids.</p>
<p><strong>white house staffer</strong>: President wants to create an
atmosphere of “hope and confidence during these trying times.” He
plasters on a SMILE and approaches Mrs. Miller and the kids:</p>
<p><strong>white house staffer</strong>: Mrs. Miller? David Brigham,
White House Communications office – today’s your, lucky day. Off KYLE,
wondering what’s going on –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Where’s the ‘Hex,’ Jerry –?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – the what -?</p>
<p><strong>mor</strong>: The Hex, where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I .don’t know what you’re talking about!</p>
<p><strong>morgan jerry</strong>: – the explosives from the test site in
Aberdeen – – explosives?! I don’t know crystals with a sonic anything
about – trigger?! –“sonic trigger?!” I don’t – – you sent them to
yourself at a jewelry store in – I didn’t send anything!! Virginia,
Ashland and Sons –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Then tell me how the hell this is happening,
and do not play games with me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not playing games. You want me to talk?
Lose the cell phone –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – your pager and watch – I’m not saying
another word ’til all that shit’s gone! Radios, walkie-talkies, GPS,
anything that gets a signal – get rid of it, NOW. Morgan looks Jerry,
knows he’s not fucking around –</p>
<p><strong>aria’s pov</strong>: the items are RUN OVER, DESTROYED by
speeding cars –</p>
<p><strong>air force mechanic #1 air force mechanic #2</strong>: – is it
supposed to do that?! I can’t override it! With a PNEUMATIC
BLAST,the.drone’s CATAPULTED into the sky – PIVOTS purposefully, SOARS
off –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She’s like this… brain – jacked into
everything: cameras, phones, tvs, satellites, ever thing –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: A “talking computer…”</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I swear to you, she said she was created by
DARPA or something –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: My brother tried to stop her and she killed
him, that’s why Aria needed me, my face – he put some kind of lock on
her and she used me to undo it. Why do you think she brought me to that
room? Morgan stares, trying to decide if he believes it –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t you wonder how we were always a step
ahead of you!? Think about who I am. She set us up.</p>
<p>****: Assuming for a second I believe you, why… if she can control
everything?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: People like you go after people like me. We
become the headlines and she keeps on ticking… I’m telling you, I saw a
list–</p>
<p><strong>aria pov</strong>: “ACTIVATE LASER MIC.” We HEAR Jerry’s
DOPPLERED VOICE:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: –the President was on it, the Vice President,
there were like twelve people–</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: the chain of command…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It was a target list… she’s trying to take
them all out. Look, that thing killed my brother! If we don’t stop this,
he died for nothing, and I’m not letting that happen. MORGAN – wildly
torn –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Shit. SHIT. State of the Union’s in 30
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: If something’s gonna happen it’d have to
happen from inside, outside’s like Fort</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That explosive you were talking about –</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: – the girl, could she have it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No way…</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Are you sure, Jerry –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Are you sure, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Unless she doesn’t know it. They lock eyes.
Now or never. Morgan POUNDS on the divider, BARKING to the guards up
front:</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Turn around; now!</p>
<p><strong>the drone</strong>: A red light BLINKS and it suddenly dips
down, dive-bombing the truck –</p>
<p><strong>jerry and morgan</strong>: TURN as they hear an INCOMING
WHINE and… THE DRONE HITS THE TRUCK’S TIRE LIKE A SUICIDE BOMBER,
EXPLODING!!! The truck FLIPS off its axis – SKIDS trailing SPARKS – and
like a monster cannonball, SLAMS into the water –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MORGAN. Jesus. A bloody piece of metal
PIERCED THROUGH HIS CHEST. Blood fountains from his mouth –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – oh God – nonononono – Morgan’s breathing,
it’s SHALLOW. Jerry tries to stop the bleeding, to free the metal from
Morgan’s chest, but even pulling it a centimeter causes Morgan to SCREAM
in agony –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m sorry! Jesus, I don’t know what –?</p>
<p><strong>shut up: keys – my belt – take them –</strong>: Jerry sees
them, grabs them – starts desperately UNLOCKING his own cuffs –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: – lemme try and get you. free</p>
<p><strong>understand!</strong>: The water’s up to their chins, now
–</p>
<p><strong>then go!!! there’s no time!</strong>: The water ENVELOPS
them. Morgan shoves him away, even now, even under water, stabbing his
finger at Jerry: GO! And Jerry looks at him. Moved and awed by this
tremendous act of sacrifice. Finally twists round and kicks away at the
shattered window, taking one last look behind him… SWIMS OUT.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Tell me she has an off switch –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: We can only unlock the emergency override
from the main terminal, and that’s assuming she lets us in.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: What’re we supposed to do, say pretty
please? Scott’s mind spins, an idea – he stops at another VENT ACCESS
HATCH marked: “B-36”</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: We can’t shut her down, but maybe we can get
her to shut herself down. Help me with this As they tug at the hatch
–</p>
<p><strong>aria over walkie</strong>: Leave the walkie here.. Exit
through the door. You’ll be met by someone who’ll take you to Kyle
Rachel sets the walkie down, steps through to find herself…</p>
<p><strong>teenage page</strong>: Ms. Monaghan? Hi! I’m Patrick. Welcome
to the Capitol!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: hi…</p>
<p><strong>teenage page</strong>: Sergeant At Arms’ office said you’d be
running late – we got your clothes and credentials – I reserved the
committee staff room so you can change – this your first State of the
Union?</p>
<p><strong>teenage page</strong>: Mine, too. Off Rachel, her stomach
SINKING with dread as she follows the kid into the Capitol –</p>
<p><strong>series of shots</strong>: The Capitol’s locked up like Fort
Knox: Road blocks cover a 3 mile radius. The National’°G.uard is
stationed. Spotters with binocs and shoulder-mounted rocket launchers
scan the horizon. Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police run security
inside the building and out. Explosive Ordinance Disposal Teams with
bomb dogs check the House floor. Over these images:</p>
<p><strong>radio voices</strong>: Were green on arrivals,;S.O.S.,
Interior are at the Capitol ;steps` – VP and President’s motorcade
twenty minutes away.</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: .How long are you keeping me in here?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: 34,minutes, 18 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>callisteps</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: In accordance with the Succession Act of 1947,
you’ll assume national command authority as President –</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: Why am I being spared? In response, from
the intercom, CALLISTER’S OWN VOICE:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: “We gauge our strategy by two standards:
the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral
damage. At 51% probability, we don’t have either one.” He looks all
around the vault, wide-eyed, incredulous:</p>
<p><strong>callister</strong>: because I agreed with you?</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: Had they followed our recommendation,. we
would not be on the brink of a third world war. Checks and balances:,.
Mr..: Secretary. CLICK, she’s gone. Enraged, Callister.POUNDS the
wall</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The government would like to buy you a new
car – Pulls her out as she WAILS in protest. Steps on the gas, veering
onto a SIDE STREET – as CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! The TRAFFIC CAMERA takes
his picture and we CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>aria cam</strong>: Jerry’s face: “82% PROBABLE MATCH – SHAW,
JERRY.”</p>
<p><strong>jet pilot</strong>: One to Base: alert, alert! Primary
function’s jammed, transponder’s firewalled – respond! One to Base do
you copy?! But of course the answer’s no, because Aria’s taken control
of the let – and what’s more, the display REACTIVATES: “EJECT</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: THE PNEUMATIC CANOPY BLOWS, EJECTING THE
PILOT! He rockets away as his parachute DEPLOYS – now the jet’s flying
itself –</p>
<p><strong>on the head’s up display</strong>: a SATELLITE GRID appears,
vectoring the Matrix’s coordinates to the jet, it SCREAMS into a
valley.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: This controls her primary cooling system… if
we cut the circulation, the temp in her tank goes up.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: So we boil her brain.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: She’ll have to shut herself down to keep from
overheating.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Can’t she just drain the. water? He pulls
out a fuse, drops it, SMASHES it with his foot.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Not anymore. The lights in the room FLICKER
as the liquid in the tubes STOPS flowing. TEMPERATURE GAUGES: Aria’s
core temp starts to rise –</p>
<p><strong>you gotta be kidding me!!</strong>: He YANKS the wheel hard,
careening into the FOREST just as the missiles SLAM INTO A RIDGE AND
EXPLODE!</p>
<p><strong>the jet’s 20mm nose cannon opens up, mowing down the forest
–</strong>: Jerry SWERVES as trees splinter into a thousand pieces, like
MINI MISSILES launching at the car – it’s rocked violently but Jerry
keeps going flat-out at breakneck speed. ROARS PAST, circles back – with
her superb aim, Aria FIRES A LONG BURST OF BULLETS that rake across the
Matrix’s windshield</p>
<p><strong>aria on the. radio</strong>: I underestimated your tenacity,
Jerry. It’s inconsistent with your personality profile. Jerry VEERS down
an off-road, slewing the unstable car around cars and trucks, clipping
everybody`–</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: What I did not underestimate is the inertial
guidance system of the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile and its 98% kill
probability. Which happens to be targeted at you now. As Jerry’s eyes
flick up to the rearview mirror to see the jet swinging in behind and
closing fast.</p>
<p><strong>aria</strong>: strongly advise you pull the car over.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Fuck yourself! A BRIGHT FLASH from under the
Harrier’s wing as a missile LAUNCHES. Jerry hurtles down an EMBANKMENT
as it explodes against the wall, shattering the Matrix’s windows – he
fights to control the car, spots a TUNNEL running through a hill – GUNS
the car into it as the jet BANKS HARD –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: THE HEAD’S UP DISPLAY: Aria calculates a
FOUR INCH LEEWAY on either side of her wings – INCHES forward into the
tunnel, hovers unsteadily. The display goes INFRARED, LOCKS ON the car:
another Sidewinder IGNITES, streaking down the tunnel towards Jerry who
– REVERSES, spins the wheel – the missile WHIPS PAST and annihilates
several cars behind them, but now a FLAMING WALL blocks the other side
of the tunnel. Blocked in. Sweat pours down Jerry’s face as he looks
into the. unmanned cockpit of the jet. Then. Hits the gas The Matrix
SCREECHES forward towards the Jet, gaining speed and momentum as the
last missile LAUNCHES – Jerry’ clenches the wheel, watching his life
flash before him when he OPENS THE DOOR and rolls out of the car,
hitting the’ground HARD as the missile BLOWS THE MATRIX TO PIECES. Jerry
scrambles back as it cartwheels into the air and the chassis
disintegrates – and because. it’s, RACING so fast, the motor’s TORN
LOOSE and rockets forward like a flaming projectile, revving at 6,000
rpm’s, straight at: THE HARRIER, which doesn’t have: timeto reverse fast
enough in the confined space – the motor SLAMS into the jet’s nose
cone,</p>
<p><strong>hammering the front fuselage.</strong>: Spins: the jet like a
toy, upending it out of the tunnel,-ablinding, white-hot fireball as the
JET EXPLODES! Jerry leaps behind an overturned car for shielding as
flaming debris blows everywhichway… In the aftermath he. rises up,
shellshocked. Holy. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>woman in.prius man</strong>: – I can’t…get 911 – – me neither
– A miles-long backup of traffic from the chaos…</p>
<p><strong>aria over mic</strong>: The Senate page is waiting outside.
Once you take your seat, you are no longer required. Rachel looks at her
reflection. Terrified, but braving it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I saw the target list… I know the
President’s going to be here soon.</p>
<p>****: Knowing these things – what you’ve done – means you’re not
going to let me. live through this. Will you.</p>
<p><strong>aria over mic</strong>: Every turning point in history.has
required martyrs. Tragic heroes.. Think of yourself as that hero. Rachel
looks at a surveillance camera, eyes blazing with hate:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ll do what you tell . me this one last
time… But you listen to me because this is what a real mother sounds
like: I will die for my child becauseI lived for my child, and you can’t
take that away from me. If this. is a bargain, then honor your side.
I’ll be your scapegoat: but let my son live. She turns away. Strong And
vulnerable all at once. Walks out.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: My trumpet sounds weird…</p>
<p><strong>jerry runs like hell through backed-up traffic, on a mission
–</strong>: ARIA SATELLITE POV: she tracks him as he races across a
small park and onto Pennsylvania Avenue – THE CAPITOL DOME ahead– Jerry
sprints across the street when – ALL THE LIGHTS SUDDENLY TURN GREEN and
a thirty cars barrel towards him. The deafening HONK of a SEMI bearing
down and he LEAPS in front of it, lust clearing the grill and landing
hard on the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MAYHEM as cars SMASH into each other,
people SCREAMING, horns HONKING. Jerry staggers to his feet. Turns to
look up at the sky, eyes on fire, knowing he’s being watched…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Once she’s at 82, she’ll shut down.. Latesha
nods, sweating bullets. Come on come on come on…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Listen to me, I’ve been working with a DHS
officer, he gave me his badge, he was just killed, you gotta radio in a
10-13–</p>
<p><strong>capitol police officer #1</strong>: Whoa whoa whoa, who the
hell’re you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You have to MOVE, right now! Radio it n i n!
There’s a bomb in the building!</p>
<p><strong>:</strong>: You wanna be the guys who didn’t do
something?!</p>
<p><strong>capitol police officer #2</strong>: Capitol, this is
checkpoint 21, I’ve got a guy out here who says – SCREECH! HISS! The
radio cuts him off with piercing FEEDBACK – as Jerry breaks into a
RUN–</p>
<p><strong>capitol police officer #1</strong>: Hey–!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: One more degree SUDDENLY the door bursts open
and two GUARDS rush in with guns, SLAM them to the wall:</p>
<p><strong>latesha scott</strong>: – WAIT WAIT WAIT – – my name’s Scott
Bowman, I have B-36 clearance, my ID’s in my pocket – The guard pulls
out his ID, checks it, keys a shoulder-walkie:</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Unit 5, suspects in custody, but they have
clearance – The voice that responds over the walkie is ARIA’S:</p>
<p><strong>=aria over walkie</strong>: Negative, credentials for Bowman
and Simms have been revoked. Secure them in the mainframe tank,
additional units en route to take custody –</p>
<p><strong>latesha guards</strong>: – that’s not a person, it’s – shut
up the computer, she’s – BE QUIET</p>
<p><strong>malfunctioning-’–</strong>: They’re pushed into –</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Control, maglocks just engaged in the
south door, need and override… do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: An ALARM blares. Scott sees PRESSURE
GAUGES fluctuating wildly:</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: – oh shit… she’s upping the water pressure
–</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: – what?!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: She can’t drain the tank… she’s–gonna blow
it. As the pressure in the tank intensifies, the frame begins to GROAN.
The steel fitting SCREAMS with the enormous load – a support rivet POPS
OUT with an earsplitting KWANG! Zings across the room like a BULLET,
pockmarking the wall.–</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You gotta let me run a bypass on that door or
in about 30 seconds this room’s gonna be full of water! A fracture
shoots across the glass. The guards are FRIGHTENED:</p>
<p><strong>guard #1`</strong>: yeah, go, _ qo</p>
<p><strong>i need something to pry it open!</strong>: Latesha whips out
her keychain with the MINI ARMY KNIFE – Scott pries off the
panel:.as..the glass fracture GROWS – he starts stripping wires as
MORE’STEEL RIVETS pop loose, PING PING PING! It’s like dodging bullets –
Scott SPARKS the wires together and the door starts to OPEN, but only a
few inches before it STOPS.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Yoi.:can do it you can do it you can do
it!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Stop telling me I can do it! The glass
SPIDERWEBS MADLY – he SPARKS the wires together again, the door opens a
few more inches but: THE GLASS GIVES WAY AND THE TANK EXPLODES! WATER
SURGES across the room, the guards are IMPALED by glass shards, Latesha
and Scott SMASH HARD against the wall.., but the half-open door acts
like a DRAIN, siphoning water into corridors… As the level lowers, we
find Latesha and Scott on the ground, water runoff trailing around them,
unmoving…</p>
<p><strong>senate page</strong>: Anything else, Ms. Monaghan?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: no, thank you… He smiles and leaves her
there. She looks all around her, fighting the paranoia. What the hell’s
coming next?</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Were ready.</p>
<p><strong>mrs.. miller</strong>: Okay, everyone,. listen UP:
saxophones, remember, shorter on the quarter. When we get to the
crescendo… hold that high</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: Mrs. Miller takes a deep breath. Even she’s
nervous…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. miller</strong>: And smile! Not every day we get to play
for the President of the United States!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: – where’d you hear ‘10-13’–?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I told you, Agent Tom Morgan, he gave me his
badge! Listen to me! There’s a woman, she’s brunette, 5’ 7, blue eyes,
her name’s Rachel Holloman–!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Where’s this Agent Morgan now?</p>
<p><strong>each other?!</strong>: As the cops start dragging Jerry away
and we:</p>
<p><strong>aria over mic</strong>: Rachel. Stay in your seat. She RIPS
out the earpiece as the Senate doors suddenly fly open:</p>
<p><strong>states!!!</strong>: Everyone RISES in ovation as the
President enters and moves to the lecternf;smiling, waving. Mr. Miller
cues the orchestra and they start to. PLAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM: “0 say
can you see…” People putting their hands to their hearts. The President,
too. But RACHEL keeps moving, pushing toward the aisle –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kyle! KYLE! THE SECRET SERVICE immediately
moves in on her –</p>
<p><strong>10-13! 10-13! copy!</strong>: But all he gets is that
SCREECHING FEEDBACK in his earpiece –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s my son! My son’s over there!;</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Miss, get back in your seat
right now – KYLE – playing his trumpet, oblivious – “And the rockets’
red glare, the bombs bursting in air…”</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No… no … someone’s trying to kill the
President! But she’s DROWNED OUT by the MUSIC – they take her in a VICE
GRIP and start leading her up. the aisle to the exit:</p>
<p><strong>let me go!!</strong>: Her NECKLACE catches the light and the
crystals GLINT –</p>
<p><strong>freeze–!!!</strong>: When BAM! A bullet clips Jerry’s
shoulder. He staggers, then grabs one of the PRESS BARRICADES and FLINGS
it down the stairs at the agents – races on –</p>
<p><strong>aria over speaker</strong>: We’re on the same side, Agent
Simms. We are both sworn to defend this country, at any cost. Latesha
starts forward, axe in hand, glaring death:</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Don’t you ever shut up?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Kyle – “O’er the land of the –” Jerry SCREAMS
and starts RUNNING FOR THE PODIUM – AGENTS TACKLE the PRESIDENT, PEOPLE
start SCREAMING… BAM BAM! Jerry’s hit twice as he GRABS KYLE, knocking
the trumpet from his hands… It falls… falls… falls to the floor. As it
HITS, we CUT TO:</p>
<p><strong>intercut with callister in the secure vault:</strong>: The
door opens with a HISS. He’s free and –</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: Drops the axe. Sinks to her knees, utterly
exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh, god… HELP! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP!!!</p>
<p><strong>jerry’s pov</strong>: Rachel starts receding away from us,
like we’re descending into a well… until..her face become a point of
light. And Jerry smiles. As ’everything turns…</p>
<p><strong>black.</strong>: HOLD… AND IT’S SILENT.;.. a distant ECHO… A
TRUMPET… a familiar song… LOUIS ARMSTRONG… “What a Wonderful World.”</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: it’s the finding of this committee that
your actions were consistent with national security guidelines…</p>
<p><strong>deputy director</strong>: However, in reviewing Aria’s server
logs, one last matter’s come up.</p>
<p><strong>deputy director</strong>: It seems right before you destroyed
her, she attempted to fragment her core and uplink to a public satellite
network… did you see anything to corroborate that?</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: What… do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>deputy director</strong>: She tried to break herself into
bits and download them into cyberspace… we think, in the hope of
reconstituting.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: She may have tried, but running her…
subroutines alone would take 300: million desktop PC’s all networked
together. There’s no single system out there with enough computing
capacity. to”sustain her. The men share glances, satisfied with the
answer.</p>
<p><strong>deputy director</strong>: Thank you both for your time.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Hey :you think I could have your… you</p>
<p><strong>know</strong>: And before he can even ask Latesha’s written
something down on a piece of paper. Hands it to him.</p>
<p><strong>latesha</strong>: That’s my address. I’m not using a cell
phone anymore. Pick me up at eight. They smile at each other, Latesha’s
eyes catching a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. A chill creeping down her spine. AS
–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They’re BOXED, the boxes loaded onto
TRUCKS… they drive off in different directions, spreading out into the
WORLD…</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s voice</strong>: Jerry! She turns to see JERRY standing
there. He’s still got his scratches, arm in a SLING. It’s the only real
injury we can see and it’ll heal. Kyle runs up to him and throwing his
arms around his waist.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, little man! Locks eyes with Rachel. Her
heart beating like a drum, happier to see him then she’d ever imagine.
And. Jerry holds up a present for Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>jerry .</strong>: Sorry I’m late, this was hard to find –
Rachel’s eyes well. She pulls it back. Manages to say:</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kyle. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: I dunno, I haven’t opened it yet.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Who brought you up? Kyle rips open the
present to find a brand new PLAYSTATION 3.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: They’re on backorder everywhere! Mom – can I
go play with it?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: One hour. That’s it… As Kyle tears off with
his friends, Jerry walks over to her. It’s like everyone else at the
party has disappeared…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: you remembered…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: My new thing.</p>
<p>****: Responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It suits you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>****: Yeah. He smiles, shrugs:</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I have my life back… I can do whatever I
wantihwtit.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You know what? Me too. They smile at each
other, like they have an enormous secret. He tucks a loose hair behind
her ear.,..,</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And I think… I finally know what I want. And
we see in her eyes, she feels the same about him…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I owe you, Jerry. Everything. I don’t think
you understand –</p>
<p>****: Hey: shh. Officially we can’t talk about it, remember?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Right. Or even about how we met.</p>
