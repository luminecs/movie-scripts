<h1 id="he-s-just-not-that-into-you">he-s-just-not-that-into-you</h1>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I have a theory about how this all
started…</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Because you smell like dog poo.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: You’re so stupid just like dog poo!
You’re made of poo!</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Made. Of. Dog. Poo.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Honey, do you know why that little boy did
those things? And said those things?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Because he LIKES YOU.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Uh - excuse me – but what - the - HELL? Where
did that rumor start? Because moms have been spreading it for years.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That little boy is doing those terrible things
because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Do you understand what this means? We are all
encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk – that means
he likes you. Sure, that’s a lesson that might serve us as five year
olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Then, as we get older, we carry on this
tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends
to do the same…</p>
<p><strong>roommate #1</strong>: That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.
I’m sure he just lost your number.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He’s not asking you out because he’s
intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity.</p>
<p><strong>cute twentysomething #1</strong>: Here’s the problem. He
likes you TOO much. You’re TOO pretty and awesome. He can’t handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>cashier #1</strong>: Trust me. It’s because he’s just getting
out of a serious relationship.</p>
<p><strong>middle aged woman #1</strong>: Trust me. It’s because he’s
never had a serious relationship.</p>
<p><strong>tokyo girl #1</strong>: Shigeru’s inability to commit clearly
stems from his failure to properly imprint on his mother during breast
feeding.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: I’m sure he forgot your hut number. Or
didn’t get enough approval from his father. Or was eaten by a
giraffe.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Why do we say this stuff to each other? Why do
we tell each other these lies?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Is it possible that it’s because we’re too
scared, and it’s too hard, to say the one obvious truth that’s staring
everyone in the face?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So, Janine told me you’re a real estate
agent.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yeah. But don’t worry - not one of the cheesy
ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So just like on frisbees and notepads?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Much classier.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I wonder why Janine never thought of
introducing us before?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yeah, I don’t know, I ummm -</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You guys ready for another round?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You want one more?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Only if you do. But I mean, if you have to get
going I totally …</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Umm. OK. Sure. One more.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You had Ketel and soda, right?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yeah. It was really nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: B-bye.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hey, it’s me. He’s cute. I think it went
well.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: And I think he might me leaving me a message
at home as - we - speak.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Hey, it’s me…I just wanted you to know that I
was thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Conor, that’s so nice. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you want to go ahead?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Go ahead? You’ve only got two things.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’ve only got one thing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, technically it’s six. And I’m still
mulling over a gum purchase. So…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hey, let me call you right back.</p>
<p><strong>emotionless cashier</strong>: Oh my word.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Come on. Seriously. I just deposited money
today. There’s no way -</p>
<p><strong>emotionless cashier</strong>: It’s not that. Let me check
something.</p>
<p>****: Congratulations. You won.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>emotionless cashier</strong>: Our “Sizzlin’ Summer”
promotion. You’re our 1000th customer in June.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>emotionless cashier</strong>: Do I have that kind of manner?
A joking manner?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I swear to god, this is the most exciting
thing that’s ever happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is that sad?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, it’s - charming. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wait, no. I can’t accept this. You were here
first. I didn’t win at all.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, you did. Trust me - it’s fate. You were
meant to have that cooler.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thank you SO MUCH.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey. How was the date?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Fine. You know.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My cable’s out.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You didn’t hear the phone ring, did you?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Shit. Anna gave me the “I’ll call you right
back.”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: How long ago?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: 22 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sorry, dude.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Do I call back?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I know. I’ll call back and say that I’m going
to bed.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: At 9:30 PM? Genius.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: It is genius. Because then I can say: “In
case you were going to call me back - don’t - ’cause I’ll be
sleeping.”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sounds foolproof.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sorry. What was I saying?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think you were telling me how you don’t want
to be like your mom and wake up and realize you didn’t pursue your
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Was I? Little intense for grocery store
chatter. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s OK. I might even be able to help you out.
There’s a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That would be - amazing. What are you - like
my savior?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: OK. Look. I’m married. I don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Don’t do what? Help struggling singers?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Help hot Pilates instructing singers who happen
to be very charming.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do you want to give me your card? That’s
legit. I bet you’re allowed to do that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right. OK. I guess that would be OK.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So, who was that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A prospective client.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah right.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can talk to a woman Neil. It doesn’t have to
be like that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey, babe. You here?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hey honey.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yeah. Just got off the phone.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You want some tea or something?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It was my baby sister. She’s getting
married.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s great. I’ve always liked that Devon
guy. That’s really great.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Do you think it’s great?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: So, you think it’s great that they’re getting
married, but you never feel like we’re going against nature or something
by not getting married?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No, babe.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Going against nature is like that cat who
started nursing that monkey. We’re just two people who aren’t
married.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I actually think the odds of having a
successful relationship increase by not getting married. Look at my
parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint
checking.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yeah, I know. I get that.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Like I’ve always told you - I love you - and
we don’t need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Lemme get you some tea.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: OK, so clearly he hasn’t called.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Maybe he’s away on business.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He sells real estate. In Baltimore. Staying in
town is his business.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Look, let me tell you - after the first time
I went out with Ben, he didn’t call me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And
now he’s like the world’s best husband. That happens all the time.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Yes, really.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: This is all your fault.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You set me up with him.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave
Conor your number. That’s not a set up. When I do a set up - I weigh
pros and cons. I do my due diligence. All I know about Conor is he sold
us this house.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He sold you a house in the ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s a neighborhood “in transition.”</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Seriously, stop.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He said he always hangs at Red Maple after
work. Maybe I should do a little drive-by?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Please, don’t. He’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>amber</strong>: Caller ID was the worst thing that’s ever
happened to me. Total invasion of my personal freedom. When a guy
doesn’t call me, it is my right - my duty even - to call him and hang up
several thousand times. Or at least until his mother shouts at me in
Albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone. I mean, calling and
hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many
wine coolers - and who is AT&amp; f’ing T to take that away from me?</p>
<p><strong>amber</strong>: Next thing you know, someone is going to ban
me from sitting in my car in front of a guy’s house, blaring “Where Is
Your Heart” by Kelly Clarkson until his new stupid girlfriend comes
outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics. I mean,
a girl deserves freedom of expression, right?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Mom, I gotta call you back.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: So, this was at the end of the date, or at
the beginning?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: End. Why - does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Yeah. “Nice meeting you” at the beginning of
the date is normal. “Nice meeting you” at the end could be a blow
off.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Maybe it was at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Then that’s fine. He’s gonna call.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Or maybe it was at the end. Or maybe it was
nice to meet me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Wait - was it “nice meeting you” or “nice to
meet you”?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Shit. I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: “Nice to meet you” is OK. “Nice meeting you”
is like “Do you want your receipt in the bag?”</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Remember the days when you guys at least
pretended to be working when I came in?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Janine, how’s the press release?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Beckon the baking to begin! McCormick, the
flavor expert, introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely
delight dessert divas!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration - but
otherwise good. Where are we with the company newsletter?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I am so almost done with that. It’s just been
a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in
market research, when the guy - who may or may not be the guy of my
dreams - refuses to call me.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Look, after my first date with Neil, I called
him. There are no rules anymore. Why should you have to wait for him to
get off his ass?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: It’s ringing.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Pretty standard.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Yes! Voicemail.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Your notes.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hey, Conor. It’s Gigi. I just thought, I
hadn’t heard from you and, I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to
wait for a guy’s call anyway, right?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I mean, we’re all equal, right? More than
equal – more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do
better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot
innocent people - - I mean I don’t know if you saw that Dateline - but
women practically have penises now, right? Well, call me. This is Gigi.
Call me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Don’t worry. He’s totally gonna call.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: WHAT? How can there be no dial tone?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Mom? Is that you? I can’t talk now. I’ll call
you back.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Janine. It’s me. Conor never called, so I’m on
the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you
want to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>alright-i’m-interpreting-your-silence-as</strong>:
tacit-compliance-bye.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Knock knock.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: So. Here we are. Same shift again.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I know. I make the schedule.</p>
<p>****: I figured it was no coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: I had fun the other night.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah. It’s amazing where 10 shots of Patron
will get you.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight
after work…we could, you know…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the
other night was - fun. But we’re way understaffed tonight - I even have
to man the bar - and that’s why I scheduled you. To work. So…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Are we good here?</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: No. We’re good.</p>
<p><strong>accidentally shoulder blocks alex. hard.</strong>: He has to
take a step to catch his balance.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Dude.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Are you joining us for dinner or -</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m meeting someone. A guy.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Ugh. Why?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hmmmm?</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m meeting someone.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: I believe you mentioned that.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m gonna wait at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: That’s a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Oh, that’s OK. I’m meeting someone.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, yeah? Got a hot date?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I don’t know if you’d call it hot – I mean
this guy Conor and I have only been out the one time so –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Wait - Conor Barry?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Oh, uhh, yeah –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Conor’s not coming in tonight. Did he forget
he was supposed to meet you?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: See when I said “meeting someone” I guess that
was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word
“meeting”-</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Because I could just call him –</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I mean, I
actually was just - in the area - so I figured I’d just swing by and see
if he was around - because - uhhh —</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I uhh, had to return his –</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Pen. I had to return this - pen. He left this.
So, I thought I should really return it before he - you know - – freaks
out.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric
Dentistry.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Look, I’m not gonna judge about what may or
may not be important to someone.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: That’s not even his dentist.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Oh, really? Then who’s his dentist?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: My dad.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m Gigi. Conor and I went out last week. And
I just…I thought if I ran into him…I don’t know. I’m gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey. Just - hang out for a second. Lemme buy
you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I’m just
gonna be honest - Conor is never going to call you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Oh really? How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Because I’m a guy. It’s how we do it.</p>
<p>****: He said it was nice meeting me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t care if he said you were his favorite
female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by - and
he didn’t call.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: But maybe he called me and I didn’t get the
message. Or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a
cab, or his grandma died.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Or maybe he just didn’t call because he has no
interest in seeing you again.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with
this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a
year later she ran into him –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Your friend Terri’s an idiot. And she’s the
exception.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: OK. But what if I’m the exception?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re not. You’re the rule. And the rule is -
if a guy doesn’t call you, he doesn’t want to call you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Really? Always?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a woman
looks like. I do it early and I do it often. Trust me - if a guy is
treating you like he doesn’t give a shit - - he doesn’t. No
exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Why are you telling me all of this? Aren’t
these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t know. You looked like you could really
use the help.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Thank you. You’ve given me a lot to think
about.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I was up all night.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Please say you were working on the
newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Sure. It’s basically done. But this is
important.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What’s happening with your hair?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Please come in my office before the others see
that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I think I figured it out. Remember when I went
out with that notary public? And he cheated on me? And then Anastasia
from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her
at the beginning - but then he totally changed and they’re married and
crazy in love.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I thought that guy was a process server.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: No, notary. Anyway, the point is - Anastasia
is the exception. Not the rule. We have to stop listening to these
stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front
don’t really care about you very much.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived in his
storage space. He only used me for rides, yet I continued to stalk him
for most of 1998. Then there was Don, who broke up with me every Friday
so he could have his weekends free. I was so delusional about our
relationship that I referred to him as my husband to random people like
my dental hygenist.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: And all my friends would tell me stories about
how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone
who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended
up getting married and living happily ever after. But that’s the
exception. And we’re not the exception - we’re the rule.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: OK. So let me see if I understand. What you’re
saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a
guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her – that’s the
exception. And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls -
like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting
married.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: No. No, no, no. That’s not what I’m saying.
This has absolutely nothing to do with you. I was just talking, you
know, about me. Specifically.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It is impossible not to like this guy. I’m
pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside Eddie’s, and then he
tells me he’s married. You’d think I’d be pissed, but I literally could
not stop myself from liking him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But he’s married.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I realize that. I keep trying to force myself
to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman, and even that
doesn’t cool it off. What is my problem?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: OK. There was this guy who worked in my dad’s
printing business. Married for fifteen years to a nice lady. And then he
meets this woman at some church event. And he told my dad he just had
never felt anything like it before. I mean, he had finally met the love
of his life. So, he divorced his wife, and he’s been with this other
woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy. I mean, what if you
meet the love of your life - but you already married someone else? Are
you supposed to pass them by?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re right. I’m calling him.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, Anna. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, I was just taking you up on your offer.
You said you might know someone who could help me out and I thought we
could discuss it – over coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, I just…I can’t Anna. You seem great. It’s
just - I don’t know. I should go. Take care.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I am so psyched that you called.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I had sort of given up on you when you didn’t
call me back the other night.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, you know. I was just thinking about
you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: OK. Give me the categories again.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: There are four. Sexy, smart, funny or cute.
And each person can only be two. Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and
sexy. Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I love that you are hot for Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So, which am I?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What was I again?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Smart and cute.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: OK. You’re sexy. Very sexy. And cute.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. Cute and sexy are in the looks column. No
one wants to be in all one column.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Well, I sound like a jackass if I say you’re
all four. But you’re so obviously all four. Especially sexy.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I better go.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Oh. OK. I mean, you could just stay here
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What? It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I know. It’s just - I’m fried. Is that
alright?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Sure. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey babe, is this straight?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why are you hanging that?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I told you I’d do it weeks ago. You don’t like
it there?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I love it there. But just - stop.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It’s the image, isn’t it? I didn’t see it
before, but - you’re right - it totally looks like a sagging boob.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You want me to take it down?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. I want you stop doing anything nice.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Is this a trick?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. I need you to stop being nice to me -
unless you’re gonna marry me after.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Is that funny?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No. It was just - I was just–</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: See, you can’t keep being nice to me and I
can’t keep pretending like this is something that it’s not. We’ve been
together over seven years. You know me. You either want to marry me or
you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Or there is the possibility that I just don’t
really believe in the concept of -</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! Bullshit for every woman
who’s been told by some guy that he doesn’t believe in marriage just to
see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year
old girl he met at the gym. Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Honey, where is all this coming from?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: From the place that I have been hiding from
you for the last five years because I didn’t want to seem demanding, or
clingy or psycho or whatever. So I never ask. But now I’m going to —</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Are you ever going to marry me?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I can’t do this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I was with Damon for six years. He asked me to
marry him on the phone, because he’s just so different and cool like
that. Said he’d eventually get me a ring, which he didn’t, but he did
buy himself a ring because isn’t that so hilarious and cool that the guy
is wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part is, I stayed with him even
after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a “relation
vacation.” Isn’t that a cute name? Let me explain the concept: it
involves dating a girl from the time she’s thirty two to the time she’s
thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and
then, after all that, wanting to take a year off. And giving it a fun
name that you can put on t-shirts. I left him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey, Anna. This is Ben. Look, I know it’s been
a little while since you called. I just - it took me by surprise. But I
offered to help you with your career, and I don’t see why I can’t do
that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe you can come by the office this
week or something. Okay, take care. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>to reveal</strong>: JANINE. Gigi’s co-worker. And Ben’s
WIFE.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Hey, how –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shit - you scared me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Is everything OK?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah. Everything’s fine. Why?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Are you smoking again?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, sweetie. Why?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Well - you get jumpy when you smoke.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not smoking. So, why don’t we worry about
what color we’re gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things
that aren’t happening?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I don’t know - I was thinking maybe -
pink?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Pink? Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Well, I mean, at some point.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You sure we’re ready for this now?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No. But I mean, we could paint one room pink
and one blue just in case.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ve already created the perfect family in
this house, and we don’t even have drywall.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I’m sorry. I know I promised we’d wait to
talk about it -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think we’re almost ready to start talking
about it.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I’ve always liked the name Gisele.</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back to
the office.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You go back to the office after happy hour?
What’s happy about that?</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: I met you.</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: So, I’d love to call you sometime. Do you
have a card?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: And here’s my info.</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So, wait – how are we doing this? Are you
hearing from me or am I getting a call?</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You said you’d love to call me, but then you
said “look forward to hearing from you.” See how that’s kinda
confusing?</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: Look - we’ll talk. We’ll get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Ooopsie - you did it again. Very vague. You
know what? Why don’t we just say that you’ll call me, and then we can
skip all the nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Or I guess I could just call you –</p>
<p><strong>jarrad</strong>: Goodbye, Gigi.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He was cute.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Please don’t cyber-stalk him.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Wait - what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m not calling him. If he wants to see me -
he’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Wow, that guy Alex really made an impression
on you. Was he hot?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: No. He was just – right.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He asked me out.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Oh my god! He called?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well -</p>
<p><strong>joshua</strong>: He emailed?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Umm -</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What? Did he travel by carriage and leave his
calling card with your lady in waiting?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He MySpaced me.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>joshua</strong>: I don’t know. My slutty sister says MySpace
is the new booty call.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, what am I supposed to do? Things have
changed. People don’t just meet organically anymore. If I want to make
myself more attractive to the opposite sex, I don’t go get a new haircut
- I update my profile. That’s just how it is.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Back to work.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Ad sales - this is Mary.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Hey, it’s Conor. Anna’s - uh - friend. Or
whatever.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hey. So, did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’m not sure about this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You gotta trust me. It’s a burgeoning market.
You’re gonna make a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you have to
put me on the page with the massage ads?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It was either that or on the page with the
personals. I made a call.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: OK. You’re right. Hey, have you talked to
Anna lately?</p>
<p><strong>the home for your lifestyle - conor barry - real
estate</strong>: Under which is a picture of Conor, standing in front of
a brick Tudor, a SOLD SIGN proudly displayed. In the background - TWO
MEN look lovingly at their new home.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I do not understand how you got mom to
sew all of these in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: She wanted to do it.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Mom told me she felt like an old Indonesian
lady in a sweatshop.</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: No, she didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why again do you need to get married so
fast?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’re so pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: I’m not pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Chug a beer, then. I want to see you chug
a beer.</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: We’re in love, you assholes. That’s what
people do when they’re in love - they get married.</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: Bethie, you know I didn’t mean –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s OK. Neil and I are actually - done -
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us? You should have
told us.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: You have to come over and have dinner with me
and Steven and the kids tonight, OK? You can even stay over if you
want.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Why would she want to hang out with us
and our husbands? Seriously, Beth, isn’t that exactly what you want to
avoid right now?</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: You know what - if being in the wedding is
too painful-</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You guys, it’s cool. I’m fine. So I lost a
little time. Big deal.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: So not a big deal. You’re still really
young.</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: So young.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: Everything you learned in that relationship
is just gonna make the next one so much stronger.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: She wasted so much time.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I knew he was never gonna propose.</p>
<p><strong>paige</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know it’s here somewhere. I spoke to George
Lane in music, and he gave me this whole list of references for you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s cool. You can call me when you find
it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I swear I didn’t lure you here under false
pretenses.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I know. But a girl can dream.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re obviously too good of a guy.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why are you married, again?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Seriously. Why? It’ll be good for me. Tell me
how you decided that you could not be without this other woman.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’d been together since college. She gave me
an ultimatum: we get married or we break up. So, we got married.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Seriously? You just caved?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s complicated.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re a dick if you date a girl for too long,
and don’t marry her. But you marry her, and then you’re an asshole for
marrying her before you’re ready. Shit - I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re really hot and I’m obviously attracted
to you, but I guess the best I can do is eventually find this piece of
paper, and call you, and hope I help in some small way with your career,
and be happy about that.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A TORN BUSINESS CARD, TAPED BACK TOGETHER.
The name on the card is JARRAD MONTROSE. Gigi sits, staring at the card.
She reaches for the phone, and then thinks the better of it. And
again.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hi, this is Gigi.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Gigi?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Gigi Phillips. I had the - umm - dentist
pen.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m really sorry to bug you. I just - I
thought you had some really good insights the other night and – I had a
question.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Okay, maybe I need to be harsh – Conor is
never going to be interested in you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: No, I know. This is about - - Jarrad. You have
a sec?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So I meet him at happy hour and he was
completely charming –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy
about this hour is you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He may have used some derivative of that. So,
he says he’s going to call, but then gave me his card and –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s not interested.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You don’t even know if he called –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Did he?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: No. But the thing is, I honestly think he’s
expecting my call.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He said “Look forward to hearing from you” and
not “Look forward to talking to you.” I mean, do you hear the
connotations?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He. Is. Not. Interested.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Alex - this is jacked. The hostess is giving
me shit for not wearing a white shirt – this shirt is WHITE!</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: This shit is white.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: If a guy gives you his phone number, instead
of taking yours, he’s not interested.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He took mine first, but then he –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And, if a guy wants to see you, he will see
you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell’s until I got the right one.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: That’s cute. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: As it turned out, her ass looked really huge
in daylight.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Is it your sensitivity that makes you so
popular with women?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t call him. He doesn’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Again with the sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Just trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I know. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a
CAKE.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Oh sweetie - you didn’t have to get me
anything.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Mom - you always say that and I always get you
something.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Tim Buckley. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Here - put on my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Did Anna ever tell you I knew Tim Buckley?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: No. She did not.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: We met at a coffee shop in 1971. Hell’s
Kitchen. I had no idea who he was. But he had this big mop of hair and
these eyes that just looked past you and through you and into you all at
the same time. Complete interest and disinterest. It was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Of course, I was with Anna’s father at the
time, so, you know…another opportunity missed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Mom, please -</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: It’s the truth. I knew them all. Robert Plant,
Harry Nilsson, Graham Parsons… Have you seen the pictures of me from
when I was Anna’s age?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Umm - I don’t think so -</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Sweetie go get that picture - you know the one
-</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Go. Your mother’s asking you to do something
for her on her birthday.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: You’ll see - we look strikingly similar. My
lips may be a bit fuller, but…</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: MAYA, in her early twenties. Black and white
- somewhere in New York. The resemblance to Anna is scary.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Wow. That’s - unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: So that’s what we’re dealing with here, for
reference. Imagine meeting someone who looks like that in a coffee
shop.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: That’s funny, because, I mean, I guess I
kinda did. Anna and I met at a restaurant. That serves coffee. So, not a
coffee shop, but…still -</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: That’s sweet. But if we’re comparing stories -
She’s no me - and you’re no Tim Buckley.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Anyone need a refill?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thanks again for coming with me. You make it
so much easier.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Are you kidding? I like your mom. She’s
cool.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeah, well - cool’s not always what you’re
looking for in a mom.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: So, you want another – foot rub?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ugh. I’m just beat. I wanna put on sweats and
get in bed.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’d be into that.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ll call you tomorrow, OK?</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: If a girl is into you, she’s sleeping with
you. And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she’s not
sleeping with you, she does not like you. I guess the trick is, how to
spot this girl early - so you don’t waste the one to seven weeks waiting
to find out that it’s never gonna happen. So, I’ve got some signs about
how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience, of course. A
girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable,
she pops a zit in front of you, her name is Amber or Christine, she
takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3.
I know it’s not scientific - but I’m just saying - you were warned.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey dude - you here?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Wanna beer?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Or an apple martini?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Funny.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Need I ask?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: It’s for work. I’m trying to expand my client
base.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: By pretending you’re gay?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: No. By being more gay friendly.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Or, in real estate terms, by becoming “gay
adjacent”.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Nice. I may have to use that.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’m gonna try something else. This may be too
much.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I don’t know. You dress like that - and you’re
already seeing a girl who won’t sleep with you - I think maybe you can
pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: It’s not that she won’t sleep with me
douchebag…I have slept with her. It’s just, you know, she…um…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Won’t sleep with you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Pretty much, yeah. So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I think you’re gonna have to beat ’em away
with a stick - you hot, sexy man.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Who would have thought that a random girl from
Pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Back at you sister.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I can’t wait to kiss you again.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Umm. We’re kissing right now.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I know. But next time. The second date kiss is
way more intimate.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Well, I’m going out of town tomorrow - so
I’ll be out of touch for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Would you excuse me a quick second? Too many
diet cokes…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hey, sorry to bug you again. Quick
question.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Would you excuse me a second, babe?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m making out with a guy - PG stuff - and
then he mentions he’s going out of town, so he’s gonna be out of
touch.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: But maybe he is going out of town.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: To where? The Arab Emirates? Where is he going
that he has to be out of touch?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Where are you going out of town to again?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So, now what? I’m just supposed to run from
every guy who doesn’t like me?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Uhh - yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: There’s not going to be anyone left.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: OK, I don’t know why I’m saying this - but I
actually think I know a nice guy who you might like.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah. He’s a friend of my brother’s. Bill.
We’ll all meet for a drink - it’ll be good.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So, I’m in his bathroom right now. What do I
now?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You gotta come out eventually. But I’d really
take my time. Let him sweat.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So, we ran into each other.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You came to my class.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t know it was your class.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You called and asked me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But you didn’t call me back.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Because you said not to call back if it was my
class. Which it was.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We ran into each other.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Totally. A couple of innocent folks - by
happenstance - doing their daily workout near one another.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Exactly. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wanna swim?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was just thinking - why can’t we be friends?
Am I not allowed to make friends anymore? Am I not allowed to be friends
with hot people? What kind of reverse prejudice is that?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I hear you. Am I supposed to not be friends
with a guy just because he’s married, and happens to have this insane
smile and this ass that makes me want to dry hump?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think I just fell in love. A girl who talks
about a dry hump.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Classy, right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Classy is lame.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So, friends, right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You wanna come in?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t trust myself.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: OK. You can just watch.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You may be the best friend I’ve ever had.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Honey - you smell different.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Different how?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well that’s an odd thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Maybe it’s the ashtray and cigarettes I
found. In the side yard. What part of “my dad died of lung cancer” is
hard for you to wrap your brain around?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Do not lie to me, Ben. Please.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you serious? We have like eight thousand
undocumented workers in this house daily. You find cigarettes, and you
automatically assume they’re mine?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Well, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Honey, I’m not lying. And you are really
freaking out. I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing
is going on. Just please - relax.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Ah. My first visitor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This boat is sick. How come you never invited
me out before?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth
and I - for our retirement. Leave our jobs. Sell the house. Take
off.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission to
board granted. I’ll show you around.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal
Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the
bay. Ben stands across from him, looking on.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So Janine sent you to check on me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah. Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Any message from Beth?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think she’s been busy getting ready for her
sister’s funeral though, so…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Her sister’s what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wedding. Her sister’s wedding. What did I
say?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You said funeral.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I didn’t. Shit, did I?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The marriage thing is weird, man. I never
thought Beth would give me an ultimatum.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really? Why not? That’s what women do.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Right. I forgot. That’s how Janine got you to
bite the bullet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Do you regret it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So you’re happy? You’d say you’re happily
married?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I love Janine.</p>
<p><strong>cousin</strong>: Now, I know when my cousin Paige says those
vows tomorrow, there are going to be hearts breaking all over the
world.</p>
<p><strong>cousin</strong>: So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is still
on the market.</p>
<p><strong>cousin</strong>: Sure, she’s an older model, but she’s still
got a lot of miles left in her. But don’t stay on the lot too long,
Bethie, or next year’s models will –</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: OK - that’s enough of the speeches. Time to
eat. So enjoy the crab. And the yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it’s
the crab’s hepatopancreas.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a
jackass.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I know. And even he’s married.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: So, you’ll get married a little bit later than
some people. Big deal. You never did anything the way every one else did
it, and that’s what I’ve always thought was so great about you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m your oldest daughter, and I’m the only one
not married. If this was Fiddler on the Roof you’d have to sacrifice me
or something.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Honey, look. When everyone else was just going
to camp at the Y, you borrowed my New York Times, found some arts camp
in the Berkshires, wrote away for information, then got accepted on your
own. You were nine. You never did things the way everyone else did.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Because that’s you. That’s why you’re my
favorite daughter.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t think you’re supposed to say that.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Well, I don’t give a shit. I’m retired, and
I’ll say what I want. I’ll say it into the mic if you want –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: It’s true, though.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: That’s OK. I like a little time before a blind
date - prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story
about my molars –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Can’t wait to hear that story about the
molars, though.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: How can he already not like me?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday, but
I meant Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Awesome. I’m stuck here with a guy who can’t
distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - - she’s
probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise
thing. She’s interested. He’s not.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You cannot tell from a cursory glance that
he’s not interested.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant. I see
this stuff go down every night. Watch –</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Man, you have a gift.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And check out droopy dawg on her other side.
He can buy her drinks all night, and she’ll insist there’s no
“spark.”</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Maybe there isn’t. You need a spark.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: The “spark” thing is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Really? Enlighten me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Guys invented the “spark” so they could not
call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince
you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a
“spark.” And you all buy it. You love it. You all thrive on it because
you all love drama.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Really? So you don’t wait until the last
minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of
not knowing whether you’ll make it?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And let me guess - when you were stalking
Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even
though the date was just kind of mediocre?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: OK. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be more
like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like
her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: That’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Why are you sharing all this inside dating
information with me again?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I dunno. I like you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t start doodling my name on your binder. I
just mean, I like you, like I like basset hounds. They’re kinda pathetic
- so you want to cheer them up.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Again with the sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It looks good.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: He does good work.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: He’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Javier.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Javier, if I asked you an honest question,
do you think you could give me an honest answer?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Good. Because I think some of your guys have
been - smoking.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Javier?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Is that the question?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Oh. It seemed like a statement.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: The question part was implied -</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I didn’t really hear it in the
inflection-</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Javier - have your guys been smoking or
not?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: No, ma’am. My guys don’t smoke on the job
site. They’re all good guys.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Are you sure your guys aren’t sneaking
around here? And smoking? And lying to me? And – smoking?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: I’m pretty sure.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I need you to be honest with me, Javier.
Because I can’t have someone lying to me. To my face. Under my roof. On
my time.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: That’s a lot of prepositions…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I mean, there is no reason for that kind of
dishonesty, is there? IS THERE? I mean, we made promises to one another
–</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What I mean is, we had a contract. Which is
like making promises to each other, right?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Maybe I should just get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Yes. Fine. Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: But, we’re good here, right? Me and you?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Okay, great. The molding really does look
great.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Hello, my name is Conor. Please sign in
whenever you get a chance.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This is insane. You’re like the Liza Minelli
of real estate.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I know. Your friend Mary’s a genius.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Alright. Gotta run.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You got a class?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Uh, no. Just some stuff. See you later?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: She’s holding out on you, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’m not sure I get your meaning.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s obvious. She won’t sleep with you. It’s
written all over your puppy dog face.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: It’s killing me. Literally. I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Here, have a cookie.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I just - I have no idea what she’s doing. I
cannot read her signals - at all. We used to sleep together - all the
time. Well, that’s not true, I don’t know why I said that, it wasn’t all
the time. But it did happen - I know I’m not making this up. And then,
out of nowhere, it stops. But she still calls, she stops by, she sleeps
on my couch, she wants a massage, she leaves cute messages - but it
never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is she doing?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Honestly - we may not have the best insight.
Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: He’s right. Like - here’s “I want to sleep
with you”.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: One, two, three - that’s it. Three seconds or
more - it’s on.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Here’s “I don’t want to sleep with you.”</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: One, two - No. Thanks for playing. Move
along.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: It’s that simple.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You’re right. That’s no help at all.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or
straight, you’re not going to get anywhere by being inactive. She
clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do
something. So the next time you’re in the position - don’t take no for
an answer.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: That sounds like felonious advice.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’re right. Let me rephrase. Don’t take
maybe for an answer.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shit. This is bad.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I am so into you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m lying here watching you and I seriously
have never felt this way before. I have to forcibly make my brain stop
thinking about you. I mean, all the time.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why stop?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because I don’t do stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Stuff like what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Like having sex with women who are not my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: First of all, I’m not women. I’m just one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s second of all?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I didn’t have a second of all.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I thought second of all was going to make me
feel better.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Second of all - I can’t stop thinking about
you, either.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have to tell her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have to tell her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t want to push you to –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I want to be with you. And I can’t do that if
I’m lying to her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know what’s best.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Here’s the thing - my daughter is happily
married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island. But if
she wasn’t, I’d tell her the same thing I’d like to tell a lot of the
girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married
guy.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And here is that advice — get stocks, cash,
annuities, a deed in your name. Don’t settle for flowers and a shopping
spree at Bendel’s. Think to the future. We all know that none of these
guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and
the classic eight on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these young ladies,
as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time – get
something that can last. Because I guarantee you - he won’t. And that’s
the best fatherly advice I can give.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not picking out china patterns or anything
- but I’ve never felt anything like this before.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This is crazy. I can’t believe he’s gonna
leave his wife for you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, he’s not leaving his wife for me. He’s
just - he’s a good guy. And he can’t really explore what we could be if
he’s lying to her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’s kind of leaving his wife for me. Is this
crazy? This is totally crazy. We barely know each other.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know. Remember Becca, my sister’s
friend. Some guy waits on her at Bennigan’s - by the end of the night
they both knew they had found the one.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re totally right. It can happen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, what about texter?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Texter has yet to make any verbal contact. I
mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box,
breathing through a stoma, and I’d never know because I never actually
hear his voice.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I doubt he has a stoma -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s not the point. The point is - I can’t
text. I’m not charming via text. My sarcasm doesn’t come through, I
can’t type fast enough on the little phone keyboard –</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So don’t text.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s not just texting. It’s email and
voicemail and snail mail -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s just mail -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Whatever. None of it’s working. I’ve had a guy
leave a voicemail for me at work, and then I call him back at home, and
he emails me to my Blackberry, and then I text him to his cell and then
he emails me to my home account from the plane phone – and it just
totally gets out of hand. I miss the days where you had one phone number
with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the
cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn’t. That’s it. Now
you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by
seven different technologies. It’s exhausting.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So what about the singer guy?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jude. Yeah, I like him.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Totally. I felt like we connected.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Oh, hey. You’re home.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Where am I supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Out. It’s Saturday night.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You won’t let me go out with guys who don’t
like me. It’s kind of limiting.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I was just calling to let you know - I’m
having a party at my place next weekend. You should come.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I don’t know. Won’t Conor be there? Might be
kinda awkward.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s in DC for the weekend at some real estate
conference. But there’s gonna be a bunch of single guys.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So I will have plenty of chances to be
awkward. Thank god.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll be there. I’ll talk you
through it.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So, the party - is it like a big party, more
of a mellow hang or –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah, OK. Gotta go - I think someone just
dropped 84 wine glasses.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The TV screen as Mary Stuart Masterson and
Eric Stoltz hang out in a garage.</p>
<p><strong>watts</strong>: Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who’ll be
swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: I think I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>watts</strong>: It’s cool. I was just gonna work on it with
you but - if you’re comfortable…great.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Wait. How do you work on it?</p>
<p><strong>watts</strong>: Pretend I’m a girl, OK? I mean, pretend I’m
her…Amanda.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He’s into me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Awesome. I knew it. Who’s this now?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Alex. It’s totally clear to me now. He’s
Watts.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: From Some Kind of Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Wait, isn’t Mary Stuart Masterson Watts?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: So, why aren’t you Watts?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m Eric Stoltz.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz
go on a date with Amanda Jones, but really she’s in love with Eric
Stoltz herself.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Wait - so who’s Amanda Jones?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I guess Conor at first. Now men in general.
But that’s not the point. The point is – he’s into me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You know, I knew there had to be a reason he
was spending all that time with you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I know! It’s so obvious now – there are so
many signs.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oooh, gimme the signs. I love to hear about
the signs.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: At first they were small - like when I first
called he said “Good to hear from you” -</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Totally good sign.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Right? And then the next time I called he was
with a woman - but he still took the call. And talked to me for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You know it was a woman?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He called her “babe.”</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to
another woman - unless there’s something going on.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I know! And it gets more obvious. I mean,
please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with. The fix up was
him.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Wait - really?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He shows up - without this fictitious Bill
character - and the two of us basically have a date. And then he calls
me to invite me to a party at his place.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You’re right. He so likes you.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Let’s look up places for your destination
wedding. Would you guys wanna do Napa Valley - I’ve always wanted to go
there.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There’s no way he’s already called - we only
met for coffee last night. I mean we video iChatted. While holding
coffee. Kinda like having coffee.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Just call your voice mail.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And he told me he had a gig last night, so he
probably got in real late. Did I tell you he was singer?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just call.</p>
<p><strong>joshua</strong>: On speaker.</p>
<p><strong>your soul-ution</strong>: Maaaary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Maaaary.
Oh my Maaary.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I just got hard.</p>
<p><strong>your soul-ution</strong>: Hey Mary, it’s Jude. Just wanted to
tell you again how special it was to meet you. So, call me back.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Amazing. He’ll sing to your babies.</p>
<p><strong>your soul-ution</strong>: Jeeeeny. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny,
Jeeeeny.</p>
<p><strong>your soul-ution</strong>: Hey Jenny, it’s Jude. Just wanted
to – oh shit, - what number did I call?</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: TWO SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL PLANKS OF WOOD. We
pull back to reveal Ben and Janine, in the wide aisle of Home Depot, as
Janine really studies the two pieces of wood. Finally, she POINTS to one
of them.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. That’s the laminate.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: That one isn’t real hardwood floor?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. But it looks exactly the same - at like one
one hundredth of the cost.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I still wanna go with the real wood.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But you can’t even tell the difference.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I just don’t like the way it’s pretending to
be wood. If you’re not wood, then don’t try to look like wood.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t think it’s pretending –</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s a lie. Just be up front - tell people
what you really are.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re right. I’m sorry. You’re totally
right.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s OK. Maybe we should look at the grills
and come back.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I slept with someone.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I heard you.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You tell me this in Home Depot because you
know how I hate a public scene.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That is not why I -</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I knew it. I KNEW IT. You asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: And it’s you that’s been smoking, too, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What? Why does that matter?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. No. I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I could
stay on his boat for a while if –</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: EXCUSE ME? And now you want to move out?
You’re like - what - leaving me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. NO. I just assumed that you wouldn’t want
me to –</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: We’re not going to deal with this? We’re not
going to figure out a way to work through this?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I just assumed that once I told you, you would
want me – out.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You must be Beth.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’ve heard a lot about you from Paige. I’d been
lobbying for weeks to be seated next to her single sister.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh, yeah? So you are - Dan.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Uh, sort of.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well, I’m actually a wiccan. So I have a
magickal name.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s Brother Phoenix East-Horse. But I didn’t
know if that would fit on a card.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: It makes your breath stink.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I made out
with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff. He said my breath
smelled like trout.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m sorry. That was rude. And that guy I
made out with was a total asshole.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You want me to smell you? I’m sure you don’t
smell like trout.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Thanks. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: I’m Nathan. This is Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Gigi. How do you guys know Alex?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We don’t. Our friend Mary heard about it from
some guy named Conor.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: How do you know Alex?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I hope - I mean I’m pretty sure - something is
about to happen between us.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: So, you’re here as like a guest, or like his
date?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I hate that - when you don’t know if you’re a
date - so you don’t know if you should bring a friend, or if you’re like
co-hosting or if you should stay til the end to have alone time –</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: He didn’t really say.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: But I’m sure I’m more than just a guest. I
mean - there have been signs.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I did get a slight waft of trout, though.
Take a mint.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: So, where’s Neil?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We actually broke up.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: No way. You guys were together for like ten
years.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Seven. But yes, a long time.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Too bad cousins can’t marry, huh? Cuz then
we could maybe –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Eeew Dominic, gross.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I had no idea it would be such a madhouse.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hey. Great party.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Are any guys hitting on you? Do you need me to
evaluate their level of interest?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: They were gay. Even I know that their level of
interest was probably low.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Well - too bad Bill couldn’t make it. I still
think you guys would hit it off.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Oh OK. Right. “Bill”.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Anyway - I’m on my way to put out some more
liquor. But it looks like the food could use some refreshing –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Would you mind helping? I mean, just refill
the chips and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You mean, kind of like — co-hosting?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Uhh, OK. The chips are on top of the
fridge.</p>
<p><strong>party-goer #1</strong>: Really great party.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have a
party, I was like “Let’s do it.”</p>
<p><strong>party-goer #2</strong>: Thanks so much for having us.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: No problem. Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Can I help you find something?</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: No, that’s OK. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: Thanks for mixing that up.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: Alex asked me to get the dip together.
Thanks for getting it started.</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: Hmmm - could use a little more dill.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: When someone’s underwear ends up in your
toaster oven - it’s been a good party.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I guess people had fun.</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: Alex, you want me to start cleaning
up?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: That’s sweet of you. But I thought I’d stick
around, so I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: No. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Knock yourselves out.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I think I’ve rounded up the last of the beer
bottles.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So, umm - what game is this?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Well, maybe I should just – you know – I mean
it’s past three and –</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: YES!! Suck it!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You are sensational.</p>
<p><strong>tall girl</strong>: Did you say it’s past three? Man, I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but
I really gotta get to bed.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Is that an invitation?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’m sorry. That was cheesy. I’m not good at
this.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I knew it. I knew it. The best relationships
grow out of friendships.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Wait - what?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Ummmm….</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Now you and I are in a relationship?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Well, I’d say if we’re not at relationship
station–ship, we’re at least on the track.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: And why would you think that, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Because there were - you know - signs.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Really? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Ummm - it was good to hear from me. You talked
to me even when you were with a girl. I felt something…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What are you talking about? What have I been
saying since I met you? If a guy wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT
HAPPEN.</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why would you do this?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I thought you were Watts.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Why do women do this? Why do they build this
stuff up in their minds, take each little thing a guy does and twist it
into something else –</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I’d rather be like that - than like you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Maybe I dissect each little thing, and put
myself out there too much, and maybe I even thrive on the drama of it
all– but at least that means I still care. You think you’ve won because
women are expendable to you? Sure, you don’t get hurt or make an ass of
yourself that way, but you don’t fall in love that way, either. You
haven’t won, Alex. You’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I may do a lot of stupid shit - but I know I’m
a lot closer to finding someone than you are.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hey Janine, I’m sorry it’s so late, but I just
- don’t start picking out your bridesmaid dress, OK? I know this isn’t
the first time this has happened, it’s just - this one wasn’t about
whether he liked me. I just really liked him.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You want anything else?</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Yeah. Less of that cardboardy brown stuff. More
regular people food.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: The cardboardy brown stuff is called whole
grain bread.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Maybe you could just fry me up a couple sausage
links?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: People who have just had heart attacks
generally are not advised to eat animal fat, stuffed in synthetic
casings.</p>
<p><strong>ken</strong>: Did I tell you that you’re not only my favorite
daughter, but you’re also the prettiest? So much better looking than
those other dogs. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s not gonna work this time. But I
appreciate the effort.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer if you’re going
that way?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And a little plate of cold cuts if there are
any left?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You might wanna kill the volume just a smidge.
My mom is finally taking a nap.</p>
<p><strong>devon</strong>: You think your dad really wants to hang on to
all this vinyl? My collection could use a bunch of these.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Turn it the fuck down.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I finally got mom to lay down in the spare
room. All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so
after I tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store. Our
new brother is trying to co-opt dad’s property before he’s even
dead.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: And Laura, your husband would really like a
beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s OK. It’s all gonna be OK.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: What am I gonna do without dad?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: First of all, he’s upstairs watching ‘Oprah
After The Show’.</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: And second of all - you have us.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: But he’s always been - the one who’s
there for me.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What about your husband? Where the hell is
he?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Playing ultimate frisbee. His team may
make the quarterfinals.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Do you know who it is?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So are you going to - leave - him?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Gigi, he’s my husband. He’s not just some
guy that didn’t call me back. And he did admit it to me. He didn’t wait
to get caught. That takes courage.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. I know Alex
was not just some guy.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s my fault, you know.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I’m willing to accept my responsibility in
this. I forced him into getting married. He wasn’t ready.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Janine - this is not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It is. I’ve - changed. I used to be fun. I
was fun when we met.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You’re still fun.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: We never have sex anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Lots of couples got through lulls.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No. We never have sex. Realistically, what
did I expect him to do?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: I don’t think that’s really –</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: This is too small. I gotta tell Javier.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: This tile. I gotta go. Tell Beth I took a
personal day.</p>
<p><strong>mariel</strong>: My first husband was unimpressive. I found
him in bed with his big breasted secretary when I came home early from
the Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him. My second
husband was a pinch more creative. Cheated on me with my sister - but
made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious. At last - some
intrigue, some mind games - though my sister’s two year old eventually
gave them up. But my last husband – he was a gem. A veritable master at
covering his tracks. I poured over his phone records, intercepted his
credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions - and never
found a single shred of evidence. It wasn’t until he died that I found
out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress. But the real
master, I have to say – is me. Three husbands – countless boyfriends,
and I haven’t been caught yet.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It was all you, babe.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is really good news.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I cannot believe this. He liked my demo. Did
you hear what he said? When he said it was hauntingly beautiful? Did you
hear that part?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yep. I was sitting right there.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How is it that every time I see your body, I’m
shocked at how beautiful it is?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Dana, I need to go over the offering statement.
Can I get a few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s not Dana.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shit. I told Dana to get this lock fixed. One
sec.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Why do you even lock it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d never get anything done if I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Janine, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I don’t know. I just thought - maybe we
could, you know, relight the fire.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Honey, did you hear what I just said? I gotta
get this offering statement out.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Look, I am trying here. Do you want to save
our marriage or don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Then you’ll let me do this.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Yeah, just like that, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and pitch in
with the servers when you -</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: No…I’m on 8 thru 10. I’m always on 8 through
10. Been working here 18 months doing 8 through 10.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Right. Luis you take 4 through 6.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Dude. Luis quit like 10 months ago.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Do we even need to have this meeting?
Seriously? Does this serve any purpose?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Good. Great. Get to work.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me?</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Since you asked me 11 minutes ago? No,
not a lot of phone traffic.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: It’s happened to you.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What has happened to me?</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: The girl, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: There’s no girl.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: You can’t hide it man. I know strung out
and you are strung - out.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Please -</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: This is amazing. Can’t focus, right?
Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your email 100 times a
day. Wishing you could write songs. Feeling the need to bring up her
name in random conversations…</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: It’s always the same. And it has happened
to you, my friend. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>kelli ann</strong>: Welcome to my world asshole.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You sure I can’t interest you in a little
beef and broccoli? I’m treating.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I really gotta get this stuff done.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: OK. I’ll see you at home. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I had no choice. What was I supposed to do when
she -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You make me sick to my stomach. You are a
disgusting excuse for a man -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I didn’t want to do it, Anna. You know that
it’s you I want to be with -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Are you kidding me? You will never lay a hand
on me again. I may just be a piss poor girl from Dundalk who works at a
gym - but I am so too good for you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Dino, thank you again for letting me pay over
the phone. I assure you this late payment thing will never happen again.
Yep – just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: That’s my other line. OK. B-bye.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mans’ voice</strong>: Hi, Gigi. This is Bill.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Ummm -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Alex’s friend. We were supposed to meet up -
but Alex told me the wrong day.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Bill. So you do exist.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I do. And I’d love to buy you dinner sometime
if you’re game.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Yes. Sure. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m gonna go. I left the check on the counter.
It should at least get you through this month.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Thanks sweetie. I don’t know what I would do
without you.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Baby - what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Is it money? Because you can take back the
check if -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, it’s not that. I mean - yes, I’m broke -
but it’s not that. It’s just - I’m just so lost mom. I’ve been seeing
this guy - who is exciting and amazing and thoroughly unavailable. I
thought he was - the one - but he turned out to be such an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And then there’s -</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Conor -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeah. Who I’m so horrible to. But he takes it.
And he’s - there. Waiting. But I just don’t want to - I don’t know -</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Settle? Like you think I did?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Well, your father and I had a glorious life
together.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Are you kidding? All you talk about are the
things you didn’t do, the people you wish you could have been with, the
Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Those are just dreams Anna.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Now true - I did not like your father at all
when we met.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Or after we got married for that matter. But
let me tell you this - life with him was a hell of a lot better than
life is without him.</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: There are worse things in life than
settling.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>maya</strong>: Like wishing you had.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hey, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: See, why did you call me sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Because we always call each other that.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I want to say something, OK? I mean, we call
each other sweetie, and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for
hours and I washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder surgery
and everything - it’s like we’re together.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I know that I -</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Let me finish. Maybe it’s my fault. Maybe I
haven’t been clear about what I want. So let me be clear. I love hanging
out, but I am so attracted to you, and I just - I want both. I want to
make love to you. I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of
my mouth - I just freaked myself out, too - but it’s true. And I’m not
sure what happened, or why we stopped - but I don’t really care. I just
–</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I’m talking about really doing this. Like a
full-on relationship.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: With me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Did a bunch of gay people put you up to
this?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>devon</strong>: Shit! Take him out. He’s done.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jesus. This isn’t some exhibition game.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Could you –</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Did anyone have time to run to the store?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nah, we’re good. We just got drive
through.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I didn’t mean for you.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The dishes are all put away. There’s a load of
laundry still drying, but the other one is folded on top of the
washer.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I remembered what your dad likes, but I tried
to get healthy stuff, too.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Ben told me. I just - I wanted to help.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I know how much you love him. But it’s gonna
be OK.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Javier - does this mean what I think it
means? So when you say “done” - you don’t mean “we still need plumbing
in the upstairs bathrooms done” - you mean “done done”?…Wow - you’re
amazing…OK…I’ll call when I see it…Bye.</p>
<p><strong>cut wide to reveal</strong>: Ben sitting on a ledge in front
of the gym, smoking a cigarette, watching the passersby. He’s clearly
waiting for Anna to arrive.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s been a while since I’ve been here. Turns
out - that boat in the next mooring, looks like yours – not yours.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, it’s no problem. Nice guy. Invited me in
for a white wine spritzer. Not sure he gets a lot of visitors.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I wanted to thank you. For coming by my folks’
house.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Of course. I really care about your dad. And I
really love you. Even if I can’t give you what you want.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You’re what I want.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Our life together is what I want. Your love is
what I want. Did you see those guys my sisters are married to? You are a
better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real
husbands will ever be. And that’s enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: And you’d really be OK if we take the marriage
thing off the table?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: If you promise to love me and be committed to
me -</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I always have -</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Wait, I’m not done. And snake the shower drain
when my hair clogs it, and let me eat Wheat Thins in bed.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: So, I get to move back in?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I guess. But, you cannot bring those.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What? You’re just mad at me, and you’re taking
it out on the pants.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Look, I gotta win something. I let you win the
big battle, so throw me a bone.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: OK. We’re not getting married, but I’m
chucking the pants.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Great. We both win.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Hey, Gigi. It’s Alex. I was just wondering how
you were doing. It’s been a little while since we’ve talked – and I was
wondering how you were doing.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you.
Obviously. But you’re out. So, call me. Sometime. Or tonight. I’m
around. OK. That’s enough now. It’s Alex.</p>
<p><strong>tyrone</strong>: Dude.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You seriously get a ton of people bidding on
this?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I know it’s crazy. But it’s a neighborhood
“in transition.”</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So that means what - that hip gay people want
to live out here?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples, young
families.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Weird - it totally reminds me of the house I
grew up in. I bet there is a -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We totally had this same thing. My mom would
use this as her ‘desk’. Isn’t that bizarre? It was always covered with
her little coupons and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So, when do all the fabulous homosexual
couples start arriving?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Well, the open house is tomorrow. But I have
this one buyer. I mean, I want to see if his girlfriend likes it first
-</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: His girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: I mean, I had this idea -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: An idea for the open house?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: No, an idea. For this house. For - me. To
buy. And hopefully, if you like it and things continue to - you
know…</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Anna, look. I have a plan. I know where my
life is going. And I want you to go with me. I mean - I’m not saying you
have to move in now or anything - I just - I don’t want to buy a place
that you couldn’t - at some point - see yourself moving into.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: So what do you think? I mean gut reaction. I
always go with my gut when it comes to real estate or —</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t do this Conor.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: OK. If it’s too fast -</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. I mean this. Any of this. What you’re
saying - what you’re offering - is what every girl wants. It’s what I’ve
always wanted. It’s just -</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You don’t want it with me.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: So, I have a question.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Is it too late to dial it back to before -
and just keep sleeping together?</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Because I thought that really - you know -
gelled.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: So, Alex told me you work in finance.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes. Yes, I do. Finance.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: This is nice.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: A nice evening. And you planned it. And called
me when you said you would. And showed up on time. Thank you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hey it’s Gigi. You’ve reached my cell. I’m
either having a very good time or in a meeting - either way just leave a
message and –</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: It was nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thank you for a lovely evening.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Did you forget something?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah. I did.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Really? What did you forget?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>same pen that gigi pretended to be returning to
conor.</strong>: Gigi tries, without success, to suppress a SMILE.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: How did all this stuff fit in here fine
before?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know. It expanded.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No you are not trying to bring these back in
here -</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What? I have no idea what you’re -</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We had a deal. These are not staying.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: That’s really gonna free up a lot of
space.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: They’re going. I have a bag I’m taking to the
Goodwill.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay, okay. You win. Just check to make sure
there’s nothing in the pockets before we give them away.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I love you so much. So much. I want to make
you happy. I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being
happy, too.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes. Of course, yes.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: You came all the way here - at 11 at night -
to give me back a promotional pen?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I thought I better come up with some excuse to
get over here. Isn’t that how it’s done?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Look, I can’t stop thinking about you. I drive
by your place. I call and hang up. I’m turning into -</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Well, a wise person once told me that if a guy
wants to be with a girl, he will make it happen. No matter what.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hmmm. Because when I was hurling my body onto
yours - you did not seem to want to “make it happen.”</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Here’s the thing about that. You were right.
I’ve gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these
women, having the power - that I didn’t know what it felt like when I
actually - fell - for one of them.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Look, I’ve just been out with your friend
Bill. And it just might be exactly what I need. No drama. He calls. He
does what he says.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I could do that stuff too.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: But you didn’t. And that same wise person told
me that I am the rule. That I have to stop thinking that every guy will
change - stop thinking that I will be the –</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: - that I will be the exception.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You are my exception.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Jonathan?</p>
<p><strong>nattily dressed gay</strong>: What are you guys doing up
there?</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Dancing. Get your asses up here.</p>
<p><strong>nattily dressed gay</strong>: This is Conor. He just sold us
on the most amazing duplex in Mt. Vernon.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hey, Conor. I’m Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s so great to finally meet you in
person.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Would you like to dance?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>out. - janine p.s. i want a divorce.</strong>: Ben slumps
down, devastated.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up. If
a guy punches you, he likes you. Never try to trim your own bangs.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: And someday you will meet a wonderful guy and
get your very own happy ending.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Every movie we see, every story we’re told,
implores us to wait for it. The third act twist…the man who couldn’t get
it together finally figuring it out…the unexpected declaration of
love…</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: …the exception to the rule.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: What we’re not taught is how to read the
signs.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: How to tell the ones who want us from the ones
who don’t. The one’s who’ll stay from the one’s who’ll leave.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: And ultimately, we’re not taught the one thing
that could save ourselves, our friends, our families countless hours of
confusion, despair, and speculation.</p>
<p><strong>new guy</strong>: It was nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: That sometimes the happy ending…is just moving
on.</p>
