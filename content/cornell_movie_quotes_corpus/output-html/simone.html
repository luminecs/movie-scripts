<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: Mr. Taransky –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’s walking?… Don’t tell me she’s walking.
She is not walking… She can’t walk.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Nicola! How was your massage?</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: You’re in breach.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Is this about the new pages? – I made the
changes you wanted, you’re in virtually every scene –</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: It’s not the size of the role, Viktor. Am I
or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the
set?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: silver fish behind them, It’s the biggest on
earth! I swear! It’s a 50-foot Airstream – they don’t make them any
longer than that.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: Taller, Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Taller? What?</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: You’ve insulted me for the last time.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Nicola, it’s just the tires – they’re
over-inflated! I can fix it!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: See, it’s lower already.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I beg you. You can’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: I had three other offers. I only signed on
to this picture out of… loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Then show some. They’ll shut me down!</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: It wasn’t working anyhow. The scene with the
thousand geese – I don’t understand this film. I don’t think anyone will
understand it. I already put out a press release – citing “creative
differences”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You know what, Nicola, you’re right. Here,
let me help you with that. You ought to go. The truth is I don’t deserve
you. This film doesn’t deserve you. Frankly, it deserves much, much
better. The reason it’s not working is because you’re not about the
work.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: To Hell, please.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: What are you looking at? Get back to
work.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: Jack… are you there?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m here. I’m right beside you.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: You should really go now.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: No, it’s alright. Please, let him stay.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: What kind of cruel God is it that would take
you away from me?</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: The same one who brought me to you.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: No… I cannot accept it. If something like this
can happen. What… What is it for?</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: – Why are we here? Is that what you’re
asking, Jack?… Why are we here? No why. Just here.</p>
<p><strong>executive 1</strong>: She’s good. You can hardly tell she’s
reading off a teleprompter.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’ve analyzed the footage. We’ve got almost
everything we need in the can. If we rework the script, we can finish
the film without her.</p>
<p><strong>executive 2</strong>: According to the writ her attorneys
filed at noon today. They’ll sue if the film is released with Nicola in
a single frame.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: So we’ll re-cast.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play
that role.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s a re-make, Hal. Anders is not bigger
than this picture.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Of course she is. No other name is going to
sign on now and risk offending her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: We don’t need a name. We’ll cast an
unknown.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I won’t play opposite an unknown.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: We can’t sell an unknown. Nicola’s soured on
the project and we have to accept that. If we ever want to be in the
Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the
picture.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No! You will not give in to that
blackmailing bitch!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: God, Viktor. Why do you always have to make
things so difficult for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Difficult. I’m difficult.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Do you know what these are, Elaine?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hmm… Mike and Ike’s.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Not just any Mike &amp; Ike’s – cherry Mike
&amp; Ike’s. Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award
nominated director –</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – Viktor, that was Short Subject.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – overseeing the most cherished movie
project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike
&amp; Ike’s?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – I have a feeling you’re going to tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – I’ll tell you why. It is because Miss
Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God’s gift to cinema, has it
written into her contract that all cherry Mike &amp; Ike’s be removed
from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she
walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three
of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of
her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly
with her first class.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Elaine, she doesn’t have any children! Don’t
you see? We’re being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone
somewhere has decreed are the A-list.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: The public decides who’s on that list.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s the truth. Those 17 superstars are our
insurance policy. We can’t open – can’t make a profit without them.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: We can hardly make a profit with them.
Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages – They’re
mocking us, Elaine. We’re at their mercy. We always had movie stars but
they used to be our stars. We used to decide who would play what role.
We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date. When they were
under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to – more than
once!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You realize you’re nostalgic for an era you
weren’t even born in?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Well, I do remember why I started out in
this business – you seem to have forgotten – working in New York with
Cassevetes – we were trying to do something important, shine a light in
that darkened cinema –</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – It’s called a projector.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of
truth.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of
those days too – but this isn’t about that or you or me or some
high-minded ideal. This is business.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Spare me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you
think pays for all this? This is about investment and return. Those days
in New York… that’s… it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’re not renewing my contract.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: How can I? Your last three pictures tanked.
The board is giving me hell. No bankable star will work with you after
this. If you just compromised… a little.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Well, it’s not every day you’re fired by
the mother of your own child.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m not taking away your daughter, just your
deal. You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old
time’s sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey. I
called what’s his name at Warner’s. He said he’d take a meeting – in
July. I’ve fought for you Viktor… You want to talk severance?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You can have everything – office, car,
assistants – all I want is the picture.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: The picture’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: So there’s no problem – I can have the
rights, the negative too?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: They’re yours. But how are you going to
finish it? Without a star there’s no movie.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I don’t need a star. All I need is an actor
– I’ll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real
actor. A real leading lady.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Even if you find her, you know the problem
with unknowns, Viktor. If they’re good, they get known. And then you’re
back to sorting their candy… and worse. as she departs in her I’m sorry,
Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Hi, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hello, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I’m sorry Mom canned you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s really… not anything, Lainey. It’s just
–</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Don’t feel too bad. Mom runs the place and
they still walk all over her. You’re better off out of it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You look very grown up. What are you doing?
You meeting your mom for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Kent got tickets to the ballet.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: himself as much as I’m going to finish the
picture, sweetheart. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I know you’ll do it, Dad. You’re Viktor
Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: That’s right. I’m Viktor Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: You had no choice, Elaine. He’s a
liability.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He also happens to be the most talented man
I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>“over-priced, over-pampered prima donnas”</strong>: -
Director’s Future Now In Doubt -</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: – On your left, the house where Claris
Commodore uttered those now immortal words, “If that door doesn’t hold,
stand behind me”. And coming up on your right –</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: – Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky… thank God. I’ve
been trying to see you, calling – Your assistant wouldn’t put me
through. I told her it was a matter of life and death. I was afraid I
wouldn’t get to you in time –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Please, get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I did it, Mr. Taransky. I licked skin. I
licked hair. I licked every part of her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: he is dealing with a You want me to call
Security?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I have her, Mr. Taransky. The answer to your
prayers. The answer to this.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I was misquoted.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I have your new leading lady… … right here in
my pants.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: It’s me, Mr. Taransky. Don’t you recognize me?
– The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank… Hank Aleno. I was
keynote speaker. You must remember my speech… “Who Needs Humans?”</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: That’s right. You were booed off the stage.
That’s got to be – ?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: – Eight years ago. In that whole time, I never
left my computer.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Good for you, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Good and bad. They think that’s what caused
this. Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen. It’s the size of a
grapefruit. Heavy too.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: figure with the tilted I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Don’t be. It was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: You have to see her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’ve seen them all before.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Not like this –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Come on, Hank. A synthespian, virtual actor
– ?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: – We call them “vactors”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I need flesh and –</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: – Flesh is weak.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – a living, breathing actor – I can’t work
with a fake.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: You already do. But my actor won’t get old,
fat, lazy or drunk – won’t throw tantrums, demand a body double, script
changes or a bigger trailer. The Disney Corporation has been using
artificial actors for years.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: That’s the point, Hank. No matter how good
they are, they’re still Mickey Mouse. Everyone’s tried. Everyone’s
failed. It can’t be done.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: It can – with my new computer code, you and
me, we can do it together.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I don’t know anything about computers.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: That’s why you’re so perfect. You have
something I don’t have.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: An eye – for performance. You know the truth
when you see it. I know. I’ve seen your movies. I love your movies.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: “Straw God” changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You saw that?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I’ve seen every frame of your work. You’re the
only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my
vision. You and me, art and science… we are the perfect marriage.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Listen, Hank, it’s been a rough day. I’ll
call you about his next week.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I won’t be here next week. The tumor’s
inoperable. I’ll be dead.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Call me. This week!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – What do you mean she won’t work with me?
She’s done nothing. She doesn’t have a single credit –</p>
<p><strong>agent’s voice</strong>: – Better no credits than a Taransky
credit. No young actress is going to step into Nicola Anders’ shoes and
risk ending her career before it’s even started.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Art, you don’t understand. I’ve mortgaged
everything to finish this film – creditors calling, coming to the house,
for God’s sake, I need this –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Damn.</p>

Hell”. But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She still with Kent?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: This week anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Not quite how I imagined it –</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: – You finished the film on your own terms,
that’s what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: There was no other way.</p>

<p><strong>simone</strong>: – Why are we here? Is that what you’re
asking, Jack?… Why are we here? No why. Just here.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I may be
guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions,
to send a message to the acting community who put themselves above the
work and above –</p>
<p><strong>audience member 1</strong>: conversation from the – So
fake.</p>
<p><strong>audience member 2</strong>: – Totally artificial.</p>
<p><strong>audience member 1</strong>: We’re really supposed to believe
that was 19th Century Lisbon?</p>
<p><strong>audience member 3</strong>: Who’s looking at the sets when
she is on the screen?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: There he is. That’s my dad, Viktor
Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>audience member 4</strong>: – She is magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>audience member 5</strong>: – Absolutely unreal.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She wasn’t too… cartoony?</p>
<p><strong>audience member 6</strong>: – Who? The nun?</p>
<p><strong>audience member 7</strong>: – Or are you talking about the
mother?</p>
<p><strong>audience member 8</strong>: – A star like that, who cares
about the supporting cast?</p>
<p><strong>audience member 9</strong>: – Congratulations again. She was…
not of this earth. You should be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: “Not of this earth”. A good way of putting
it. And the film as a whole – ?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: She’s a miracle, Dad. Where did you find
her?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I saw her picture on the, er… internet. You
really didn’t notice anything – unusual?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Only her brilliance. To be honest, with what
you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck. You really pulled
it off.</p>

back after this.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Back on the lot.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor, you bastard! I hear it’s great.
Seriously, I’m happy for you.</p>

your door but… well, I’d love the chance to buy back something I gave

<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: But who is Simone? We know
so little about her. No details of her background have been released,
not even her age. She is somewhere between a girl and a woman. A fresh
face and familiar both at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: Is Simone even her real

discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky.</p>

<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Why isn’t she with you?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Why? Because she would never show up at
something like this. She’s intensely private.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Back to work, everyone. She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor… I want to thank you for convincing
Simone to sign with the studio.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Don’t thank me. It was entirely Simone’s
decision. Do you have Simone’s check?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t have it on me. Anyway, it means a
lot. Have you read the reviews? They’re love letters. Listen to this
one. “Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia
Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn
combined with an angel”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Almost right.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I can’t wait to meet her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I don’t know if that’s going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: As I say, she’s… something of a recluse.
That’s how she’s able to stay so pure – by isolating herself in her
art.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous. I arranged a press
conference.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Out of the question. A circus like that?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor, it’s my studio.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’s my actor. There are other studios,
Elaine. There’s only one Simone. Leave the press conference to me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Is this on?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Taransky, Viktor. T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
V-i-k-t-o-r.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: Yeah, but – who are you?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I am a two-time Academy Award nominated
director with over eighteen films to my credit thus far including my
latest release, “Sunrise, Sunset”. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I will not be taking any questions. However
I do have a statement to read on behalf of my leading lady, Simone. “To
Whom It May Concern. I’m deeply grateful for the extraordinary public
response to Mr. Taransky’s film. At this time I will be conducting no
interviews or making publicity appearances since I am really nothing
without the beautiful worlds and characters Mr. Taransky creates for me.
I politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work
speak for itself. All questions and inquiries should be directed to
Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all aspects of my career. Yours very
truly, Simone”.</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: – Viktor, Viktor, who’s Simone
dating?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 3</strong>: – Viktor, where’d you find her?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 4</strong>: – Is Simone her real name?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 5</strong>: – What’s she got to hide?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: – Is she the new Garbo?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: – Who’s Garbo?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I thought I made it clear – no questions
regarding Simone. conference to a hasty Now, I would like to close by
announcing that Miss Simone begins production today on her next film,
“Eternity Forever”. This project has been near and dear to my heart
since I wrote it nine years ago. I Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who do you think you’re fooling,
Taransky?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Max Sayer – National Echo.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Don’t you have a real story to write? Why
aren’t you in Latin America?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is the story.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I remember when the Echo had class – the
paper that could bring down governments.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Our leaders aren’t presidents anymore – they’re
pop stars and screen idols. If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today,
they’d be right here in Hollywood with me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: They are alive, Sayer.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So they’re probably here. You might be able to
sell this ‘disappearing act’ to the rest of the world, but I’m not
buying it. What’s really behind this Simone woman? The public has a
right to know. Why is she staying out of sight? And why the hell is she
with you? I don’t want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but
you’re not exactly Cecil B. DeMille – more run-of-the-mill.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Maybe the reason she’s with me is a little
thing called integrity, Sayer. Look it up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, I know all about integrity. I know even
more about persistence. Look that one up.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: No one came in or went out just like
you said, Mr. Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Is Miss Simone coming today?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’s already here. She arrived before you
and she’ll leave long after you’ve gone. Remember, under no
circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my
express permission.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: What if it catches on fire?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Let it burn. Simone would rather go up in
flames than give up her privacy.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: his Hollywood hard-drive</p>
<p>****: Pay no attention to the man behind the computer.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Good morning, Simone.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: A star is…</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: … digitized.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: You mean they buy it?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: examines his first Buy it? They’re paying
for it. And around here that’s how you really know they buy it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m only sorry Hank isn’t here to see
this.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: every time he wants to express his
thoughts Maybe he can.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Do you have any idea what this means,
Simone? Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to
detect it.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: I am the death of real.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You are birth of… what? A Phenomenon. A
miracle. A new era in show business. All I wanted to do was finish the
film.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: And now look what you’ve started.
And now look what you’ve started. And now look what you’ve started.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hmm… a little less Streep, a little more
Bacall.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Is that better, Mr. Taransky?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes. Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: While I think of it, I’d like you to add
something to your repertoire – remember that thing Hepburn does in
“Breakfast At Tiffany’s”.</p>
<p><strong>audrey hepburn</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Let’s hear you say “Hi” like Audrey.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Perfect. God, I’m so relaxed around you.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: You did create me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No. I… just helped bring someone else’s
dream to life.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
nothing without you. I was computer code – ones and zeros.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’re right. You’re right. Of course, one
doesn’t want to boast. It’s a classic case of technology in search of an
artist. That’s all you’ve been waiting for, an artist with integrity,
with a vision, who can see.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: See beyond that irrational allegiance to
flesh and blood. – See that with the rise in price of a real actor and
the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the
fake. – See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn’t matter if the
actor is real. Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and
bones are gone anyway. Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides,
what’s real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to
them so it’s a gray area.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Are you ever going to tell the
truth about me, Mr. Taransky?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: The only real truth is in the work.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: You know what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes. Yes, I’m going to tell the truth about
you, why wouldn’t I…? Of course, with Hank’s tragic passing, the secret
died with him. I am going to tell the truth… after your next
picture.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Speaking of which – this is the project I’d
like you to do next.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Not, “Eternity Forever”? The
legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made? I’d kill
for that part.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I was hoping you’d say that.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’ll do anything to please you,
Mr. Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. What did you
say?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’ll do anything to please you,
Mr. Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: And I will never, ever leave
you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’re so beautiful. Too beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>valet manager</strong>: – Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky. We
gave you a complimentary car wash – they’re washing the engine now.</p>
<p><strong>talent agent</strong>: Viktor! Look, I’m sorry I didn’t call
you back last year. I was, er… out of the country. But we should get
together. My schedule’s wide open.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Sure, I’ll… “call you”.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Viktor, I’m so happy for us!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hello, Hal.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: The film. The chemistry. No reflections on
Nicola but Simone and I – we were just so right together.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You never were together, Hal.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: And still the connection was undeniable. I
haven’t read “Eternity Forever” but I know it’s brilliant. And I know I
would be perfect for Clive.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Yes, perfect. As a matter of fact, I ran into
Simone on the lot the other day.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Really? She didn’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m sure she’s meeting with a lot of people
right now. She is just as you described her, Viktor… indescribable. I
strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: has just dialed, louder Hello?… SIMONE! How
are you, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’ll never guess who I’m with… you ran
into him on the lot.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It was more in passing.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’re so far off! Hal… Hal Sinclair… your
co- star. Remember now?… No, I don’t think he’s put on weight. Anyway,
you think he’s right for “Eternity Forever”?… not the right type?… a
different direction… I’ll try to talk her into it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: … Listen this is a bad place to talk… what?…
sweetheart, I know you have charity work you want to do, I know you want
to give back – but remember, your greatest gift is your talent… we’ll
talk about it at the beach house this weekend… I’m looking forward to it
too.</p>
<p><strong>viktor’s voice</strong>: – “… You think he’s right
for”Eternity Forever”?… not the right type?… a different direction…”</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m getting nothing from her side of the
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is it a jamming device?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Maybe he’s talking to himself.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Taransky isn’t that good an actor. No, they’re
taking special precautions. Some kind of new encryption.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Whatever it is, it’s dark.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Dark?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, very.</p>
<p><strong>viktor’s voice</strong>: “… We’ll talk about it at the beach
house this weekend…”</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Can’t you stop that?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a
screen all day – you miss what’s going on outside in the real world. You
can lose yourself. You should get out more. How are you going to meet
boys?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I know plenty of boys.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Really? Who? Where do you meet them? In a
chat room? How do you know he’s not some middle-aged freak?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile
away.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Okay. But you have to find a way to escape
that thing.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I read.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You do? Still? I can’t tell you how happy I
am to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: You were the one who insisted on it. Reading
me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You understood them. That’s what was
amazing. It’s a nice day. Let’s eat outside.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Actually, it may be nicer inside.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Stay here, I’ll deal with this.</p>
<p><strong>photographer 1</strong>: That wasn’t her, Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>echo photographer</strong>: Where is she? You can’t hide her
forever.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’ll never find her. Simone only appears
when I want her to appear.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky. Are you
holding her hostage? Are you some kind of Svengali?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Who’s the hostage, Sayer, her or you? You
look kind of “captive” yourself. While you’re spending every waking hour
obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn’t even know you
exist. Get off my property or I’ll call the cops.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The cops? The cops read my column to know who
to bust. We’re the only watchdog the public has. None of this is going
away. We’ll be here tomorrow and the day after that. Until you slip up.
And you will. You are looking at your shadow. Because all these
elaborate precautions with Simone – every instinct in my body tells me,
it’s not natural.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m just trying to help you, Sayer. I don’t
want you to be disappointed. It gets cold out here at night.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nice try. If we can’t get to her through you,
maybe your family will be more co-operative. I can guarantee you,
Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get
acquainted.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’d like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: – The rumor is, Simone is holed up in
Taransky’s Malibu home – so far we haven’t seen so much as a glimpse
–</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Honey, I’m really sorry about all this. I
don’t know if it’s safe for you to stay the weekends… just until things
settle down.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Okay, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: If anyone asks about Simone –</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: – I know, I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Exactly. Don’t you wonder where I’m really
hiding Simone?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I’m sure you’d tell me if you thought it was
important.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Sorry I didn’t get her back in time.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No problem. Do you want to come in?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Hey, Vik.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hello – Kent.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor, we simply have to talk about
“Eternity…”</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: “Forever”.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Whatever. I still haven’t received Simone’s
script notes.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: There aren’t any. If the filmmakers are
happy, Simone’s happy. She considers herself an… “instrument”.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Really? Oh, so she’s really going to do all
this nudity?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: If it’s on the page…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, something has to be done about this
budget. It’s completely unrealistic. You allowed nothing for limousine
service.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’ll drive herself.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hair and make-up?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’ll do her own. Theater training.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She was in the theater? When? Where?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’ll send you her resume.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Al least a contingency for wardrobe. Any
woman can go up a dress size.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – I guarantee she won’t gain an once. She’s
very disciplined.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, we have to do something about this –
“stuntwoman”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: There isn’t one.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No need. She does all her own stunts.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Even the fall from the plane?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Even the fall from the plane.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, shoot it on the last day.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: As I’ve tried to explain to you, Elaine.
Simone isn’t like any other actress you’ve ever known. She’s about the
work and only the work – lives for the work. She wants all the money up
there… … on the screen where it belongs. She’d work for scale except I
know you only respect people you pay a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Which accounts for your percentage. When do
I get to meet this dream?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Not today. She’s learning her lines. You can
also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’ll walk you out.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Listen, Viktor… I want to talk to you now,
not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife. Second ex-wife. You got
lucky this last time but you need to be careful. We both know you
wouldn’t be making this overblown art film of you hadn’t convinced
Simone to be in it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor,
director, but Viktor, ex husband… what the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Experience, Viktor. I’ve seen this a hundred
times – young stars destroying the very people who discovered them. I’m
worried about you, that’s all. This woman – she controls your
destiny.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Simone does not control my destiny.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor, I have a feeling. One of my
feelings. There’s something about her I don’t trust.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thanks for taking me back, Mr. Taransky. I
know it looked like I sided with the studio, but I always believed in
you, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Don’t worry. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: seated around a They’re all here.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I can’t tell you how delighted I am to have
this wonderful cast assembled for “Eternity Forever”. Thank you all.
Now, a reminder – as a condition for working on this film, you will not
be rehearsing with Simone, shooting with Simone and you are forbidden
from contacting Simone in any way at any time, whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: How will you do our love scenes?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Body double.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: For her?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: For you. I want you to know, Simone
appreciates you all working for scale. But why am I thanking you? Simone
can thank you herself. She insisted on speaking with you before filming
begins. She’s on the line now.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Simone, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>lotus</strong>: So are we, Simone!</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Why don’t you leave me alone with my
co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we can get to know each other better?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Of course. I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Hi. Who’s there? Don’t be shy. Introduce
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’m Mac. I turned down a Bertolucci film to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>lotus</strong>: My name’s Lotus. God, I can’t believe I’m
talking to you. We’re going to become such great friends.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m Hal. Wonderful to be working together…
again.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Is that everyone…? Well, obviously, as you
know…</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: … I’m Simone.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Obviously. Who else?</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: I just want to start by apologizing
for my “process” –</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: – No. No. I’m completely simpatico. On my last
film I was playing a schizophrenic so I made them give me two dressing
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: So committed.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Well thank you for your understanding. I
know it’s an unusual way to work but I just find I relate better to
people when they’re not actually there.</p>
<p><strong>lotus</strong>: Of course, of course.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I don’t have much to say except that I know
it’s going to be a great project, if we all just trust Mr. Taransky’s
vision. Always do what Mr. Taransky says. If in doubt, do it the
Taransky way.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I know we’re going to make a wonderful movie
together.</p>
<p><strong>lotus</strong>: Wonderful movie.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Together, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Mr. Taransky…</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No one goes in there.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Oh, I know.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: If it’s not too much trouble. Could
you…?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Of course…</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: This last year I was… going through some
things. Awful, awful… things. But when I saw Simone in “Sunrise”… what
she did… in the scene in the fireworks factory… … suddenly everything
made sense. My friends, family, doctors – nobody could reach me – but
Simone, she really… spoke to me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’ll be happy to sign it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Cut! Cut!… Cut!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hal, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone
in this scene! He has to touch her. He has to!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Absolutely not!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: But she’s right there! I must feel her!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: There’s… a wall between you –</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: – an emotional wall, I know. That’s why –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – No. No. A real wall. his hands within the
You ran right through it.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: How did the wall get there?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I can’t explain it to you now – you’ll see
when it’s all put together. Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.
Let’s move on.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: – What you don’t understand, Clyde, is that
love is like a wild flower, but that flower only grows –</p>
<p><strong>joy sadness fear</strong>: elated melancholy anxious jubilant
tearful frightened giddy weeping petrified ecstatic blubbering loss of
bladder inebriated Kevorkian control</p>
<p><strong>contemplation innocence sensuality</strong>: reflective
chaste seductive thoughtful virtuous lustful meditative angelic bestial
stoic Madonna Madonna bored out of her skull</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Let’s take it down a notch.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: – What you don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I like it. But still too big. Smaller
teardrops next time.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s not working. It’s not alive. Let’s try
it again.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: – What you don’t understand, Clyde, is that
love is like a wild flower, but that flower only grows on the edge… … of
a very high cliff.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Perfect, Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m only sorry you still have to work with
flesh and blood for the time being – as user friendly as you are, even I
can’t manufacture an entire cast.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: We are going to have to change our plans,
Simone – you have no idea what an affect your performance is having on
people. We can’t stop now. There’s too much to say – these films they
speak, they speak to the human condition. We’re changing lives. No,
revealing the truth now would be too cruel. Anyway, when you’re seeking
a greater truth – in the work – you are not so concerned with the lesser
truths along the way.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: You’re going to get in a lot of
trouble, Mr. Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Why do you have to bring that up? There’s
always risk – life’s a risk. It’s worth it. Besides, how could something
so lovely be a crime? Well, I think we’ve done enough for today. You’ve
been cooped up in there too long. How about you and me go out on the
town? They’re expecting us.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m checking in a special guest… … Miss
Enomis.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Miss Enomis, yes.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Miss Enomis demands her privacy. You will
switch off all surveillance cameras. I will escort Miss Enomis to her
room alone via the rear exit. She will require no help with her luggage.
She does not wish to be disturbed at any time for any reason. She will
be departing for a function tonight at eight sharp. I’m sure I can rely
on your discretion. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Oh, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: It’s… Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Not yet. Where’s “Matinee”? There they are.
Okay, I think everyone’s here. Now!</p>
<p><strong>photographer 1</strong>: Simone!</p>
<p><strong>echo photographer</strong>: Over here, sweetheart!</p>
<p><strong>photographer 3</strong>: Come one Simone, take it off,
baby!</p>
<p><strong>photographer 4</strong>: We got a job to do!</p>
<p><strong>photographer 1</strong>: I think I got a piece of her
ear.</p>
<p><strong>echo photographer</strong>: I didn’t get shit.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Ten feet from a living Goddess…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Leave me for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: his eyes from her Thank God for you, Faith.
I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in. You
don’t know what a service you’re performing for Simone – shielding her
from those animals.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky. How many
men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You understand you’ll have to come back to
my place to keep them off the, er… … scent.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You look so, so…</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: … so much like her?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your
own right.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I do find myself physically attracted to you,
Mr. Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Do whatever you do to Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: What?… What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Do what you do to Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: What I do to Simone?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Yes, call me Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Simone?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Yes, yes, again, again. Do what you do to
Simone. I want to know what it’s like to be her just for one night.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’re with me to be close to her?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Is that a problem?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: “Why are we here? Is that what you’re asking,
Jack?… Why are we here? No why. Just here”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Please put your clothes on</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood Foreign
Press is going to eat this up.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Thank you. What did you think, Lainey?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: One thing bothered me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I know, Hal is as stiff as always.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: No, not that. I was just wondering – in the
bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she
walked in front of that mirror?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I wondered if you’d spot that. You’ve got a
good eye, Lainey. I’m proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I got them to remove the reflection. The
mirror’s metaphor – to show how her character’s inwardly dead.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That’s genius, Viktor. Was that Simone’s
idea?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Who else? It’s always Simone’s idea.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in
reel six?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Good-night, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Night, Lainey.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Elaine, I don’t know if it’s a good idea for
Lainey to come to the screenings – mature content and all that.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Maybe you’re right. Twelve years after your
daughter’s born you decide to become a father.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Better late than never.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I should fire you more often. The film’s
looking wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes. To be honest I never quite saw this
film before – maybe it’s the way Simone is playing it – but what it’s
saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that’s the
only way we can love – I think it’s really going to mean something.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Thank you. I’ll tell Simone you liked
it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’d love to tell her myself. When are you
going to let me meet her?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Soon. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Everyone you know is lying.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Damnit!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You know how you can stop that. She has to
get out more. See you at the premiere.</p>
<p><strong>premiere reporter 1</strong>: – What a night! Anyone who’s
anyone is here at the premiere of “Eternity Forever,” but waiting for
Simone to show may take even longer. We do have her director, Viktor
Taransky. Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You know Simone.</p>
<p><strong>premiere reporter 2</strong>: I hope she does show up. Some
of her fans got here at dawn. We don’t want to disappoint them.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Well, I’m sure they’re going to love the
movie. I got the inspiration –</p>
<p><strong>premiere reporter 2</strong>: Harry! Harry! Can we have a
minute? What brings you here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just came out to support my good friend,
Simone.</p>
<p><strong>premiere reporter 2</strong>: There’s a rumor that you’re
more than just “good friends”?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’ve been seeing each other, sure, but we’d
rather keep our relationship private.</p>
<p><strong>premiere reporter 2</strong>: Do I hear the sound of… wedding
bells?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I can’t believe you people! No wonder she
never comes to these things!</p>
<p><strong>mover/shaker</strong>: Elaine! The picture is a
revelation!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Thank you. I mean, it was a team effort
–</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Is she here?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m fine, Hal. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Somebody said she was here.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Oh my God, that’s her glass! Jack Daniels,
straight-up. She is my kind of woman.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Viktor, where is she?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’s around.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: to the far side of the Jesus, Hal… she’s in the
Ladies Room.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You know I sometimes forget she has bodily
functions.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I have to talk to her about my experimental
film. It’s very… experimental.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Is that her? – By the fountain.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No. In fact, between us, she doesn’t really
exist.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Simone!</p>
<p><strong>guest 1</strong>: – Simone’s here!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – When did she arrive? Why didn’t someone
tell me?</p>
<p><strong>guest 2</strong>: – Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: – She’s by the fountain.</p>
<p><strong>guest 3</strong>: – Simone, over here!</p>
<p><strong>guest 4</strong>: – Simone!</p>
<p><strong>lookalike woman</strong>: Simone!</p>
<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: – Forget “Eternity Forever”,
the big news tonight was the surprise appearance of Simone. Even these
seen-it-all superstars are apparently not immune to Simone fever and the
resulting stampede forced organizers to bring the event to an early end.
I spoke with some of the departing guests about their encounter with
Hollywood’s most reluctant superstar.</p>
<p><strong>executive 3</strong>: – I would say, even more beautiful in
person, you have to see her to believe her.</p>
<p><strong>male guest 1</strong>: – I can’t reveal what we spoke about.
It was… personal. Simone and I go back a long way.</p>
<p><strong>female guest 1</strong>: – When she talks to you, for that
moment, you are the only other human being in the room.</p>
<p><strong>female guest 2</strong>: – I really don’t know what the fuss
is about. So over-rated. She’s done one film. Talk to me when she’s had
the kind of career I’ve had.</p>
<p><strong>male guest 2</strong>: – I do expect her to be nominated,
yes.</p>
<p><strong>entertainment reporter</strong>: Fortunately, Simone was not
amongst the injured and was spirited away as mysteriously as she
arrived.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: – She goes to a major, Hollywood, A-list party
and we don’t get an interview, a comment, we don’t even get a
photograph? Is that what you’re telling me?</p>
<p><strong>echo photographer</strong>: Nobody got a photograph. Nobody
ever gets a photograph.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: We’ve got our best people on it,
Mr. Sayer.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: 24-hour tail on Taransky?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Shutter bugs camped outside any place he
goes, every concierge and maitre d’ on the take. But this Simone woman
is good.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: “Confidential” FBI Obviously the name isn’t
real – she’s using an assumed identity, travels under a false name,
checks into hotels with an alias. She never stays in the same place two
nights in a row. Anything on the satellite photos? What about the
fingerprints? What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Well, we got some of Taransky’s
fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints… but none of hers.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Which means they’re significant. Incriminating.
Perhaps, criminal. She’s hiding her past. She’s hiding her past.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Of course – no one’s that perfect, that pure.
You know I had something on Mother Teresa. But then she died and it
wasn’t worth it anymore. I know how to flush out this Simone – a
tell-all story from her childhood.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: My God, you’ve got one?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I will when you’re finished writing it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to
protect her privacy, she’ll have to appear in a public courtroom to do
it.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Long live the First Amendment.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get
to the bigger truth. As for a photo – if you can’t do it, I know twelve
million people who can.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – You can’t go in there!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – We have to talk to her, Viktor!</p>
<p><strong>executive 1</strong>: – We know she’s in there!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – Why? What’s all this about?</p>
<p><strong>executive 2</strong>: – We’ve got the tracking numbers for
“Eternity Forever”.</p>
<p><strong>executive 3</strong>: – They’re in the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – She has to get out there and sell the
film.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – What do you want her to do, go
door-to-door – ?</p>
<p><strong>executive 1</strong>: – Even Garbo would be on the talk show
circuit if she was alive today.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – It’s precisely because she doesn’t crave
the limelight that people love her. I told you, she’s only about the
work.</p>
<p><strong>executive 3</strong>: – This is over-shadowing the work!</p>
<p><strong>executive 2</strong>: That’s the problem. She’s more famous
for her no-shows than her shows.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – It’s starting to look like she doesn’t
support the film or you, Viktor. If you can’t handle her, I will.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Not now. She’s emotional. Her mother dies
today. Scene forty-two of “Good For Nothing”. It’s not a good time.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No! Please, don’t go in there!</p>
<p><strong>executive 1</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>executive 2</strong>: She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Elaine… I…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: So, the secret’s finally out, Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – I don’t think that’s necessary. I think
it’s perfectly clear. I should have guessed – it all makes sense now…
it’s why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She’s into computers.</p>
<p><strong>executive 1</strong>: Probably spends her whole life in chat
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>executive 2</strong>: It’s the one place she can be
herself.</p>
<p><strong>executive 3</strong>: Anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s worse than you think. She’s extremely
agoraphobic – has a morbid fear of people and germs. In a way I’m
relieved you… found out.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: The premiere was the first time I’ve
convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor, you should have said something.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She doesn’t want pity.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’re so good to protect her like this.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’ll tell you what. I know how much this
means to you. I’ll try to get her to plug the film. I’m not promising
anything but maybe she’ll do a talk show – taped.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh, make it live – please, Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’ll try. Maybe live but remote. She’ll
never go to them.</p>
<p><strong>executive 1</strong>: We understand. Thank you, Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>executive 2</strong>: Give her our best.</p>
<p><strong>executive 1</strong>: That agoraphobia – it’s like a
plague.</p>
<p><strong>executive 2</strong>: It’s out of control in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to introduce
you to Simone at the premiere. There wasn’t time with the riot and
everything. But she wanted you to have this.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She was there. She didn’t by any chance
happen to mention me?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She said you were very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would
you like to go somewhere – dinner?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’d love to. But aren’t you supposed to meet
up with Simone?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Oh, yes. Of course. Don’t I always?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She likes Apple Jacks… just like me…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Mr. Sayer…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What do you want – ?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks
yet?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: – Cashier’s check went out to our anonymous
tipster this morning – worth every penny too. Who says there’s no place
for checkbook journalism? We’ll be running stills of this for months,
then release the whole tape – we’ll get our money back – maybe show it
on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We
have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: We used to.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: L.A. Times Calendar She’s doing Frank Brand
on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Tonight on Frank Brand Live –</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: – Since taking the nation by storm with
her debut movie, “Sunrise, Sunset”…</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: … no one’s managed to land a live TV
interview with the fabulous, new shooting starlet, Simone… until
now.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Make up your mind, Viktor. Make up
your mind.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: I’m happy to say she’s agreed to join
us tonight from the set of her new film. Welcome, Simone.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Wonderful to be with you, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: She is all woman.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Well, no one could accuse you of being
over-exposed, Simone. Why have you stayed so completely out of the
limelight?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I just think actors talk too much. Does the
world really want to hear your life story just because you’ve got a
movie opening Friday?</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Of course, the only problem with shying
away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Don’t I know it. That’s the only reason I’m
here now – to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky’s
film.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: You don’t secretly want the
attention?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’m not even sure I deserve it. After
tonight I’ll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my
movies. How is that healthy for a performer?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Because, you have to understand, Frank,
these interviews – none of this is real. Who I am on screen and who I
really am are two totally different people.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Who are you really?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: That’s a good question. As Nietzsche said,
“Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else…”</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: “… he ends up finding it is difficult to be
himself again.”</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Well put.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know where that is… I know…</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Change of topic. Simone, you’ve been
romantically linked to dozens of men in the press – Mick Jagger, Stephen
Hawking, Fidel Castro… and most recently Viktor Taransky. Is there a
Mr. Right in there somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’d rather not discuss my private life. But
Viktor and I are inseparable.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: You dog, Viktor!</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I literally wouldn’t be here today without
him.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Would you like a moment, Simone?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: No, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Let’s talk about the work that you care
so much about.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Sure. Where would you like to start?</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: How about the nudity?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Nudity has just never been an issue for me,
Frank. For me, clothes are just an option.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: What exactly was it that attracted you
to your first two projects?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I suppose the thing I like most about the
movies I’m in is that they’re not about special effects.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: They’re better for it if I may say.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: Well, we appear to be experiencing
satellite difficulties. In case we lose you, Simone, I want to thank you
–</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Thank… YOU, FRANK.</p>
<p><strong>viktor / simone</strong>: Hel–</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – Viktor, are you with her? Is she
there?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you and Simone… … getting married?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No, of course not! significance of the Why?
Would you care if we were?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it
would be better if Simone stayed single. Anyhow, I thought she came
across great tonight. Intelligent, well informed, a natural. And
touching. She was spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor, do you realize you always do
that?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the
credit.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes, you do… Anyway, tonight was a good
start.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Excuse me? Start?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s a crowded summer. We need every
photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night,
Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Mom, do you miss Dad?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Sometimes. But, just when I think your
father’s changing for the better, I realize he’s as self absorbed as
ever. He took the credit for Simone tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I think Dad deserves more credit than he
gets.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Will you cover yourself up!?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: – I’ve been here before! – On my honeymoon with
my ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Is that why she left you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You see, that’s the exact same tree and in the
distance, there’s the… … mountain.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’s a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Could they have built that hotel since
yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – We don’t do the photo shoot, you don’t get
the cover… written answers to written questions, that’s right… website
interviews, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You want exposure, Elaine? I’ll give you
over-exposure…</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I think “Eternity Forever” is my finest
work.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’m most proud of my work in “Eternity
Forever”.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I think people are going to love “Eternity
Forever”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Forgive me, Simone.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Of course, being a movie star is wonderful,
but I have so many other ways I want to express myself –</p>
<p><strong>“human</strong>: KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE”</p>
<p><strong>patsy cline, ella fitzgerald, aretha franklin, janice
joplin,</strong>: CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc. Beneath the
title of each song is a graphic representation of the music – “PITCH”
and “RESONANCE”.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nice boat, Taransky.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s a yacht.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know what you’re up to.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I don’t have time for this, Sayer.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think you do. print of Simone in the I know
it’s a fake.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Got your attention now?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s bogus. You used an old library shot for
the background.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: The background is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She was never in New Mexico. She never left the
studio.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: bundle of other shots I’ve done my homework.
I’ve studied her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – I bet you have.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: – I’ve looked at every piece of publicity she’s
ever done, the video in the supermarket, there’s no evidence she’s ever
left the studio. Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper
trail. But I have “obtained” a copy of your bank accounts. I know you
have power of attorney but so far you haven’t transferred one single
solitary cent to her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m keeping it in trust.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know that’s what you’d like us to believe.
But I got to tell you – embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention
abduction.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Abduction?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t buy the whole recluse scam. How are you
doing it? What is it – drugs? Blackmail? Mind-control? All three? What
do you do – keep her locked in a box somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: What is it exactly you want, Sayer?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I want to see her. Unless you show me Simone
live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Alright, Sayer, you’ve got a deal.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Er,… good.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: All ready, Mr. Taransky. This time
tomorrow night, she’ll be standing right here in front of a packed
house. We could have sold it out twenty times.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Soundcheck went perfect. Laser show
ready to go. I gotta say, you ordered an awful lot of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: That’s the way she likes it.</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: After what you told us about the death
threats, the security guards are under strict instructions never to take
their eyes off the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Simone wanted you to have these.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Wish her luck from us.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Oh, I will. Remember, no cameras, no
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Let’s get you into hair and make up.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Easier to make one hundred thousand believe
than just one.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky
Promotions is proud to present, live on stage, for the debut concert of
the “Splendid Isolation” tour, the one, the only,</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I love you…</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: It’s great to be here.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I don’t know about you, Simone, but I’ve
never felt more alive.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Good-night. Never stop believing.</p>
<p><strong>fan 1</strong>: – I swear, she looked right at me.</p>
<p><strong>fan 2</strong>: – She was, like, ethereal.</p>
<p><strong>fan 3</strong>: – One moment she seemed to walk right through
her mike stand like it wasn’t even there.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I said I didn’t want to be interrupt –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: My two favorite girls.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Lainey and I just wanted to
congratulate…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: … Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’s lying down. She’s exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Thank Simone for the tickets.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: It was a great show, Dad…</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Where are you… going?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I can’t believe she’s doing this – taking
advantage of him this way. It’s cruel.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Obviously, this can’t last. She’s going to
dump him. Viktor won’t be able to take that. He’s too sensitive. It’ll
destroy him.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: Elaine, do you realize you can’t stop talking
about Viktor?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I have to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>kent</strong>: I’ve been meaning to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Hey, Lainey. How’s your love life?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I do okay. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You know me – married to my work.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Dad, you know I don’t like to get between
you and mom but she’s feeling down right now. She broke up with
Kent.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Really? Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: She thinks you’re with Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Lainey, you know Simone and I don’t have a
real relationship.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I know but Mom doesn’t. Maybe if it came
from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom – she could straighten things out.
Dinner, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Dinner? Dinner’s difficult. A phone
call?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Too impersonal. They have to meet
face-to-face.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’ll see what I can do. You know, Lainey. I
don’t believe you’ve ever once asked to meet Simone. Don’t you like
her?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I love her but that doesn’t mean I need to
meet her.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Why? So I can tell my friends at school – as
if that validates my life somehow. What’s Simone going to say to a
fourteen-year-old anyhow? She’s going to be polite because you’re my
father but we’re not suddenly going to become friends – we have nothing
in common. It’s not going to be real. Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
my head every day. Why kill the dream? What do they say, “don’t get too
close to your idols, they always disappoint you”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I love you, Lainey.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I love you too, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: That’s Mom. See you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Hello, is this Elaine?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes – oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I’ve
been wanting to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Well, here I am. You look pretty today. Red
suits you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor’s
car.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: I’d love to stop somewhere but I’m
late. I’m on my way to see Viktor now.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, I understand. That’s what I want to talk
about. I don’t know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were
married once.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: I can’t imagine how you ever let a
man like that go. I owe Viktor everything.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I think he owes more to you. But that’s not
important now. I know what’s going on between you two.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: I want to reassure you, Elaine,
there’s absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You don’t have to protect my feelings,
Simone. I don’t blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable
woman in the world.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: I’m not – He’s not.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: My God, are you alright, Simone?</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Damn – Yes – I – – I’m just a
little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I – it’s strictly a working
relationship. We could never be anything else. We’re just so…
different.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Exactly. You’re a household name now. You’re
moving in entirely different worlds. That’s why I hope you’re not toying
with Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: It sounds like you still have
feelings for him.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: We have a daughter together. I just don’t
want to see Viktor get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: I don’t know how many times I have
to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love. I only make love
to the camera.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Simone, I recognize the shirt you’re
wearing. I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Christ – Elaine, I know how it
looks but… … it would mean a lot to Viktor if you’d go with him to the
Oscars. If you won’t do it for him, please do it for me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Okay – for you.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Thanks. This is my exit so, I –</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m glad we talked.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: You don’t have to explain. I know what
the press is like. Lunatics. Out of control. You do know I’m going to
have to take this?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: And the winner is…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Actually, there’s a tie.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: The winners are… Simone for “Sunrise,
Sunset”…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: … and Simone for “Eternity Forever”.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Unfortunately, Simone can’t be with us tonight.
But thanks to the miracle of modern technology she is able to join us
live via satellite from the location of her new film.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Thank you! Thank you! This means so much to
me. I’m just sorry I can’t be there with you. First off I have to
acknowledge my fellow nominees – I don’t even feel I belong in the best
actress category let alone with these… wonderful human beings. I also
have to thank my co-stars, the studio, of course. But most of all, I
have to thank the audience for supporting what I do – you’re the only
reason I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Why didn’t she thank you?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She did… didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: … And of course I must thank my
collaborator, Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be
possible.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s written right there… Why didn’t I say
it?… How could I forget to say it?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: What now, Sayer?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Viktor noticing the Looks familiar, doesn’t
she? No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough
rocks…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I traced her to a nursing home. A young woman
fitting Simone’s description dropped her off five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She looks a lot like you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She hasn’t uttered a word that whole time –
until she saw the big show.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: My baby… My baby…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who would think that “Saint Simone” would
abandon her own mother? I’ve been looking into the family history –
heartbreaking. Most likely a biography to run over four issues… who
knows, maybe there’s a Pulitzer in there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: My baby… My baby…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That doesn’t prove a thing – wait until I get a
court order for a blood test.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: That won’t be necessary. Sooner or later I
knew you’d crack this thing, Max. You got me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I do? Sure I do. Can we speak off the record?
I’m a fair man. I’m willing to sit down with her and tell her side of
the story.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I wouldn’t want you to compromise your
ethics.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. Thanks. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You love her, don’t you, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: This should take care of Mother.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Happy birthday, Lainey. Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: It’s fantastic – it’s too much.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s the car she drove in “Eternity
Forever”.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I know. Thank her for me.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s from both of us. Of course you’ll have
to drive it around the lot until you get your permit –</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: – I can’t accept it. I don’t want a car,
Dad.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Why not? I can get you something else. What
do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: The old Viktor Taransky. I liked you better
before – before all this. You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had
integrity. I can’t stand to see you like this – clinging to Simone’s
coattails – it used to be about the work, and now it’s all about her.
And then she’s not even grateful enough to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No, that was me.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: There you go again, blaming yourself. Can’t
you see what she’s done to you – she’s taking advantage, mocking you.
You deserve better than Simone. I’ve got to go, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Lainey…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Ready for your casting session?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Nicola’s here for the role of Simone’s
sister.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: A lot’s happened since we last saw each
other.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: I never apologized properly for what
happened on “Sunrise”.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Thank you. It’s not important.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: After I saw what Simone did with the role –
you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes,
changed my whole look. She really inspired me.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: Would you like me to read?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes, I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: opposition to her amorous – Who do you think
you are, Carlos – coming in here like this? With my husband sleeping in
the next room. Do you think I won’t call out? Do you think I will just
give in to you without a fight – like the last time and the time before
that? I wish you were dead. I wish we were both dead.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You know you’re really very good. I take
back what I said. I mean, you’re really good.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You could play the lead.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: But that’s Simone’s part.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes, of course it is. You know you have a
line here. Not a wrinkle. Actually, more of a dimple. I’ve been thinking
of incorporating something like that in Simone.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: You’d cosmetically alter Simone to look like
me?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No, of course not, you’re right. That would
be crazy.</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: Do you want me to do it again?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – Oh sure, she comes in all the time… we’ve
become close. She told me –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Jane –</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m leaving early tonight. If you need me
I’ll be at the beach house having dinner with a… certain someone.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: … Elaine Christian please.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Viktor, I’m picking up Lainey.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Elaine, it’s Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Is it Wednesday? It’s Wednesday. How
embarrassing. I don’t know what I was thinking. With all the excitement
lately… Am I interrupting something? Are you expecting company?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: As a matter-of-fact I am.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: When is she coming over?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: About now. Would you like a drink?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I suppose I could stay, just until she
arrives.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Is Simone back to earth yet?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sure you’ll keep her focussed. She’s
lucky to have you, Viktor. Is she really having your baby?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I just read somewhere –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I know. I know. They’ll say anything.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – And she was positively glowing at the
awards. I should be going, she’ll be here soon –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – She already is. Simone’s not coming over,
Elaine. Not tonight, not ever. I want you back, Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I want you back too, Viktor.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: This is crazy. Who am I fooling? I can’t
compete with Simone. What woman can?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I would rather have you than Simone. Believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That’s sweet, Viktor, but I couldn’t let you
do that – make that kind of sacrifice. It’s strange. I’ve stabbed people
in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am – it goes with the
territory – but, for some reason, I can’t betray Simone. There’s… I
don’t know any other way to say it – there’s a goodness to her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No, there isn’t. There’s nothing to her.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh, Viktor. You say that now – because we’re
here, alone, like this. But in the morning, you’d go back to her. What
man wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No, I will end my relationship with her –
totally.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: But you don’t understand. She’ll always be
there – at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio,
up on some screen.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No. She’ll never work again – retire, never
make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Of course she will. Her public will demand
it.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Not if I don’t let her.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I’m going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.
Simone is not a real person. I invented her.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Every actor is an invention, Viktor. Don’t
embarrass yourself. No one’s denying that you discovered Simone. But
it’s like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but
it’s not the finder who sparkles.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – No, no, I didn’t trip over her. You don’t
understand –</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: – You just got lucky that she’s loyal enough
to stay with you. Maybe she’s staying out of pity, who knows? She
certainly doesn’t need you. Some people even say you’re holding her
back.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Who says that – ? – Never mind. You have to
listen to me, Elaine. Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a
mathematical equation. I inherited it from a madman – I can show you
–</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: How much wine have you had?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – She’s a figment of my own imagination. I,
Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest
sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment
history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I’ve done –
even you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’re drunker than I thought. Are you doing
that again?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No! Whatever talent Simone has comes from me
– me! Me! I swear, as God is my judge. You don’t know what I’ve been
through. Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that
screen, nights without end, and look what it’s cost me. Why do you think
I’ve been wearing these? I may have done irreparable harm to my
eyesight, and why? To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human
being – a human soul. Don’t you see? I made Simone!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You made Simone? Viktor, she made you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You bitch! I’ll destroy you!</p>
<p><strong>woman 1</strong>: Disgusting…</p>
<p><strong>woman 2</strong>: She must have been so desperate to do
something like that, so depraved.</p>
<p><strong>woman 1</strong>: I’m still naming my baby after her.</p>
<p><strong>woman 2</strong>: You’re having a boy.</p>
<p><strong>woman 1</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>film critic</strong>: For Simone to do something as brave as
“I AM PIG” at this point in her career, with so much to lose – all I can
say is, “I Am Pig, I Am Oscar”.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Simone, that’s a rather controversial
position.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I just think all elementary schools should
have a firing range – so students can learn how to defend themselves. We
could fit it inbetween recess and American History.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: If there’s a hole in the ozone layer why
can’t I see it?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Immigration?! God, isn’t it crowded
enough?!</p>
<p><strong>hosts</strong>: Just as we always knew. Simone’s not like
other celebrities. She speaks her mind!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’s trying to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>hank aleno</strong>: Remembered Virtually Forever</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: They’re plastic, Hank. I know that’s the way
you’d want it. billboard outside the She killed you, Hank. Now she’s
killing me. She’s a serial killer. the billboard as if But I don’t know
how to stop her. She’s taken on a life of her own. I can’t just come
clean – make some confession. I’ve defrauded millions – they’d turn on
me. And I can’t put the genie back in the bottle. If she stopped working
– dropped out of sight, they’d never let it rest. I’ve tried to kill her
career but they like her even more. What am I going to do, Hank?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Don’t say another word, Hank. You are truly
a genius.</p>
<p><strong>simone / viktor</strong>: What’s the matter, Viktor? You look
so sad. Don’t you love me anymore?… It’s over, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It’s the only way, Simone. If it’s any
consolation, you’re going to live on in the public’s heart like all the
other tragic figures that went before their time. There’s no love like
posthumous love.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I know what you’re thinking. It’s a
phoney-baloney world. The women are surgically enhanced, the athletes
are on steroids, the singers are lip-syncing if they’re even singing at
all, the news is entertainment, the politicians are bought and paid for
– we’re living one big lie. So why shouldn’t you live too? You’re more
authentic than the people who adore you. And that’s the problem. You’re
looking at the real fraud. I told myself this was all about the work but
if that was the truth, it wouldn’t matter to me – and it does. It wasn’t
that the artists had no respect for the art. They had no respect for me.
Someone like you, you have so much love showered on you – I just wanted
to feel one tiny drop on my face. I’m sorry, Simone. Here I’ve been
trying to convince the world that you exist, but I was really trying to
convince them that I exist. It’s not that you aren’t human, Simone, it’s
that I am.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It is my sad and solemn duty to announce the
tragic passing of Simone.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: No!! What happened?! Oh. God.</p>
<p><strong>press reporter 1</strong>: mustering the courage to How did
she die?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: A rare virus. On her goodwill tour of the
third world.</p>
<p><strong>press reporter 2</strong>: Did she suffer?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Mercifully, it was quick.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Can I see you later – go away for the
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: How can you bring that up at a time like
this?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: – I heard him say, “Die bitch”.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: – He was a controlling madman, she was a
prisoner. I blame myself… I should have done more to stop it…</p>
<p><strong>nicola</strong>: – It was strange. He wanted to replace her
with me in his new movie… and I know I’m not that good.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: – Forgive me, Mr. Taransky. I’m just
trying to understand. All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers,
internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood –
all fake. This is fake, this is fake – fake, fake, fake, all fake.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: That’s right. You understand perfectly. I
will confess to fraud, not murder.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: A fan club with a worldwide membership in
the millions – also bogus?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Oh, no. The fan club is real. But they were
worshipping computer code – ones and zeros.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: So, of course, you couldn’t kill Simone
because there never was a Simone.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so
much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently
dead – perhaps the “man” you claim helped invent Simone is an invention
himself?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: But not everyone’s imaginary, are they,
Mr. Taransky? I refer, of course, to Edith.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: The woman you admitted to a journalist is
Simone’s mother and for whose silence you paid a fortune? Is she not
flesh to you – are her tears not wet?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: My BABY!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: She’s insane! This whole thing is insane!
There is no Simone. Look! Even her name is fake. It’s not Simone. It’s
SIM… ONE! Simulation One!</p>
<p><strong>detective 2</strong>: You really hated her, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Perhaps you could explain this to me,
Mr. Taransky – or is this tape “doctored” too?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: It’s footage from the marina’s
closed-circuit camera on the night in question. Altered, of course. Is
that really what you expect us to believe, Mr. Taransky?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Can you tell us why you were disposing of
the body of a woman who didn’t exist?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It wasn’t her body. It was her body of
work.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Why don’t you just come clean, Viktor?
Tell the truth. You’ll feel better afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I am telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: We all know what happened. In a fit of
jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought
for you.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No!! I can prove it to you. I’ll take you to
her.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Did you find anything else – drivers, discs…
disc-drives?</p>
<p><strong>diver 1</strong>: Nothing. We couldn’t stay down any
longer.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: – Plead guilty and throw yourself on the
mercy of the court. It’s the best deal you’re going to get.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I could get the death penalty.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: You certainly will if you go to trial – a
jury in this kind of ugly mood. You’ve killed an icon, for God’s
sake.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: I didn’t kill anyone, Bernard, there was no
one to kill!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: An insanity defence.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Let’s go, Lainey. There’s nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: God, it’s so like your father. Why can’t
people take responsibility for their actions anymore? I can almost
forgive him for killing Simone – but denying her existence. I can never
forgive that.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Because obviously she existed, right?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I know it as surely as you’re sitting here,
sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: So you did meet her?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Of course. What are you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I mean really meet her – in the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: I know it’s embarrassing to admit it, mom,
but when I think about it – honestly, I haven’t. I mean, it feels like I
have. I know more about her than members of my own family. She’s even in
my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV
appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the
internet. I’ve never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in
her physical presence. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: – We don’t believe daddy because we don’t
want to believe we were taken in too.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Lainey, there’s no evidence that Simone
isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Listen to what you’re saying, mom. Is there
any evidence she is?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: There’s one part of dad’s story that may
have been true. Simone may have contracted a virus.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Certain viruses can be cured.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: to a thick Psychiatric … Listen, I’ve found
a psychiatrist in Ventura – well respected – who’s willing to testify
under oath that you have diminished capacity due to the trauma of your
divorce, ten years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on
the head you sustained as a child –</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: – No! I can’t go along with this horseshit!
Just tell them they can fry me!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: It was premeditated – I knew exactly what I
was doing! I strangled her! I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire! I did
it! I killed her!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I think you’d better see this.</p>
<p><strong>vbc anchor</strong>: – Breaking news – international media
star, Simone, is alive and well. Her studio released this footage only
minutes ago…</p>
<p><strong>vbc anchor</strong>: … Simone reading today’s edition of the
L.A. Times. Who says, “The only bad publicity is your obituary”? Details
at the top of the hour.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: You’re indestructible.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I’ll never get you Hollywood people.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Thank you! I don’t know how you did it but
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Don’t thank us too fast, Viktor. You know
what we have to do?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Why stop at one character when you can have
a whole cast?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind
you, we can really do things.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I was thinking – what about you and…
“Simone” moving back in with me and Lainey?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: That sounds wonderful. How do you feel about
all this, Lainey?</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: About you and mom?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Me and Simone. What I did.</p>
<p><strong>lainey</strong>: Your mistake wasn’t making something fake,
daddy. We’re fine with fake – as long as you don’t lie about it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Don’t look so glum, Viktor. It’s not a death
sentence.</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: No… it’s life.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: – Simone, the question on everyone’s
mind is simply… “why?”</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a
fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media…</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: With everything that was going on in my
life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while – I needed time.
Viktor bought me that time. I owe him so much.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: We all do. But now I understand you’re
eager to get back to work – and not the kind of work that we’re all
expecting.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: That’s true. I can reveal that I am
considering a career in politics.</p>
<p><strong>frank brand</strong>: And what may I ask brought this on?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I suppose this little man had something to
do with it. Viktor and I are both concerned about what kind of world our
new son, Chip, is going to grow up in. Aren’t you, Viktor?</p>
<p><strong>viktor</strong>: Yes.</p>
