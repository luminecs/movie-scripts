<p><strong>the sheikh</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the sheikh</strong>: How have you liked your stay?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What I’ve seen…I’ve liked.</p>
<p><strong>the sheikh</strong>: Please to explain, why I should agree to
interview…with pro-Zionist American media?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Because I think Hezbollah is trying to
broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you’re
thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah
does not have a face. That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>the sheikh</strong>: Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity
and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the
interview.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No. We don’t do that. You’ve seen “60
Minutes” and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and
objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected,
TV-magazine news show in America.</p>
<p><strong>the sheikh</strong>: Tell him I will see him day after
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s good. That works. Uh, you know, I
want to ask you something…I know it sounds odd…but…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Hello, Sheikh…? Hello, Sheikh…?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Norman.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Take your blindfold off.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Welcome to the world.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Fluctuating all over the place. Anywhere we
shoot, here, it’s gonna be portable gennies and we’ll run cable…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Mike, it’s me. We’re on…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Hi, honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Hi, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What’s new?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yeah? What for?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: For reading.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: That’s great… Little early for cartoons,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Oh, I didn’t know you were home… It’s early…
Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Gotta take Debbie to ballet…</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Sweetheart, c’mon. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: She was playing with my Pooh doll
again…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Breathe
deep. Breathe deep. Slow down, honey. Slow down. Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: She was playing with the Pooh doll.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Pooh’s dusty, sweetheart…he’s dusty, and you
breathed him in, okay? So what’s - what’s happening to you now is… cells
called mast cells told your lungs “don’t breathe any more of that dust
in.” …and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the
branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you
medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You’re better already, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Can I go to dance tomorrow? I’m better…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: …if you are, then I’ll take Barbara to soccer
and take you to dance after…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I can take her.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Don’t you have to be at the office?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Is there any more rice…?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Yes, it’s on the stove…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’ll take some.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Instant rice…?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Can I go over to Janeane’s house?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I’m sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee
mug…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Try the car.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Uh, what are those boxes?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’m going to the store. You need
anything?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: What do you need at the store?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Soy sauce…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Right now?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: That’s my stuff from the office…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Why did you take your stuff from the
office?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I didn’t want to leave it there…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I got fired this morning… Where else am I
gonna take it?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Why? Who said?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Thomas Sandefur…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: What are we supposed to do…? What about our
medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments?
The payments on this house?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: There’s a severance agreement… It includes
cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage… Sure you don’t
need anything?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the sheikh</strong>: I am very pleased to receive you as my
guest, Mr. Wallace.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Thank you for having us…</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: Norman’s camera crew is setting up. MIKE
WALLACE is there. A dangerous combination of intelligence, arrogance,
and celebrity, there’s a kinetic quality about him.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I think I’ve got a problem with the gennie.
I have to go outside.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Norman…?</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: He says you must not sit so close.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: What? I can’t conduct an interview
from back there.</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: You must move back your chair.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Will you tell him that when I conduct
an interview, I sit anywhere I damn please!</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: There is no interview.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You! I’m talking to you!</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: We’re there.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Good, well ask him if Arabic is his
second language.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Don’t interpret that! Hold it. Hold it. Hold
it! Slow, slow!! Sheikh, do you mind…if you would just turn your chair a
little bit to face Mr. Wallace?</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Are you ready? Or you want to keep fucking
around and warm up some more…?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: No. …that’s got my heart started.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Alright, Todd, give me the three-button on
Mike, please. Okay. We are rolling. Okay, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Sheikh Fadlallah, thank you so much
for seeing us. Are you a terrorist?</p>
<p><strong>the sheikh</strong>: Mr. Wallace, I…am a servant of God.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: A servant of God? Really…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Americans believe that you, as an
Islamic fundamentalist, that you are a leader who contributed to the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …everyone thinks Canadian Mounties ride
horses and rescue ladies from rapids, Mike. They backed locals in Oka in
a fight with Mohawks over building a golf course on their burial site.
They beat up protesters at Kanasake… Where’d you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s Stuart…he’s in Mexico City…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Let me call you back…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah, Stuart… What New York bank?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hey Dad…Sharon…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No classes this morning?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Will he go on-camera and talk about the
Mexico City branch?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t have to be there until ten-
thirty.</p>
<p><strong>josiah</strong>: Hi Mom, Lowell…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hi, sweetheart…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Will independent sources corroborate
that?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hello? Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s son</strong>: Dad, you got a box out here…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Let me see this… No, ’cause I gotta know
where you’re going at all times.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I can’t… I’ve got to fly to Boston
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …“ignition propensity?” …you understand any
of this…?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: …no…this looks like a table of temperatures…
Who’s this from?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …it’s anonymous. References to “P.M.” It’s
got to be Philip Morris, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I have to take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doug oliver</strong>: Hi, this is Doug Oliver…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, hi, Doug…it’s Lowell. I’m doing this
story on fire safety… People burning up from falling asleep smoking. I
received a shitload of scientific papers from inside Philip Morris…
Anonymous. You or anybody in FDA know someone who can translate this
stuff into English for me?</p>
<p><strong>doug oliver</strong>: …uh, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Mr. Wigand, please.</p>
<p><strong>liane’s voice</strong>: Who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: My name’s Lowell Bergman… I’m –</p>
<p><strong>liane’s voice</strong>: Did you say Berman?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, Bergman…B.E.R.G.M.A.N…. I’m a producer
with “60 Minutes”…</p>
<p><strong>liane’s voice</strong>: “60 Minutes”?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>liane’s voice</strong>: “60 Minutes,” the television
show?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: He doesn’t want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: How does he know he doesn’t want to talk to
me? He doesn’t know what I’m calling him about…</p>
<p><strong>liane’s voice</strong>: He doesn’t care to know.</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: This is Lowell Bergman with “60
Minutes”… I’m doing a story on fire safety and cigarettes… I have
scientific documents from a tobacco company, and I could use your help
as a consultant explaining these documents to me… My number is area code
510-555- 0199… I’ll be there, at this number, in 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: If you’re curious to meet me…</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: …I’m gonna be in the lobby of the
Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, reading The New York Times, tomorrow, at
five o’clock…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Have you always lived in Louisville?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Mr. Bergman? What did you want me to consult
about?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s room service. They usually knock
first. Come on in… Over here, please.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: How do you like your coffee? Black?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Black, black…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Look, I really don’t have that much
time…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Is there anything you want to know about me,
Mr. Wigand…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Like what? Your sign?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I know what I have to know.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Just so I know you know, when I talk to
people in confidence, it stays that way.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: How did a radical journalist from Ramparts
Magazine end up at CBS?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I still do the tough stories. “60 Minutes”
reaches a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Let me see the documents…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …this is a Fire-Safety Product Study for
Philip Morris. Burn rates…ignition propensity…things of this nature. I
could very easily explain this to you in layman’s terms, because it’s
from another company…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Far as you go where?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can
talk to you about what’s in here. But I can’t talk to you about anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I signed a confidentiality agreement. I
honor agreements…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Doesn’t CBS have confidentiality agreements,
Mr. Bergman?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Between journalists and management, yes, I
believe they do…but I don’t take that seriously. Where do you work?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Did work.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Did work.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: How much would I get paid?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That, you have to discuss with CBS Business
Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10,
12 thousand.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Should I just take the documents now?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: If you want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I worked as the head of Research and
Development for Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company. I was a
Corporate Vice President. Mr. Bergman…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “President Assad of Syria said that
difficult obstacles remain but that his country, quote, ‘looks forward
to a great, long peace with Israel.’”</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: It’s a Peabody, Mike. When you’re dead
and buried, Hezbollah is the one they’re gonna remember you for…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …come in earlier on Mike’s Marine barracks
line when he’s talking to Sheikh Mussawi…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You eating with us?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Bring a tie so they’ll let us in the
front door…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Debbie…</p>
<p><strong>felling</strong>: Hey, Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, Bill… Main Justice is investigating a
major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City
branch. You want it for the Evening News?</p>
<p><strong>felling</strong>: What about you, you got a crew already?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m gonna do a follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>felling</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Catch ya’ later.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Debbie…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky
state law about. I want you to drop everything.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed security</strong>: Mr. Wigand, you can go up
now…</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: Sorry. I’m accepting an award from
the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation. It’s going to kill the rest of my
day.</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: Jeff’s a premiere golfer… What are
you, a two handicap?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Seven…</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: And, he gets out there and he has
five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I’ve ever
met. It’s spooky how he can concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’d rather play than talk about it. What did
you want to see me about? I don’t like being back here.</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: Jeffrey says exactly what’s on his
mind. Most people consider what they’re saying…social skills… Jeffrey
just charges right ahead. Now, I know you understood the nature of the
confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown &amp;
Williamson, Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Chapter and verse.</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: Yeah, I know you do… You know, I
came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I
never made a promise I couldn’t keep. I knew that if I ever broke my
promise I’d suffer the consequence…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Is that a threat?</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: …we worked together for, what was
it, three years…? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for
public scrutiny…any more than are one’s family matters…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You threatening my family, now, too?</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: Now, don’t be paranoid, Jeff. About
the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of
opinion…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: “Research…” You declare, as a badge of
honor, you don’t even know what makes water boil…</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: That’s why we hire scientists…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Okay. I don’t believe you can maintain
corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well
for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance
package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality
agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: I appreciate all that, Jeff. But,
upon reflection…we’ve decided to expand our zone of comfort with
you.</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: So we’ve drafted a supplement to
your agreement…it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is
“confidential.” Nobody will be able to say, “Well, hell’s bells,
Margaret, I didn’t know that was a secret…” We’re very serious about
protecting our interests. We’d like you to sign it.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: And if I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>a lawyer</strong>: If we “arrive” at the conclusion you’re
acting in bad faith? We would terminate, right now, payouts under your
severance package. You and your family’s medical benefits. And initiate
litigation against you, Mr. Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Dr. Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>a lawyer</strong>: Dr. Wigand…after you’ve examined the
document, you will see it is in your own best interest and you’ll sign
it.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: So, what you are saying is: it isn’t enough
that you fired me. For no good reason! Now you question my integrity? On
top of the humiliation of being fired? You threaten me?! You threaten my
family?! It never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement… But I will
tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and Brown &amp; Williamson, too… Fuck me? Well,
fuck you!!</p>
<p><strong>a lawyer</strong>: I’m not sure he got the message…</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: Oh, I think he did.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>wigand’s voice</strong>: …you fucked me!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …protect your sources…! You screwed me! You
sold me out!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What are you talking about? Where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Fuck you, too!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Stay away from me! You stay away from
me!</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches –</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Jump in, quick, c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: C’mere. I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Good. I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What do…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I did not burn you. I did not give you up to
anyone!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: This is my house… In front of my wife, my
kids?! What business do we have?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: To straighten something out with you. Right
here. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: So, you didn’t mention my name? You haven’t
talked to anybody about me?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Why am I gonna mention your name?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: How did Brown &amp; Williamson know I spoke
to you…?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: How the hell do I know about Brown &amp;
Williamson?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: It happened after I talked to you. I do not
like coincidences!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: And I don’t like paranoid accusations! I’m a
journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by
screwing the people who could provide me with information before they
provided me with it?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You came all the way down here to tell me
that?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story.
And you got something important to say. I can tell. But, yes. I did. I
came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your
story, I don’t burn people.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Ride with me while I take the girls to
school…</p>
<p><strong>wigand’s voice</strong>: …and my little girl has acute
asthma… Deborah. My eldest daughter.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: And, I’m unemployed. So I have to protect my
medical coverage. …so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded
confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: They’re afraid of you, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: They should be.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Talk to me outside the zone of your
agreement?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Like where’d you work before Brown &amp;
Williamson?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Johnson &amp; Johnson. Union Carbide in
Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak
Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All
health- related. What else? Outside the “zone”…?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I don’t know…you think the Knicks are gonna
make it through the semi-finals?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Just give me an example…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson
&amp; Johnson…when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in
Tylenol bottles, he didn’t argue with the FDA… He didn’t even wait for
the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every
store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety
cap… Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he’s gotta be a great businessman,
right? But he’s also a man of science. He’s not going to allow his
company…to put on the shelf…a product that might hurt people. Not like
the Seven Dwarfs…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Seven dwarfs?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco…they got up in
front of Congress that time…it was on television…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …and swore under oath that they know nothing
about addiction, disease…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Okay, so, here you are…you go to work for
tobacco. You come from corporate cultures where research, really,
creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco… Tobacco is
a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf
tournaments. The hell with everything else. What are you doing? Why are
you working for “tobacco” in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I can’t talk about it. The work I was
supposed to do…might have had some positive effect. I don’t know…it
could have been beneficial. Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money.
My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great
house. I mean, what the hell is wrong with that…?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Nothing’s wrong with that. That’s it; you’re
making money…you’re providing for your family? What could be wrong with
that?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’ve always thought of myself…as a man of
science. That’s what’s wrong with it.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Then…you’re in a state of conflict,
Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Because, look, here’s how it lays out: if
you got vital, insider stuff the American people for their welfare
really do need to know…and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate
your agreement in doing so, that’s one thing. On the other hand, if you
want to honor this agreement, then that’s simple. You do so. You say
nothing. You do nothing. There’s only one guy who can figure that out
for you. And that’s you. All by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’ve got to go pick up the girls. They only
had half a day…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: He referred to this…the Seven Dwarfs…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: What “Seven Dwarfs?”</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco… Referred to
this… Said they should be afraid of him… I assume, afraid of what he
could reveal. Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that
threatens these people?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Well, it isn’t “cigarettes are bad for
you”…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Hardly new news.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>mark stern</strong>: What that is is tobacco’s standard
defense. It’s the “we don’t know” litany: “Addiction? We believe not.
Disease? We don’t know. We take a bunch of leaves, roll ’em together.
You smoke ’em. After that? You’re on your own. We don’t know.” So…tells
me nothing. Besides, you’ll never get what he’s got.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>john harris</strong>: Because of this guy’s confidentiality
agreement, he is never gonna be able to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s not good enough. This guy is the top
scientist in the number three tobacco company in America. He’s a
corporate officer. You never get whistle-blowers from Fortune 500
companies. This guy is the ultimate insider. He’s got something to say;
he wants to say it; I want it on “60 Minutes.”</p>
<p><strong>john harris</strong>: Doesn’t matter what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Am I missing something here?</p>
<p><strong>john harris</strong>: What do you mean, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: He’s got a corporate secrecy
agreement? Give me a break. This is a public-health issue, like an
unsafe airframe on a passenger jet or…some company dumping cyanide into
the East River. Issues like that? He can talk, we can air it. They’ve
got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement. Pass the milk…</p>
<p><strong>john harris</strong>: They don’t need the right. They’ve got
the money.</p>
<p><strong>mark stern</strong>: The unlimited checkbook. That’s how Big
Tobacco wins every time. On everything. They spend you to death. $600
million a year in outside legal. Chadbourne-Parke. Ken Starr’s firm,
Kirkland and Ellis. Listen. GM and Ford, they get nailed after 11 or 12
pick-ups blow up. Right? These clowns have never…I mean ever…</p>
<p><strong>john harris</strong>: Not even once…</p>
<p><strong>mark stern</strong>: …not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness related to their product…have ever lost
a personal-injury lawsuit. On this case, they’ll issue gag orders, sue
for breach, anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us, his pet dog, the
dog’s veterinarian… Tie him up in litigation for ten of fifteen years.
I’m telling you, they bat a thousand. Every time. He knows that. That’s
why he’s not gonna talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Okay, let’s look through the looking glass
the other way…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: We got a guy…who wants to talk but he’s
constrained. What if he were “compelled”?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Oh, torture? Great ratings.</p>
<p><strong>mark stern</strong>: What do you mean compelled?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I mean compelled by a Justice Department,
state courts, be a witness. That would cut through any confidentiality
agreement, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mark stern</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: What does that do?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What do you mean, what’s it do?</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: What I mean is, like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Because he has to reveal it in a court of
law. It’s on record, it’s out. It’s no secret anymore. So how can they
restrain his speech or retaliate? It’s out in the world…</p>
<p><strong>mark stern</strong>: If you could engineer it into the court
record, you might have something. They would have a helluva time trying
to restrain his speech then, wouldn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>john harris</strong>: Yeah, but what venue? And where does he
get - does he have killer attorneys?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I don’t think he’s got any attorneys.</p>
<p><strong>mark stern</strong>: He’s gonna need attorneys who aren’t
afraid of risking years of litigation. And millions of dollars of their
own dough in legal costs…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What do you say, Mike? What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Even if he gets the defense team, will
he go for it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watson</strong>: …you’re awfully overqualified,
Dr. Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’m trying to…start a new career… I believe
I could be a good teacher…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watson</strong>: Let me give it some thought…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …and not a lot of companies in the
health-care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: That’s it…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: That’s where our babies were born… Debbie
took her first steps, right there…in the grass.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I didn’t plan on this…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Hey, hey, hey, c’mon. C’mon. We can make
this work for us. Okay? It’s just…it’s a smaller scale.
Simpler…easier…more time. More time together. More time with the kids.
More time for us, okay? It’s just… Can you imagine me coming home from
some job feeling good at the end of the day? This is gonna be better.
This is gonna be better.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Hey, baby. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What’s that outside, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Did you see somebody or did you hear
them?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I heard them.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: In the backyard.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Sit at Daddy’s desk, okay? Why don’t you
just sit up at the desk. Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay?
What are you gonna draw me, baby? An animal, something like that? You
stay down here until Daddy gets back…alright, Barbara? You stay down
here.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You almost got your damn head blown off…</p>
<p><strong>barbara’s voice</strong>: Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: It’s just a raccoon, baby…nothing.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: They’re nocturnal. You know what that means?
That means that they only come out at nighttime.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Lowell… Jeffrey Wigand…</p>
<p><strong>wigand’s voice</strong>: Is it too late?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No. No, it’s okay… How’s - how’s the new
place?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: The new place? New.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>wigand’s voice</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You know, I was thinking of calling you
tomorrow, anyway. How are your kids handling the new house?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Good. You have kids?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: We have a couple. One’s hers, one’s
mine. Everybody uses a different name. Modern marriage. How’s Liane?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: She’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Hold on a minute, Lowell… …somebody…may be
following me. I don’t know. They came on the property…</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: What do you mean followed you? Did
you call the police?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I don’t want to be paranoid… I mean, maybe
it’s a game. Some kind of mind game.</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Well, what do you really think,
though?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I don’t know what the fuck I really think!
Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me
feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don’t give a shit what I
think? I don’t know! I don’t fucking know.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Well, no, look…I mean, there was a
footprint. Forget it. It’s probably not important at all. You know, I
got a job now. I’m teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. So,
what were you calling about?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: You called me.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: No, you said you were going to call me
tomorrow. So, what about?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did…I wanted to talk to
you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking
about in your car.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …okay.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Makes you feel good? Putting what you know
to use?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: How’d you know that, Lowell?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: It’s obvious, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Hello. You there</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yeah… Look, thanks for talking. I’m sorry I
woke you up.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Lowell…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Who is this? Do not call here! Do not…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What did you get us?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Tempura…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a
major influence on the New Left in the late ’60s…and on me,
personally.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Next to your father?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: My father? What the hell’s that got to do
with my father?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Is that why you became a journalist? Then
you get to ask all the questions?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You charge by the hour?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: My father was a mechanical engineer…most
ingenious man I ever knew.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, my father left us when I was five-
years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew… Let’s get back
to Brown &amp; Williamson. If you decide to go on “60 Minutes,” I got to
know everything about why you got fired.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: They’re gonna dig up stuff from your past,
they’re gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they’re gonna throw.
You understand?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I drink. A couple of occasions more than I
should have. I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake… I
pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the
pressure. She went to her mother’s. I got fired because when I get angry
I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don’t like to be pushed
around!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m not pushing you around! I’m asking you
questions.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’m just a commodity to you, aren’t I? I
could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between
commercials…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …to a network, probably, we’re all
commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is
important.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You should. Because when you’re done, a
judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend.
And that’s the power you have.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I believe that? Yes, I believe that.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You believe that because you get information
out to people…something happens?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Maybe that’s just what you’ve been telling
yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status?
And maybe for the audience, it’s just voyeurism? Something to do on a
Sunday night. And maybe it won’t change a fucking thing. And people like
myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke,
alone!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Are you talking to me or did somebody else
just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I don’t think you really understand –</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, don’t evade a choice you gotta make be
questioning my reputation or “60 Minutes’” with this cheap
skepticism!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I have to put my family’s welfare on the
line here, my friend! And what are you puttin’ up? You’re puttin’ up
words!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Words! While you’ve been dickin’ around at
fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my
word and backing it up with action.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I said I’d call the kids before they went to
bed. Onisa…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: The stringer was supposed to be shooting
B-roll on street cops in New Orleans. What’s with all the horses?</p>
<p><strong>tony baldo</strong>: Camera guy’s got a thing about mounted
police.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Don’t any of these guys ride in cars or
walk?</p>
<p><strong>tony baldo</strong>: How long did he stay on this?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What was he seeing?</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Yes, hello… I’m trying to reach
Mr. Richard Scruggs…</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: This is Richard Scruggs…</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Could you hold on one second, please?
Lowell, I got him on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Hello, I’m Lowell Bergman.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Hold on… Mobile approach…this is
Lear November 643. Over.</p>
<p><strong>control operator’s voice</strong>: Go ahead 643.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Request a flight level 220, on a
heading of 284 degrees. Over. Mr. Bergman?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yes, I’m right here. Could you call me back
on a hard line?</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Area code 212-555-0199.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: I’ll call you then.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What do we do with that?</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs’ voice</strong>: Richard Scruggs…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on
behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, I’m working with someone, now, who was
the former head of research at Brown &amp; Williamson, a former
corporate officer there.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: What’s your interest in this,
Mr. Bergman?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, he may tape an interview with us. And,
we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would
free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some
protection.</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: It could work. If it’s public record, it’s
public record.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah, and he’s going to need legal
representation.</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: He sure as hell will.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Has he decided to go public?
Because let me tell you, we’ve been doing this for three years now, and
we’ve worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so
we know… Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So,
is your man truly committed?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, actually, no. Well, he’s on the fence.
That’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Well, we’d certainly be interested
in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he’s going to
do…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, would you want him to call you? Or,
you want to call him? How do you want to do it?</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: It would be better if he called
us.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Alright?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, we need cops on the street. We don’t
need them on horses.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: I don’t know what he was
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, for God’s sake, what has this guy got, a
horse fetish?</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Alright, alright.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I’ll
shoot the fucking thing myself!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What are you cooking?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I’m cooking pasta primavera.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, I love that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I’m going to have to go downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Debbie, Barbara… Debbie!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Dispatch received a call of shots fired in the
area. Uniforms arrived on the scene and found this white male subject
shot to death.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Was it gang related?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: There’s no indication as far as a tag or an
advertisement…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Excuse me. Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: They’re terrorizing us. Death threats?! To
my family? My kids?!</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jeff, call the FBI right away…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: They do this with impunity!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: They get to go home at night. What does it
cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so
fuck them! I want to tape! I’m done thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: I heard you. But I got to arrange a
legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on
public record.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Then hold it off the air until you got that.
But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right
now!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Good. But Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’ll call them, Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: Did you handle the round,
Mr. Wigand?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yes, I’m afraid I did.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #1</strong>: We won’t be able to lift usable
prints.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: A gun? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: What caliber is your gun?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What caliber is my gun?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: Yes, sir. What caliber is your
gun?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What does that have to do with the price of
tea in China?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You think I put that bullet in the mailbox
myself…?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: If we could take a look,
Mr. Wigand…</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #1</strong>: Why do you keep this gun?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I don’t think it’s unconstitutional yet to
own a gun. I’m a target shooter.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do
you own a .38?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun
safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: Do you have a history of emotional
problems, Mr. Wigand?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yes. Yes, I do. Yes, I get extremely
emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox…!</p>
<p><strong>liane’s voice</strong>: I didn’t tell you that so you could
just pick it up and take it away. Jeffrey!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I told him that you had an E-mail death
threat that said if you didn’t shut the “F” up, they were going to kill
you…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You can’t take that… It’s personal
property…!</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand.
There’s been a death threat.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …my files! Personal correspondence…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …letters to my brother…my will.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: You alright, Mr. Wigand?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #1</strong>: We need to take a look at your gun
safe, Mr. Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m telling you, your agents in that office
are acting improperly! Now, who are they trying to protect?</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson’s voice</strong>: Let me tell you something,
Lowell. Look, look, look. You’re talking about two agents in a regional
office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up
LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A. Alright?
When I get a chance, I’ll give it a look…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You better take a good look! Because I’m
getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been
offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of
those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance,
their ex-supervisor, who’s already at Brown &amp; Williamson as we
fucking speak?</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson</strong>: I’ll give it a look.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You’re getting my drift?</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson</strong>: I’ll give it a look.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: So, is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: How are the rooms? Comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Yes, very. You know, I enjoy your work so
much…when you’re talking to somebody, I always feel like I’m right
there.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Thank you got saying that…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Do you think we could talk about the taping?
Tomorrow’s taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Yeah, well, questions will go toward
what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: …taping? What are you taping?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’m doing an interview.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: An interview! Do you know what they will do
to us…! I thought… Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Liane, this is a preliminary… You didn’t
tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York
for?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …to talk about it. To think about it. I had
a plan to ease her into it. But, I really - I didn’t know how to do
that…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Who are these people?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Ordinary people! Under extraordinary
pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You heard Mr. Sandefur say before
Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself
because I watched those testimonies very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: All of us did. There was this whole
line of people…whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Part of the reason I’m here is I felt that
their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown &amp;
Williamson’s representation, clearly misstated…what is common language
within the company…we are in the nicotine delivery business.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: And that’s what cigarettes are
for…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: A delivery device for nicotine.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: A delivery device for nicotine. Put it
in your mouth, light it up, and you’re gonna get your fix…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You’re gonna get your fix…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You’re saying that Brown &amp;
Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially
adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use
of chemical elements such as ammonia…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: The process is known as “impact boosting…”
While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There’s
extensive use of this technology, know as “ammonia chemistry.” It allows
for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore
affect the brain and central nervous system.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: The straw that broke the camel’s back for me
and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called
“coumarin.” When I came on board at B&amp;W, they had tried to
transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same
taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was
told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I
constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience
continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had
documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: And you sent the document forward to
Sandefur?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I
was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren’t
going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his
decision.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: In other words, you were charging
Sandefur and Brown &amp; Williamson with ignoring health considerations
consciously…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Most certainly.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO
of Brown &amp; Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Poor communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: And, do you wish you hadn’t come
forward? You wish you hadn’t blown the whistle?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn’t done
it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I
do it again? Do I think it’s worth it? Yeah, I think it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: My name is Jeff Wigand. You can call me
Mr. Wigand; you can call me Dr. Wigand–I have a Ph.D. in biochemistry
and endocrinology; you can call me Jeff… Anything else you want to call
me…you’ll have to do so in private… Okay… I find chemistry to be
magical. I find it an adventure. An exploration into the building blocks
of our physical universe… So, how many of you have taken chemistry
before?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Okay…I’ve never taught it before, so we’re
gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: He’s on line three.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman
said I should give you a call…</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I
have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State
of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating
people with smoking-related illness. If you’d be interested in talking
to us, we’d certainly like to talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: When should we do this?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Who the hell are you?! What are you doing in
my house?!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: It’s okay, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Mr. Wigand, you need to speak
to…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: It’s okay. You got your own security
now…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Lowell, I can’t afford –</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …they “volunteered.” A friend owns a large
security company.</p>
<p><strong>talifaro</strong>: How are you doing, Mr. Wigand? I’m Jon
Talifaro. There’ll be three of us on detail.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I’m going to the store. Please explain our
new “houseguests” to your children.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’m going to be a witness for them in their
litigation. So I’m going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I know. I’m going to go there tonight…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Did you have a good day?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yes, I did. I had a great day.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Coffee, Lowell?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah. Want to play that game we were playing
before? You know, I think you got it up to five. I was ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Please don’t wash your hands in the sink.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Where should I wash them?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Use the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What’s the difference…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: That’s for food.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: I don’t think I can do this… I want to stand
by my husband… I really do, Jeffrey. But I don’t think I can do this
anymore. I am so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Can we talk about this when I get back?</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Yes…Jeffrey.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Jeff…?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: You’ve been served.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Now, what this one is, is a
temporary restraining order, a gag order, issued by a Kentucky
court.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.</p>
<p><strong>michael moore</strong>: Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Mike’s our Attorney General down
here. I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue
a gag order to stop his deposition today.</p>
<p><strong>michael moore</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Now, they tried to get the
Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out… However, for
you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order…</p>
<p><strong>michael moore</strong>: Dr. Wigand, you do understand what
could happen, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’m not free to testify…here…?</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: That’s right. If you violate the Kentucky
order, when you step foot back in Kentucky, they can find you in
contempt and they can incarcerate you. And you ought to know that.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Jail?</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Possibly, yes. That is one of the
possible consequences of your testifying here today. That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: How does one…“go…to…jail?” What does my
family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who’s going to look
after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I’m not
teaching…there’s no medical…no medical…even on co-pay, that’s like…
Tuition…</p>
<p><strong>michael moore</strong>: Dr. Wigand, listen, you may not be
able to do this thing. As I understand from Dick, you’re our key
witness. And, I hope you don’t withdraw. I guess we’d all understand if
you did… Guys, I’ve got to go. I’m gonna be late for court. I’ll see
y’all a little later. Dr. Wigand, good luck.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: I know what you’re facing, Jeff.
And, I think I know how you’re feeling…</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: In the Navy I flew A-6’s off
carriers… In combat, events have a duration of seconds, sometimes
minutes… But what you’re going through goes on day in and day out.
Whether you’re ready for it or not, week in, week out… Month after month
after month. Whether you’re up or whether you’re down. You’re assaulted
psychologically. You’re assaulted financially, which is its own special
kind of violence. Because it’s directed at your kids…what school can you
afford… How will that affect their lives. You’re asking yourself: Will
that limit what they may become? You feel your whole family’s future’s
compromised…held hostage… I do know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You attract a crowd.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yeah, great.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I heard about the Kentucky gag order…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>tobacco lawyer</strong>: Hold on a second… Would you please
ask Mr. Motley if he expects his witness to appear or not…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I can’t seem to find…the criteria to decide.
It’s too big a decision to make without being resolved…in my own
mind.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Maybe things have changed…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What’s changed?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You mean…since this morning?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: No. I mean since whenever…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Fuck it. Let’s go to court.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: Dr. Wigand would like to leave
now.</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: Okay, Jeff, I’m going to sit you down at
that table over there. I’m going to start as fast as possible. I don’t
want to give them a chance to get another restraining order, okay? Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>michael moore</strong>: Good luck, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>stenographer</strong>: Please stand. Raise your right hand…
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>stenographer</strong>: You may be seated.</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under
oath. This is a sworn deposition. There’s no judge. It’s not a trial.
Will you state your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Jeffrey S. Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Got any idea what’s going on in
there?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, I don’t have a clue.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: In other words, it acts as a drug?</p>
<p><strong>tobacco lawyer</strong>: Object to the form of the
question!</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: It acts as a drug on the body?</p>
<p><strong>tobacco lawyer</strong>: Object to the form!</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: It acts as a…</p>
<p><strong>tobacco lawyer</strong>: Object!</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: There an echo in here? Your objection’s been
recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It’s on the
record. So now I’ll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it
act as a drug?</p>
<p><strong>tobacco lawyer</strong>: Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you…
…not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the
contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any
information about your work at the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary
restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in
the State of Kentucky! That means you don’t talk! Mr. Motley, we have
rights, here…</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs
and middles! So what?! You don’t get to instruct anything around here!
This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the
sovereign State of Mississippi’s proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your
face! Dr. Wigand’s deposition will be part of this record. And I’m going
to take my witness’ testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!
Answer the question, Dr…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yes. It produces a physiological response,
which meets the definition of a drug! Nicotine is associated with
impact, with satisfaction. It has a pharmacological effect that crosses
the blood-brain barrier intact…</p>
<p><strong>motley</strong>: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: “Part of the reason I’m here is I felt that
their representation clearly, at least within…”</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Run that Sandefur piece on “nicotine’s not
addictive.” Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with “I believe
they perjured…” Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on
Jeff and play the pause after the word “felt” on the B-side…</p>
<p><strong>bill felling</strong>: …helluva show, Mike. Explosive
material.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: It went great in Mississippi, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: I heard Wigand’s deposition got
sealed.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the
secret formula of “Kools” to the world. “Sealed” doesn’t hurt Scruggs’
litigation, and since we’re the only ones with the story, I believe
we’re sitting on an exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: I like that…</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Corporate has some questions. We’ve got
a meeting at Black Rock first thing in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: When’s the air date?</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon’s on line
3.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Tell her I’ll call her back in ten.</p>
<p><strong>baldo</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I’m
late.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: No, no, we’re fine…</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: Alright, I thought we’d get
together because there’s a legal concept that has been getting some new
attention recently, “tortious interference.” If two people have an
agreement, like a confidentiality agreement, and one of them breaks it
because they are induced to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party can be
sued for damages for interfering…hence, “tortious interference.”</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Interfering? That’s what we do.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I think what we’re trying to tell you is
that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are
always telling us things they shouldn’t. We have to verify if it’s true
and in the public interest… And if it is, we air it.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: After we corroborate it. That’s why
we’ve never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: And “60 Minutes’” verification is
exact. And precise. And I don’t think it would hurt to make sure you’re
right…on this one.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Why? You think we have liability? What’s
the CBS News’ position, Eric?</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: There’s a possibility, it’s rather
remote…</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: But one we have to check on, Mike.
I’ve retained outside counsel to do exactly that. On a segment, I might
add, that’s already rife with problems…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What does that mean? “Rife with – ?”</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: I’m told unusual promises were made
to Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, only that we would hold the story until
it was safe for him…</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: And, I’m told there are questions
as to our “star witness’” veracity.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: His “veracity” was good enough for the State
of Mississippi.</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: Our standards have to be higher
than anyone else’s, because we are the standard…for everyone else…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, as a “standard”…I’ll hang with “is the
guy telling the truth?”</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: Well, with tortious interference,
I’m afraid…the greater the truth, the greater the damage.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: They own the information he’s
disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied,
he didn’t disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Is this “Alice in Wonderland”?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You said “on this one.” What about
“this one”?</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: If this holds up, and it very well
may not, Mike…but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was
sued by Brown &amp; Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: How grace?</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: Well, at the end of the day…because
of your segment…the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company…could own
CBS.</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: You know, I am sorry. But I’m due
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go
to air with this story?</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: You’re getting ahead of yourself.
We’re all in this together. We’re all CBS. We’ll find out soon. Thank
you, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: “Tortious interference”? Sounds like a
disease caught by a radio.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Lunch?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Sure. Don’t worry, we call the shots
around here.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Debbie, it’s me. I want you to check some
filings and give me John Wilson’s number at Bear-Stern.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Kluster’s coming over.</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: Hello, Lowell, Mike, Don.</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: There has been so much soul searching
about this Wigand, I’ve decided we should cut an alternate version of
the show without his interview.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli’s
checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: That’s happening. And, hopefully we
won’t have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m not touching my film…</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: I’m afraid you are.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: We’re doing this with or without you,
Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your
show…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Since when has the paragon of investigative
journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on “60
Minutes”?</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: It’s an alternate version. So what if we
have an alternate version? And I don’t think her being cautious is so
damned unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: So, now, if you’ll excuse me,
gentlemen, Mr. Rather’s been complaining about his chair again.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Before you go…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I discovered this. SEC filing… For the sale
of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Yeah, I heard rumors.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: It’s not a rumor. It’s a sale. If Tisch can
unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly
threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown &amp;
Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: And what are you implying?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m not implying. I’m quoting. More vested
interests… “Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger… Ms. Helen
Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster,
President of CBS News, 1.4 million…”</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Are you suggesting that she and Eric are
influenced by money?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, no, of course they’re not influenced by
money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive
Producer.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: CBS does not do that. And, you’re
questioning our journalistic integrity?!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, I’m questioning your hearing! You hear
“reasonable” and “tortious interference.” I hear… “Potential Brown &amp;
Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse.” I
hear… “Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck
off…!” That’s what I hear.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: You’re exaggerating!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand,
to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television.
I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement. And he’s only the key witness in the biggest
public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive
corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who’s
out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it
newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he’s
not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That’s why
we’re not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it
gets!</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You
know that? If we can’t have a whole show, then I want half a show rather
than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won’t be satisfied unless you’re
putting the company at risk!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: C’mon, what are you? And are you a
businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike
and I do for a living…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: “Put the corporation at risk”…? Give me a
fucking break!</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: These people are putting our whole reason
for doing what we do…on the line!</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Lowell!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: I’m with Don on this.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: They’re killing the Wigand interview…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: They’re pretending it’s process. Bullshit,
it’s foregone.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What are you and Mike going to do?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m alone on this…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, baby…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Jeffrey Wigand…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jeffrey…</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Jeffrey, how are you? How’s the
family, okay?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: There is - there is no family.</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: What do you mean there is no
family?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Liane has filed for divorce…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: And, so, I moved out… I see the girls a
couple of days a week…</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Where you staying now?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Our favorite hotel, honey… I checked into
Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I don’t know how to say this, Jeff, except
to just say it right out, so I’ll say it. They do not want to air
it.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: B &amp; W may have threatened litigation…
CBS is on the block… But you, I mean, I know how…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No? No, what?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I do not think that you “know” for me…what
it is to walk in my shoes… …for my kids to have seen it…for them to know
why I’ve put them through what I did…the public airing of that…the
testament to why I did what I did…you’re telling me is not going to see
the light of day.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jeff…</p>
<p><strong>p.i.</strong>: Mrs. Wigand?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: It hasn’t been Mrs. Wigand for some
time.</p>
<p><strong>p.i.</strong>: Well, I’m an investigator and I was - I was
wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions about that?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Alright…</p>
<p><strong>susan wigand</strong>: …seven months after we were married we
found out that I had multiple sclerosis…</p>
<p><strong>p.i.’s voice</strong>: And, you had a daughter, Diane, with
him, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>susan wigand</strong>: Yes, in 1973.</p>
<p><strong>john scanlon</strong>: …come on, Tommy Sandefur told me
himself, he’s not gonna allow Brown &amp; Williamson to be demonized to
the American public, so I told Peter Jennings and I…hold on…</p>
<p><strong>p.i.’s voice</strong>: Would it be fair to say when he
divorced you he left you in a precarious situation? You had multiple
sclerosis; you had a small child to raise.</p>
<p><strong>john scanlon</strong>: Mention that part in the executive
summary and in the chapters “First Wife” and “Estrangement of Daughter.”
So, I was telling Pete, I said, “You’ve been taken in by this guy…</p>
<p><strong>susan wigand</strong>: Yes… But you have to understand, the
divorce was something that we both wanted…</p>
<p><strong>john scanlon</strong>: He’s a total bullshit artist. He’s a
shoplifter. He’s a convicted shoplifter.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: So, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, what do you think I’m going to do?
Quit in protest? I’m not going to do that.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: You’re taking “no” for an answer?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No. I’m not going to take “no” for an
answer. No.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Then what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m staying right here. Doing my job.
Fighting to get my show on the air. You don’t like it? Hey, I’ll tell
you what…fire my ass…</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don’t think so. Take a look at
this… This is a summary of a dossier that’s being prepared.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: He would lie about his whole life…?
Who’s going to believe him about anything he says…? The Wall Street
Journal’s doing a major story and I think the Post. You backed the wrong
horse…</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Get me Wigand.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …fuck is this? Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: You never told me you were married
before…that you had a daughter…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Well, how is that any of your business?!
That is not something that you people need to know!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, you know what we do or do not need to
know? Since when have you become a media expert?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my
ass, too…!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>wigand’s voice</strong>: You’re not even on this anymore…
What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the
line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything
with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I told the truth!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Everything…you…say! And I can’t defend you,
man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me…what
they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: …I was young. I was young…confused… We
didn’t handle it the right way…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: She sued you for back payments of child
support?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: She did not sue me. We had a dispute over
money… I settled it, she dropped the complaint… Any other questions?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yes. Did you lie about being on the American
Judo Team in the Olympics?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Some public relations guy got a hold of a
tape of an interview…where you’re saying you were on the American Judo
Team in the Olympics…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What kind of shit is this? I was not on the
team, I sparred with the Olympic Team…okay?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Alright…the ABC Telemarketing Company?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: ABC Telemarketing Company.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I
cancelled payment… It was junk. You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You
ever look at another woman’s tits? You ever cheat a little on your
taxes? Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn’t have
any flaws…?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s the whole point, Jeffrey. That’s the
whole point. Anyone’s. Everyone’s. They are gonna look under every rock,
dig up every flaw, every mistake you’ve ever made. They are going to
distort and exaggerate everything you’ve ever done, man. Don’t you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What does this have to do with my
testimony?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: What does this have to do with my
testimony?! I told the truth! It’s valid and true and provable!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s not the fucking point, whether you
told the truth or not! Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I told the truth… I told the truth.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: I’ve got to teach class. I’ve got to go.
I’ve got to teach class.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: And I’ve got to refute every fucking
accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs. I am
trying to protect you, man!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Well, I hope you improve your batting
average.</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: It’s Lowell. Are you guys planning
to do a piece on a former top executive in Big Tobacco?</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: You caught me in a news
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: You bet we are. And I can’t talk
to you now.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: We gotta hook up.</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: Sure. Where?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: P.J.’s.</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah, I got it. 500 pages of it. They looked
in every corner of this guy’s life…from a spousal abuse charge, to
shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got once for running a red light.
It’s Terry Lenzner’s outfit, IGI. Jack, listen to me. Their strategy:
discredit this guy, ruin his reputation in The Wall Street Journal, and
then nobody will ever listen to what he’s got to say about tobacco. He’s
dead. Unless I can get this thing knocked down.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: To make it even a little more attractive, I
don’t know if you’re ever gonna get paid.</p>
<p><strong>sandra sutherland</strong>: Is there any truth to any of
it?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s a good question. “Is there any truth
to any of it?” I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>palladino</strong>: What’s their deadline?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>palladino</strong>: Fax me the summary.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s great, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Hey, Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: How are you, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting
on something sensational over there.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Really? Hi, Joan.</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Hi, baby.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: When’s your deadline?</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: Monday.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Push it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: What? Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: It’s a smear campaign, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: It’s drawn from a selectively
circulated…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, it’s real selective…about as hard to get
a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: Well, it’s authoritative and is
overwhelmingly documented.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: And it’s bullshit. And if I’m right, are you
going to put the Journal’s reputation behind a story that’s going to
blow up in your face?</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: I’ll take a look at what you got.
But I’m not moving any deadlines ’cause you say so.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah. Catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>sandra sutherland</strong>: Officer Murabchick?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>sandra sutherland</strong>: Fine, thank you. I’m doing a
background check. Mind if I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>palladino</strong>: Your honor, could I have a word with you?
You presided in a dispute over support payments…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Jeffrey Wigand? Yeah, I cited him.</p>
<p><strong>dan rather</strong>: CBS is under criticism, because the CBS
News program “60 Minutes” will not be presenting an interview…</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What does it look like I’m doing? I’m
editing.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: No, not that. I’m talking about the
Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and
they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No. I should have. I told them I disagreed
with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original.
I’m not lying for you. I’m not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of
it.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Hey! I’m not going to fire you, okay?
Take a vacation. Now!</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace’s voice</strong>: Lowell. I decided to preface
Sunday’s show. I did three minutes on the “Evening News.” You’ll want to
see it. Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’ve been banished. In lieu of being
fired.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: I took off on Tisch. I took off on
corporate. They’ll know they’re not going to see everything on Sunday
night…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I don’t know. How does that get Wigand on
the air?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for
God’s sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I’m going to
resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is “no.” I don’t
plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National
Public Radio. That decision I’ve already made.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It just started, Mike…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace’s voice</strong>: Where’s the rest? Where the
hell’s the rest?!!</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You cut it! You cut the guts out of
what I said…!</p>
<p><strong>eric kluster</strong>: It was a time consideration, Mike…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Time? Bullshit! You corporate lackey!
Who told you your incompetent little fingers had the requisite skills to
edit me! I’m trying to Band-Aid a situation, here, and you’re too dim
to…</p>
<p><strong>helen caperelli</strong>: Mike… Mike… Mike…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “Mike?”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “Mike?” Try “Mr. Wallace.” We work in
the same corporation doesn’t mean we work in the same profession. What
are you gonna do now? You gonna finesse me? Lawyer me some more? I’ve
been in this profession fifty fucking years. You and the people you work
for are destroying the most-respected, the highest-rated, the
most-profitable show on this network!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: These are their leads, their sources. I want
you to have your reporters…</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Have them make their own calls. They’ll find
that these sources have a different story than the one that’s in the
dossier… Push the deadline, Charlie…</p>
<p><strong>charlie phillips</strong>: I’ll push it for a week. Let Milo
and Suein go through it.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: What do you want to buy him for a gift?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He’s into kind of little cars, that…</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: That remote control thing?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Alright, we’ll do that tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>liane</strong>: Yes, baby?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: There’s Dad, on TV.</p>
<p><strong>local newscaster</strong>: And in local news, WLKO Louisville
has gained access to a five-hundred-page dossier on former Brown &amp;
Williamson research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing charges of spousal
abuse, shoplifting…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “…thousands of documents from inside
the tobacco industry have surfaced over the past year, documents that
appear to confirm what a former…”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “…US Surgeon General and the current
head of the Food and Drug Administration have been saying. We learned
of…”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “…a tobacco insider who could tell us
whether or not the tobacco industry has been leveling with the
public…”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “…that insider was formerly a highly-
placed executive with a tobacco company…”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “…but we cannot broadcast what
critical information about tobacco, addiction and public health he might
be able to offer. Why? Because he had to sign a confidentiality
agreement with the tobacco company he worked for…”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “The management of CBS has told us
that knowing he had that agreement…”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “…if were to broadcast an interview
with him, CBS could be faced with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit…”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “The fact is, we are not allowed even
to mention his name or the name of the company he worked for and, of
course, we cannot show you his face… ‘…and your confidentiality
agreement with… is still in force?’”</p>
<p><strong>wigand’s voice</strong>: “Yes, it is.”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “So, what are they gonna do? Sue you
for making this appearance?”</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: “I would bet on it.”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “The former executive has reason to
bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers…”</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You disappeared on me. How long you
staying?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I disappeared on you?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Alright. What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I think it was a disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>an operator’s voice</strong>: Sir, there’s still no answer in
that room.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Alright. Get me the manager’s office…</p>
<p><strong>hotel desk clerk</strong>: David? David, you’ve got a call on
line 4. I think you better take it.</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager</strong>: This is David MacDougal. How can
I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Mr. MacDougal, my name is Lowell
Bergman. I’m a producer for “60 Minutes”… I’m concerned with a friend of
mine who’s staying at your hotel right now.</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager</strong>: Mr. Wigand? Mr. Wigand?</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager’s voice</strong>: I think I need to call
the police. He won’t respond…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, no. Don’t call the police! Just tell him
I’m on the phone with you… My name is Lowell Bergman… Just tell him
that.</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager</strong>: Mr. Wigand…Mr. Bergman is on the
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Did he hear you?</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager’s voice</strong>: You’re breaking up. I
can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What about now?</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Hello, can you hear me now?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: What’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager’s voice</strong>: He doesn’t seem to be
listening…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Alright, now listen to me. I want you - I
want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone…!</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager’s voice</strong>: I can’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, you can. Tell him to get on the fucking
phone!</p>
<p><strong>the hotel manager</strong>: He told me to tell you, to get
on…the fucking phone…!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You manipulated me into this…!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: That’s bullshit, Jeff!</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You greased the rails!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to
say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You’re not a robot, Jeff!
That’s all. You got a mind of your own, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: “Up to you, Jeffrey. That’s the power you
have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to
know.” Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn’t
turn around.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I fought for you…and I still fight for
you.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You fought for me…?! …you manipulated
me…into where I am now…staring at the Brown &amp; Williamson Building.
It’s all dark. Except the 10th floor! That’s the legal department.
That’s where they fuck with my life!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where
you goin’? You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think
about that. You think about them.</p>
<p><strong>close on jeffrey</strong>: standing in the room with the
blowing curtains…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m running out of heroes, man… Guys like
you are in short supply.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Yeah, guys like you, too.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Where are you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m on a leave of absence. Forced
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: You try and have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I will.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: “I’m Lowell Bergman, I’m from ‘60 Minutes.’”
You know, you take the “60 Minutes” out of that sentence, nobody returns
your phone call. Maybe Wigand’s right. Maybe I’m hooked. What am I
hooked on? The rush? “60 Minutes”? What the hell for? Infotainment. It’s
so fucking useless, all of it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So, it’s a big country with a free press.
You can go work somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Free press? Press is free…for anyone who
owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Get some perspective, Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I got perspective.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No, you do not.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: From my perspective, what’s been going on
and what I’ve been doing is ridiculous. It’s half-measures.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You’re not listening. Really know what
you’re going to do before you do it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca’s voice</strong>: I’ve got Richard Scruggs on
the phone…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Patch him through.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs’ voice</strong>: Well, Lowell, you are not
going to believe this…</p>
<p><strong>ricahrd scruggs</strong>: The Governor of Mississippi is
suing his own Attorney General…to abandon litigation against Big
Tobacco…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, good…</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: But, now that the version without
Jeff ran…what’s the chance of getting his interview on the air…?
Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: What chance is there of getting
Jeff’s interview on the air…?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Less than great.</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: …I’d be lying to you if I did not
tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: …and I’d be lying to you if I didn’t tell
you, I’m about out of moves, Dick…</p>
<p><strong>richard scruggs</strong>: All right. See you…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Hi. So, what are you folks doing here in
Lincoln?</p>
<p><strong>man geologist</strong>: Geology survey.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Geology. Yeah? Really?</p>
<p><strong>woman geologist</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I work for CBS News.</p>
<p><strong>man geologist</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Just ran into two of your “geologists.”
Geologists whose hands aren’t all chewed up…?</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson’s voice</strong>: Lowell?</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson</strong>: Do not…screw this up. We are a week
away from an arrest…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: So, I’ll hold it… And…</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson’s voice</strong>: We’ll give you a heads up
before we launch.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson’s voice</strong>: Three hours.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You got a deal.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace’s voice</strong>: “…like the testimony before
Congress of Dr. Wigand’s former boss, Brown &amp; Williamson’s Chief
Executive Officer, Thomas Sandefur.”</p>
<p><strong>thomas sandefur</strong>: “I believe that nicotine is not
addictive.”</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: “I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself…
Because I watched those testimonies very carefully.”</p>
<p><strong>wallace’s voice</strong>: “All of us did…there was this whole
like of people, the whole line of CEOs up there, all swearing that.”</p>
<p><strong>wigand’s voice</strong>: “Part of the reason I’m here is
I</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: “…that their representation…”</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Jim, it’s Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Hey! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Remember that night at P.J.’s? You
asked me if we were sitting on something “explosive”? Well, we’re not
“sitting on” it. CBS corporate leaned on CBS News which yanked an
interview we did with a top- ranking tobacco scientist. A corporate
officer. They are trying to close down the story.</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: You mean, “60 Minutes” is letting CBS
corporate decide what is or is not news? What’s Wallace think about
this, or Hewitt, or…?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: How prominent? What kind of placement?</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Oh, c’mon, Lowell. This is The New York
Times. I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Well, until you do, all I can tell you is
what you already know…they will not air an interview.</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Call me back in ten.</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Debbie. It’s me…</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Hi. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Oh, it’s late.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: That I know. When are you coming
back?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I can’t get out of here til mid-morning.
I’ll be in tomorrow night… Listen, could you call a number for me, it’s
in Mississippi…</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: Okay. Hold on a second… What is
it?</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lowell’s voice</strong>: Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper</strong>: Alright, Lowell. Page one. Editorial’s
interested. Let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Here’s how it works. You ask me questions. I
tell you if you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper’s voice</strong>: Okay. Lowell?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper’s voice</strong>: You’re sure you want to do
this?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper’s voice</strong>: Hey, it doesn’t work? You’ve
burned your bridges, man.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: You ready…?</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper’s voice</strong>: Okay… About this whistle-blower…
Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Did I tell you you were wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jim cooper’s voice</strong>: No. I’m assuming the cave-in
begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we
talking…are we talking Brown &amp; Williamson, here?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Did I get you up?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, I usually sit around in my hotel room,
dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: How many shows have we done? Huh?
C’mon, how many?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, lots.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get
off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story
changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking
time! You want to know why?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: I see a rhetorical question on the
horizon.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I’m going to tell you why. Because when I
tell someone I’m going to do something, I deliver.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell
Bergman’s moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me
the way.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Oh, please, Mike…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Give me a break!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, you give me a break! I never left a
source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not ’til right fucking now!
When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I’m gonna leave
with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you’re supposed
to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie
down? Back off? What, get over it?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: In the real world, when you get to
where I am, there are other considerations…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Like what? Corporate responsibility? What,
are we talking celebrity here?</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: I’m not talking celebrity, vanity,
CBS. I’m talking about when you’re nearer the end of your life than the
beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? “In
the future I’m going to do this? Become that?” What “future”? No. What
you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Mike…in my…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You and I have been doing this
together for fourteen years.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: They conclude most of it seems pretty
unsubstantiated… You’re full of shit, John.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: …front page. There’s a picture of
Wigand. Article’s entitled, “Getting Personal,” by-lined to Suein Hwang
and Milo Geyelin. Wait, hold on a second, Lowell.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca</strong>: The sub-heading is, “Brown &amp;
Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic.” It quotes
Richard Scruggs calling it “the worst kind of an organized smear
campaign against a whistle-blower.”</p>
<p><strong>debbie deluca’s voice</strong>: “…a close look at the file,
and independent research by this newspaper into its key claims,
indicates that many of the serious allegations against Mr. Wigand are
backed by scant or contradictory evidence…”</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: The news division has been vilified in
The New York Times, in print, on television, for caving to corporate
interests!</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: The New York Times ran a blow by blow of
what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: No, you fucked you! Don’t invert stuff! Big
Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal,
here, not exactly a bastion of anti- capitalist sentiment, refutes Big
Tobacco’s smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination!
And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show
is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in
the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you’re still
standing here debating! Don, what the hell else…do you need?</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Mike, you tell him…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: You fucked up, Don.</p>
<p><strong>don hewitt</strong>: Hey, it’s old news! Stick with me. Like
always, we’ll be okay. These things have a half-life of fifteen
minutes…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: No, that’s fame. Fame has a fifteen-
minute half-life… Infamy…lasts a little longer.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: We caved. It’s foolish. It’s simply
dead wrong. Now, this is what we’re going to do. We’re going over to
Black Rock…</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: Okay, so let’s get back to it. Alright, now,
what we saw there was…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: They cancelled the six o’clock. I don’t know
why. I’m on the 8:10. I should be home…9:30. I’ll see you then. Love
ya’. Bye…</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “CBS Management wouldn’t let us
broadcast our original story and our interview with Wigand because they
were worried about the possibility of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit
against us for tortious interference… But now things have changed.”</p>
<p><strong>michael moore</strong>: “…in my opinion, is an industry that
has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the American public in
history.”</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: “You wish you hadn’t blown the
whistle?”</p>
<p><strong>wigand</strong>: “There are times…I wish I hadn’t done it.
But there are times that I feel compelled to do it…” “I’ve - if you
asked me if I would do it again or if it’s - do I think it’s worth it.
Yeah. I think it’s worth it.”</p>
<p><strong>bill robertson</strong>: I promised you a three-hour heads-
up…well, here it is. Have a camera crew standing by in Helena, Montana
on Tuesday and I’ll give you a three-hour head start. Alright? By the
way, that was a hell of a good show tonight…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Thank you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You won.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Yeah? What did I win?</p>
<p><strong>dan rather</strong>: “Reporting from CBS World News
headquarters in New York, good afternoon. There has been a major break
in the case of the so-called ‘Unabomber.’ CBS News has learned that a
remote homesite outside Lincoln, Montana has been under FBI
surveillance…”</p>
<p><strong>bill felling</strong>: Thanks for this. You know, we beat
everybody. ABC, NBC, CNN.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: That Canada story? Still interest
you?</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: Everything interests me.</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I quit, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>mike wallace</strong>: C’mon, it all worked out. You came out
okay in the end…</p>
<p><strong>lowell</strong>: I did? What do I tell a source on the next
tough story? Hang in with us. You’ll be fine…maybe?</p>
