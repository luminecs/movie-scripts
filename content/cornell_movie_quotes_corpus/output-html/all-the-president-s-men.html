<h1 id="all-the-president-s-men">all-the-president-s-men</h1>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: No, no trouble, Harry, be right down. Son
of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Where’s that cheery face we’ve come to
know and love?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You call me in on my day off because some
idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters–tell me, Harry,
why should I be smiling?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: As usual, that keen mind of yours has
pegged the situation perfectly. Except it wasn’t local Democratic
Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters– –and these
weren’t just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they
were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits
and Playtex gloves and were carrying– –a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of
film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging
devices. Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced
hundred dollar bills.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Preliminary hearing at Superior
Courthouse?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Two o’clock, work the phones ’til you
go.</p>
<p>****: Could you give me the names of the lawyers for the men arrested
in the Watergate.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: These two were appointed– –only now it turns
out the burglars got their own counsel.</p>
<p><strong>first angry lawyer</strong>: When you gonna stop thinking
it’s so funny.</p>
<p><strong>second angry lawyer</strong>: We wouldda done a terrific job
protecting those guys.</p>
<p><strong>first angry lawyer</strong>: You think we’re not as good as
some hotshot fancy lawyer?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Mr. Caddy? My name’s Bob Woodward, I’m
from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this
case–</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: –I’m not here.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record,
when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in
the courtroom, “I’m not here,” Mr. Caddy said.</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: Clearly, I am here, but only as an
individual, I’m not the attorney of record. Mr. Rafferty has that
position. Whatever you want, you’ll have to get from him, I have nothing
more to say.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four
Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: Look, I told you inside–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –you have nothing more to say, I
understand that.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What I don’t understand is how you got
here.</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: I assure you, there’s nothing mysterious
involved.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Probably you’re right, but a little while
ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who’d been assigned to
represent the burglars.</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Well, they never would have been assigned
if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And
that could only mean the burglars didn’t arrange for their own
counsel–they never even made a phone call. So if they didn’t ask for you
to be here, how did you know to come?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Did you know to come because one of the
other men involved in the break- in called you?</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: There is no reason to assume other people
were involved.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Your clients were arrested with a
walkie-talkie; they didn’t need that to talk among themselves.</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: They are not my clients.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You’re a lawyer and you’re here–</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: –I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at
a social occasion once– –I have nothing more to say.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: CADDY turns away</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: Barker’s wife called me at three this
morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn’t called
her by then.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It was really nice of you to come, since
you’d only met him once.</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: Are you implying you don’t believe me?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I have nothing more to say.</p>
<p><strong>caddy</strong>: You don’t mind getting on people’s nerves, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Will you please state your professions.</p>
<p><strong>barker</strong>: Anti-Communists.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Anti-Communists? That, sir, is not your
average occupation.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Your name, please.</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: James McCord.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Will you step forward, sir.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: Security consultant.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: Government. Recently retired.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Where in government?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: …Central… Intelligence… Agency…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>mccord</strong>: The C.I.A.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>union post employee</strong>: “Five men, one of whom said he
is a former employee…” Schmucks.</p>
<p><strong>first voice</strong>: Hurry it, huh, Bachinski?</p>
<p><strong>bachinski</strong>: You said I could look at it–</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: –I said look, not memorize–</p>
<p><strong>bachinski</strong>: –almost done, give it a rest, all
right…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What’d you find?</p>
<p><strong>bachinski</strong>: Beats me. These notebooks belonged to
Cuban guys?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: S’right.</p>
<p><strong>bachinski</strong>: It’s gotta mean either White House or
whore house, one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Bachinski? What?–hold it– –OK, go on, go
on…</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: …go on, go on…</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: That’s everything Bachinski had, I think
it’s worth following up.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Don’t know; who the hell’s Howard Hunt?
It’s probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy
Cubans.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Woodward’s onto a new wrinkle with the
break-in thing–absolute page one stuff–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –in other words, you got nothing, you’re
thumbsucking.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Could develop.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: Let me see what you get, but don’t jump–The
New York Times thinks it’s crazy Cubans.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: OK, get on this W.House guy and do a
better job then you did on McCord.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I did all right on McCord.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Then how come the Associated Press were
the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the
Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: The head of security for the reelection of
a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the
Democrats? What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP,
says it means nothing. “…This man and the other people involved were not
operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in
our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and
we will not forget it or condone it.”</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You can’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can
throw Bronco Nagurski, that’s how much I trust John Mitchell…</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: What’d you get on W.House?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Lotsa hints–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: I can’t sell hints to Simons– –you called
everyone you know? Call someone you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>now we see the book</strong>: It’s the Washington Phone
Directory and we’re in the W’s. As WOODWARD’s finger stops, we can see
he’s looking at the White HOuse entry number. There it is, just like
your name and mine. Listed.</p>
<p><strong>white house operator</strong>: White House.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Howard Hunt, please.</p>
<p><strong>white house operator</strong>: Mr. Hunt does not answer.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Thanks, anyway–</p>
<p><strong>white house operator</strong>: I’ll bet he’s in Mr. Colson’s
office. Let me connect you.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Charles Colson’s wire.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Howard Hunt, please.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Hunt isn’t here just now.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Thanks, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Have you tried Mullen and Company Public
Relations? He works at Mullen and Company Public Relations as a writer.
The number is 555-1313. I’m sorry I couldn’t be more helpful.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Listen, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Who’s Charles Colson?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: I would liken your query to being in
Russia half a century ago and asking someone, “I understand who Lenin is
and Trotsky I got too, but who’s this yokel Stalin?”</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Who’s Colson, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: The most powerful man in America is
President Nixon, probably you’ve heard his name.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: The second most powerful man is Robert
Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman’s friend,
and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are
referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall.
Mr. Mitchell we’ve already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President’s
special counsel.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Thanks, Harry. Know anything about
Colson?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Just that on his office wall there’s a
cartoon with a caption reading, “When you’ve got them by the balls,
their hearts and minds will follow.”</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hello, I’m Bob Woodward of the Washing
Post and… Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when
you expect Mr. Hunt? He is?</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: Howard Hunt here.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hi, I’m Bob Woodward of the Post and–</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: –yes, yes, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I was just kind of wondering why your name
and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at
Watergate?</p>
<p><strong>hunt</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I’m sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett, but
we’re doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard
Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>bennett</strong>: Well, if you’ve been doing some
investigating then obviously it’s no secret to you that Howard was with
the C.I.A.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: No secret at all.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward, of
the Washington Post–get me Personnel–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hi, I’m Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post–and–what’s that?–you’ve never heard of me?–I can’t help that–you
don’t believe I’m with the Post?– what do you want me to do, Madam,
shout “extra–extra”?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Whaddya got, whaddya got?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hunt is Colson’s man– –that’s Charles
Colson, Nixon’s special counsel– –they both went to Brown University–
–Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till ’70, and this is on deep background,
the FBI thinks he’s involved with the break-in.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: What else have you got?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: According to White House personnel, Hunt
definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the
White House Press office, they said he hadn’t worked there for three
months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me. “I am convinced
that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any
knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the
Democratic National Committee.”</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: Isn’t that what you’d expect them to
say?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I never asked them about Watergate. I only
said what were Hunt’s duties at the White House. They volunteered that
he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: I think we got a White House consultant
linked to the bugging.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: Just be careful how you write it.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Here’s the first take–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: This is all of it, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What the hell were you doing rewriting my
story–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –I sure couldn’t hurt it, could I?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –it was fine the way it was–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –it was bullshit the way it was–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I have to stand here and listen to the
staff correspondent from Virginia?–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –what have you been here, nine months?–I
been in this business since I was sixteen–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –and you’ve had some fucking meteoric
rise, that’s for sure–by the time you turn forty you might be the head
of the Montana bureau–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –you only got the job because both you
and Bradlee went to Yale–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –Bradlee went to Harvard–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –they’re all the same, all those Ivy
League places–they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you’re
smart–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I’m smart enough to know my story was
solid–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –mine’s better–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –no way–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –read ’em both and you’ll see–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: …crap…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Is mine better?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What is it about my writing that’s so
rotten?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Mainly it has to do with your choice of
words.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Carl?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Fuck you, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You heard? They put us both on the
break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together. Listen, I’m
sorry I said your story was bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It’s OK; I’m sorry I called you a
failure.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Forget it, the main thing– –did you call
me a failure?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I was sure trying.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: All right, what do we know?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Let me lay a little theory on you–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I’m not interested in theory. What do we
know? For example, Hunt’s disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of
the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: And McCord was carrying an application for
college press credentials for the Democratic convention. The Times has
got to be full of it– it can’t be crazy Cubans.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What, though? It can’t be the
Republicans–he’d never allow something as stupid as this, not when he’s
gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Right. Nixon didn’t get where he got by
being dumb– –listen, that was a Watergate question–</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: The White House has had no involvement
whatever in this particular incident.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hey?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What do you think he meant, this
particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know
anyone important?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I lived here all my life, I got a million
contacts, but they’re all bus boys and bellhops.</p>
<p><strong>ringle</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Someone inside the White House would be
nice.</p>
<p><strong>ringle</strong>: Call her. She worked for Colson, if that’s
any help.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Kenny’s crazy, I never worked for Colson, I
worked for an assistant. Colson was big on secrets anyway. Even if I had
worked for him, I wouldn’t have known anything.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Nothing at all you can remember?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sorry. Now if it was Hunt you were
interested in–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –Howard Hunt?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice
person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Any idea what he did?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was
investigating Kennedy–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –Teddy Kennedy?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sure. I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the
White House Library and the Library of Congress and–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: White House Library, please.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: One moment.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Library.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington
Post. I was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books
that Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: I think I do remember, he took out a
whole bunch of material. Let me just go see.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –what do you think?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –Hunt doesn’t seem like your ordinary
consultant.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Maybe a political operative of some
sort–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –a spy, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: It makes sense; Hunt worked for the
C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Mr. Bernstein?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: What I said before? I was wrong. The
truth is, I don’t have a card that Mr. Hunt took out any Kennedy
material. I remember getting that material out for somebody, but it
wasn’t Mr. Hunt. The truth is, I’ve never had any requests at all from
Mr. Hunt. The truth is, I don’t know Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: You want all the material requested by
the White House?</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: All White House transactions are
confidential.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You think they are confidential? I don’t
know anything about how this town works, I haven’t lived here a year
yet.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We need a sympathetic face.</p>
<p><strong>young clerk</strong>: You want every request since when?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: When did Hunt start at the White
House?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: July of ’71.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: About the past year.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m not sure you want ’em, but I got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I can’t believe you guys are actually doing
this.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You do a lot of things when you’re on a
story. Can you believe we’re actually doing this?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: That was fun. What now?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I met a Presidential aide once at a social
occasion.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: And you haven’t called him?–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: You got accurate notes on the White House
librarian? OK, we’ll leave space for the White House denial and we
should be set.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Benjy, we got a present for you. Above
the fold on page one for sure. It may not change our lives one way or
the other. Just a good, solid piece of American Journalism– –that The
New York Times doesn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: You haven’t got it. A librarian and a
secretary say Hunt looked at a book. Not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I was told by this guy at the White House
that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: How senior?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You asking me to disclose my source?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Just tell me his title.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I don’t know titles.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Is he on the level of Assistant to the
President or not?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Get some harder information next time.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: I saw the flag signal–what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Nothing, that’s the problem–the story’s
gone underground.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: You thought I’d help out on specifics?
I’ll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but
that’s all. Are you guys really working? How much?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I don’t know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours
a day–we’ve got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it’s still drying
up.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Then there must be something, mustn’t
there. Look, forget the myths the media’s created about the White House–
the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of
hand.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: If you don’t like them, why won’t you be
more concrete with me?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Because the press stinks too–history on
the run, that’s all you’re interested in. You come up with anything?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to
spend more time with his family. That doesn’t exactly have the ring of
truth. Howard Hunt’s been found–there was talk that his lawyer had 25
thousand in cash in a paper bag.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Follow the money. Always follow the
money.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: To where?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: This man Gordon Liddy–he’s going to be
tried along with Hunt and the five burglars–we know he knows a lot, we
just don’t know what.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: You changed cabs? You’re sure no one
followed you?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I did everything you said, but it all
seemed–</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: –melodramatic? Things are past
that–remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the
world as if it were Dodge City.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What’s the whole thing about–do you
know?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: What I know, you’ll have to find out on
your own.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Liddy–you think there’s a chance he’ll
talk?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his
hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame
until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, “What’s the
trick?” And he replied. “The trick is not minding.”</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: The fucking New York Times.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Goddamnit–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –see?–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –I’m trying–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –fifteen phone calls–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: —fifteen or more phone calls from the
burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Why didn’t we get that?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Christ, and I even know somebody at the
phone company–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –you do?–with access to records?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Why couldn’t you have just dialed me from
the office, Irwin?</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: ’Cause I’m not calling out from the phone
company anymore– –I think the place is bugged.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: So tell me about the Times article.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: No games, Irwin; give.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: My big civil rights buddy– –boy, if John
Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming. What’re
you onto?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Something maybe big.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: And that makes anything you do OK, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Just tell me about the goddamn
article.</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: It was accurate, but I can’t get a fuller
listing for you–all Barker’s phone records have been subpoenaed.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Who by?</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating
is named Martin Dardis.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something
like this–you know that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>irwin</strong>: Don’t give me any more of your liberal shit,
OK, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Harry, I just talked to a Miami
investigator about Barker–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –so?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I think it might be helpful if you’d send
me to Miami.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: I’m the one sent you to Toronto,
Bernstein–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –that was awhile ago–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –“I think it might be helpful if you’d
send me to Toronto.” That was your spiel then. “The Lifestyles of
Deserters.” I’m still waiting for it.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Down to Miami and back–how much damage
can I do?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: You’re the fella who forgot he rented a
Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn’t forget to send us the
bill?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: I can predict the next words you’re gonna
say: “anyone but Bernstein.” I want to send a reporter to Miami.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: Anyone but Bernstein.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Howard–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –remember Toronto, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: That was awhile ago.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: I don’t get it–you were the one who wanted
to fire him.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: I know, I did, but damnit Howard– For the
first time since I’ve known him, I think he’s really humping…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Yeah? Yes, this is Carl Bernstein. You’re
repossessing my bicycle? Listen, I’m sure I paid this month’s
installment, so why don’t you check your records before you go around
hassling people? Oh…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Hannah, I never would have bothered you
but I’m off to Miami and they’re gonna take away my ten speed unless I
get it straightened out fast.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Where are your bills, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Oh, they’re here. I’m keeping much better
records now, Hannah. See?</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Carl, it’s a jungle. I suggest you either
pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles. You’d give a
stranger the shirt off your back–except it wouldn’t be paid for.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Hey… very tense.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Lot of pressure at the Star. Carl, when we
got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you
were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of
my life, and now look at this. How much did the damn bike cost?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Five hundred; six maybe.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You’re two months behind–you got enough to
cover?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I think.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Give me your checkbook then.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: It’s right under that pile.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: I thought you had to get to Miami.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: There’s always a later plane.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: You’re a sex junkie, you know that,
Carl?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Nobody’s perfect. I’m glad you’re out of
it, Hannah– you’re a terrific reporter and I turned you into a
bookkeeper.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: Aw baby, you can get it up… I just wonder if
you’ll ever be able to get it together.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Hi, it’s me. I’m still here.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’m so glad.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I’d really like to see Mr. Dardis.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: And you will. But not now.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I called him from Washington. He’s the
one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I told you, he had to go out on a
case.</p>
<p><strong>uniformed cop</strong>: Is it OK to go on back?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car
radio?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He is not in the car. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Hey, babe.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Mr. Dardis does call in every so
often?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Well of course.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Good. Just tell him I was here, that I’m
sorry I missed him–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Mr. Dardis’ office, please.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Dardis’ office.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: This is Mr. Tomlinson in the clerk’s
office. Could you come across the hall for a moment? We’ve got some
documents your boss probably should see.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dardis.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Carl Bernstein’s here to see you–I don’t
know why, but he seems angry–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Look, you’ve been jerking my chain all
day. If there’s some reason you can’t talk to me–like the fact that
you’ve already leaked everything to The New York Times–just say so.</p>
<p><strong>dardis</strong>: Listen, I’ve got a dinner–can’t we do this
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I’m on deadline.</p>
<p><strong>dardis</strong>: You want Barker’s phone stuff or his money
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>dardis</strong>: I’ll never get out of here in time.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: The telephone calls… we know about
that.</p>
<p><strong>dardis</strong>: The rest is Barker’s bank records. It’s
mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier’s checks–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –yeah, that was in The Times this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What’s this Dahlberg check?</p>
<p><strong>dardis’ voice</strong>: That the twenty-five grand one?–
Don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>dardis</strong>: I never could figure just who this Dahlberg
was. Think it might be anything?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: This? Naw…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –Woodward–Woodward, listen, I don’t know
what I got– –and I think the Times has it too– –but somewhere there’s a
Kenneth H. Dahlberg in this world and we’ve gotta find him–</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Were you after the Dahlberg articles
from the files? There aren’t any, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Whazzis?</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Our Dahlberg file.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein’s voice</strong>: Harry–I know how to get
Dahlberg–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –Woodward’s talking to him know.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –this should take only a minute,
Mr. Dahlberg, but we’re doing a follow- up on the break-in– –and I was
kind of curious about your check.</p>
<p><strong>dahlberg</strong>: …check…?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: The twenty-five thousand dollar one. The
one with your name on it. In Bernard Barker’s Florida account. Bernard
Barker, the Watergate burglar–</p>
<p><strong>dahlberg</strong>: …you’re definitely doing a story…?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dahlberg</strong>: I’m a proper citizen, I’m a decent man, I
don’t do anything that isn’t decent or proper. I know I shouldn’t tell
you this…</p>
<p><strong>dahlberg</strong>: That twenty-five thousand dollars is money
I collected for Nixon in this year’s campaign.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I see. And how do you think it reached
Miami?</p>
<p><strong>dahlberg</strong>: I don’t know; I really don’t. The last
time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance
department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to
that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: That checks out with our finding, thank
you, Mr. Dahlberg.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: CREEP financed the Watergate break- in,
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: One sec’–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –OK, last go-round. Foreign, anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: National?</p>
<p><strong>national editor</strong>: I’ll stand with the Eagleton
follow- ups and McGovern not being able to get a replacement–that’s your
page one stuff right there, Howard–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –Metropolitan?–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –you are ignoring the importance of the
Dahlberg repercussions–</p>
<p><strong>national editor</strong>: –nobody gives a shit about the
Dahlberg repercussions–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –quit equivocating, say what you mean–
–our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP’s
finances–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –and we printed that, didn’t we, Harry? And
when the frigging audit’s done, we’ll print that too–</p>
<p><strong>national editor</strong>: –let me tell what happened when I
was having lunch today at the Sans Souci–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –correction–when you were drinking your
lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci–</p>
<p><strong>national editor</strong>: –this White House guy, a good one,
a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys
and I said, well, we think it’s important and he said, if it’s so
goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Ask him what he’s really saying–he means
take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the
National Desk–</p>
<p><strong>national editor</strong>: –well, I’ve got some pretty
experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn’t you say so?–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –absolutely–and that’s all they do, sit
sit sit–every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some
reporting–</p>
<p><strong>national editor</strong>: –well, what if your boys get it
wrong–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Then it’s our asses, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: And we’ll all have to go to work for a
living.</p>
<p><strong>foreign editor</strong>: I don’t think either Metropolitan or
National should cover the story. I don’t think we should cover the
story, period.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>foreign editor</strong>: It’s not that we’re using unnamed
sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House
denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: What then?</p>
<p><strong>foreign editor</strong>: I don’t believe the goddamn story,
Howard, it doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: It will, it just hasn’t bottomed out yet,
give it time.</p>
<p><strong>foreign editor</strong>: Ben, Jesus, there are over two
thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did
we suddenly get all this wisdom?</p>
<p><strong>foreign editor</strong>: Look–why would the Republicans do
it? –my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes–just like
Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of ’em. Why would the burglars have put
the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to
get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off,
unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord–the only
direct contact to the Republicans?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: You saying the Democrats bugged
themselves?</p>
<p><strong>foreign editor</strong>: The FBI thinks it’s possible–the
Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption’s always a good one. Get off
the story, Ben–or put some people on McGovern’s finances; fair is fair,
even in our business.</p>
<p><strong>union guy</strong>: who’s reading over</p>
<p><strong>second union guy</strong>: Politics as usual, someone just
got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>union guy</strong>: Big fuckin’ cookie jar.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: This is practically a high school reunion
for us, Jane–I would have sprung for a classier place.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Anyplace really public, they’d know about
it–they know everything at the Committee, Carl–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –you don’t really think you’re being
followed?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the
other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn’t
ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she’d done. They control
everything; that’s how they know it all.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: FBI too?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You don’t believe me? Well, I was working the
weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running
around like crazy–you had to practically wait in line to use the
shredding machine–and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even
asked me about it.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: If you don’t like it down there, why
don’t you quit?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t know what they’d do to me.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Hey, easy…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: We’re a long way from high school, Carl… …and
I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>jane’s voice</strong>: They found out I saw you– –they wanted
to know everything. Don’t call me again.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I can help if you’ll–</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: –stay away from me, Carl!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: We have no one by the name of Mitchell
registered.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: My mistake, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Get me John Mitchell, it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: That would be room 710, I’ll connect
you.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: The Mitchells.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Can I speak to Martha Mitchell,
please.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I’ve met Mrs. Mitchell in Washington, I’m
Bob Woodward of the Post and tell her–</p>
<p><strong>first maid</strong>: We’ll be back after lunch.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: We’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>second maid</strong>: I think they went out.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I don’t mind waiting.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: See her? Get anything?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: For the paper, no; for us, plenty. I
waited a long time and finally this big guy–I guess a bodyguard– he left
and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: And?–And?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –she was panicked, Carl–every time I
mentioned Watergate, you could tell.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Were you eyebrow reading?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It was there. I just don’t get it; a CREEP
secretary being scared, that’s one thing. But what does the wife of one
of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of…?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Left up ahead.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Who’s first?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list,
Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Now hang your second right– –this was my
turf when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I brought you over one street too many–go
back and hang a left again.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I don’t get it… this really was my
turf…</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You’re not a kid anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen
and wearing my only grown-up suit–it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head
copy boy comes running up to me and says, “My God, haven’t you washed
the carbon paper yet? If it’s not washed by three, it’ll never by dry
for tomorrow.” And I said, “Am I supposed to do that?” and he said,
“Absolutely, it’s crucial.” So I run around and grab all the carbon
paper from all the desks and take it to the men’s room. I’m standing
there washing it and it’s splashing all over me and the editor comes in
to take a leak, and he says, “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?”
And I said, “It’s 2:30. I’m washing the carbon paper.”</p>
<p>****: Just wanted you to know I’ve done dumber things than get us
lost, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hi. I’m Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post and I hate to bother you at home–</p>
<p><strong>sweet old lady</strong>: –I already get the Post. I don’t
need another subscription.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: No, I’m a reporter. I wanted to talk to
you about the Committee to Re- Elect.</p>
<p><strong>sweet old lady</strong>: The what to what?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You work there, Miss Abbott.</p>
<p><strong>sweet old lady</strong>: I’m not Miss Abbott.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Miss Abbott?</p>
<p><strong>miss abbott</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We’re from the Washington Post and we
wanted to ask you some questions about the Committee.</p>
<p><strong>miss abbott</strong>: I’m sorry–</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: God, it’s just so awful–</p>
<p><strong>a young girl</strong>: –I can’t–I’d like to but–</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: –go–you’ve got to go before they see
you–please–</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: –no… good…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You had the Mighty Mo and the fries
without gravy, right?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: This is terrific work, if you like
rejection.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I never scared anyone before.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It’s not us, they were scared before we
got there. What do we know?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Facts or theory?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Anything you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We know there’s got to be something or
they wouldn’t be so panicked.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: And that something’s got to be more than
just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars–those indictments are gonna be
bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I just wish we knew when someone would
talk to us, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: A friend at the Committee told us to
contact you–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: –who was it?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We never reveal our sources, which is why
you can talk to us.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It’s safe, try it, you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We understand your problem–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –you believe in the President, you
wouldn’t ever want to do anything disloyal.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We appreciate your position–really.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You people–you think that you can come into
someone’s life, squeeze what you want, then get out. You don’t
appreciate a goddamn thing, mister. And you don’t understand nothing.
But the Committee’s briefed us on you–so get the hell out of here– –do
you like scaring the life out of decent people?–’cause if you don’t, in
the name of God–stop it!</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: At Yale once, they held an auction. There
was this woman and her name was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came up for
sale. She had 1400 postcards written to her and I’d never heard of her
before but I knew I had to have those cards, I had to know why anyone
would get so many messages. I paid sixty-five dollars for them… I got
all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then I
found that her husband killed himself in Dayton, and once I had that, it
all began to open, an evangelist had come to Dayton and his horses hit
Lulu Landis at the corner of 13th and Vermillion and she was paralyzed.
Permanently, and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all
her friends, whenever they went anyplace, they wrote her. Those cards,
they were her eyes…</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: I know who you are and I’m not
afraid but that don’t mean I’ll talk to you either–you’re just a couple
Democrats out to stop Nixon getting re-elected.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Democrats?</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I hate both parties.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: And I’m a Republican.</p>
<p>****: Republican?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Who’d you vote for?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: ’68.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Nixon.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: Mitchell never left the Committee–
he resigned, sure, but he was there as much as before–</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: –oh, don’t worry, Gordon Liddy will be
happy to take the fall for everyone because, well, it’s not that
Gordon’s crazy, he’s… …weird. I’ll give you some Committee people who
know about him–only don’t tell it was me–</p>
<p><strong>younger woman</strong>: –of course we were briefed on what to
say–and never to volunteer anything–</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: –oh, we were never alone with the FBI,
there was always someone from the Committee right there–</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: …No one in this administration, presently
employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident…</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: …What really hurts in matters of this sort is
not the fact that they occur, because overzealous people in campaigns do
things that are wrong. What really hurts is if you try to cover it
up.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Did he just say what I think he said?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You voted for him.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Hi, I’m Carl Bernstein of the Washington
Post and–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: –oh, you don’t want me, you want my sister.
For you.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper’s sister</strong>: This here is Carl
Bernstein–</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: –omigod, you’re from that place, you’ve
got to go.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Could I bum one of your cigarettes?–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –don’t bother, I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: You’ve really got to go.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Just let me get a match.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: But I want you to know that I understand
why you’re afraid–a lot of good people down there at the Committee are
afraid. I’m really sorry for what you’re being put through.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: All those articles you people write–
where do you find that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We don’t tell anyone that. Which is why
you can talk to us. And if we can’t verify what you say someplace else,
we don’t print it. That’s another reason you can relax.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: I’m relaxed–light your cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You were Hugh Sloan’s bookkeeper when he
worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did
you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time
lapse?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: I never worked for Sloan or Stans.</p>
<p>****: Would you like some coffee or anything?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Please, yes, thank you.</p>
<p>****: Can I sit down for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: One minute but then–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –right, right, I’ve got to go. Why did
you lie just then?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I was just curious–you don’t do it well,
so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: …No… never in so many words…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: It’s obvious you want to talk to
someone–well, I’m someone.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I’m not even going to put your name down.
It’s just so I can keep things straight. Start with the money, why don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper’s sister</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Everything, please.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper’s sister</strong>: I won’t be a minute.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: The General Accounting report said there
was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans’ safe. Did you know about
that from the beginning?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: There are too many people watching
me–they know I know a lot–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –it was all in hundreds, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: A lot of it was. I just thought it was
sort of an all-purpose political fund–you know, for taking fat cats to
dinner, things like that.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: I can’t be positive that it was used for
the break-in but people sure are worried.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Which people?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: The ones who could disburse the
money.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Who were they?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: There were a group of them–I think five,
I don’t know their names.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Sloan knew which five, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper’s sister</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: I don’t want to say anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: It’s awfully hot– –and you haven’t
finished telling me about the money–</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: –omigod, there was so much of it, six
million came in one two-day period– six million cash, we couldn’t find
enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til
after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Gordon Liddy, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: It was all so crazy–the day after the
break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that
loony way of his–Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin
everything–don’t let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just
know that when Gordon Liddy’s calling someone a bad apple, something’s
wrong somewhere. …It’s all so rotten… and getting worse… and all I care
about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn’t stand
up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and
didn’t want any part of it.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Think Sloan’s being set up as a fall guy
for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>bookkeeper</strong>: If you guys… if you guys could just get
John Mitchell… that would be beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I couldn’t believe what she told me.
Eight cups of coffee worth.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Go on, go on–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –we’ve got to find out who the five guys
are–the five with access to the slush fund–they were aware of the
break-in.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Then tomorrow’s grand jury indictments
will just be bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: It goes very high–we’ve got to find out
where–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –we will–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –she was really paranoid, the
bookkeeper.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: That happens to people. OK, go on.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: How do you want to handle Sloan?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You mean, who’s going to play the mean
M.P. and who’s going to be the nice one? Whichever.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: He’s another Ivy Leaguer so he’ll
probably expect you to be understanding–might surprise him if you’re
not.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You want me to be the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: And I’ll just shitkick in my usual
way.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: To see Mr. Sloan.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sloan</strong>: He’s out. You’re those two from the
Post, aren’t you. I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: This must be a difficult time for the
both of you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sloan</strong>: This is an honest house.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: That’s why we wanted to see your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sloan</strong>: That decision is up to him.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Maybe you could put in a good word.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We’ve got another appointment tonight in
this area–we’ll just stop back later, all right?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sloan</strong>: It’s a free country– –in theory.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sloan</strong>: Be careful–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sloan</strong>: –you can destroy lives.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Think Sloan’s back? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Nothing–I just found out that Jeb
Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am. I never like it
when the other guy’s human…</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Mr. Sloan?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: My wife told me to expect you. As you know, I
haven’t talked to the press.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We were hoping that maybe now you could.
We know why you left the Committee. We know you’re not guilty of
anything. But we know you know who is–</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: –look, come in. We’ll have to be quiet–my
wife’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’d like to talk to you, I really would, but
my lawyers say I shouldn’t until after the Watergate trial.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You handed out the money. Maybe there’s a
legitimate explanation for the way it was done–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –then again, maybe things are even worse
than we’ve written–</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: –they’re worse. That’s why I quit.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Try and understand this. I’m a decent
Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four
years–so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don’t think the
President knew anything about. Some of his men I’m not so sure of.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Do you think the truth will come out at
the trial?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: That’s another of the things I’m not so sure
of.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Because people at the Committee were told
to lie to the prosecutors?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We were never told flat out “Don’t talk.” But
the message was clear.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: To cover up?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Well, they sure didn’t ask us to come forward
and tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Does “they” mean the White House?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: As opposed to the Committee? The Committee’s
not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White
House. I don’t think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand
that.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: The report on the cash in Maurice Stans’
safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that’s true?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: No. It was closer to seven hundred
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: And as treasurer, you could release those
funds?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: When so ordered.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We’re not sure we’ve got all the guys who
could order you, but we know there were five.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they’re
obvious–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –there had to be a White House
overseer–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –Colson.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Colson’s too smart to get directly involved
with something like that.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Haldeman. Right?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I won’t talk about the other two.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: But they both worked at the White
House?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I will not talk about the other two.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Kalmbach–Nixon’s personal lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I can’t say anything, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: One thing I’m not completely clear on–when
you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Badly. You don’t realize how close all this
came to staying undiscovered–I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave
it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in
hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me
and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for
what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave
him–out of this whole fortune–I happened to give him the same hundreds
he gave me–banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been
in fifties, or if I’d grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn’t
have been any Watergate story.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Ordinarily, though, what was the
procedure?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Routine–I’d just call John Mitchell over at
the Justice Department and he’d say “go ahead, give out the money.”</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What happens when the baby comes?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: We’re moving. I’ve been looking for a job but
it’s been… hard. My name’s been in the papers too much. Sometimes I
wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just
one sentence. I’m not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it’s
been very rough on them.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I wish I could put down on paper what it’s
like–you come to Washington because you believe in something, and then
you get inside and you see how things actually work and you watch your
ideals disintegrate. The people inside, the people in the White House,
they start to believe they can suspend the rules because they’re
fulfilling a mission. That becomes the only important thing– the
mission. It’s so easy to lose perspective. We want to get out before we
lose ours altogether.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Look–five men controlled that slush fund
as CREEP–three of them we’ve got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we’re
pretty sure of Kalmbach.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We’d like to wait til we have all five
before we print it.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: This is a daily paper, we’ll explain it
tomorrow. You’re certain on Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: He approved the payments to Liddy while he
was still Attorney General–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –you got more than one source?–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –yes–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –has any of them got an ax?–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –political, personal, sexual, anything at
all against Mitchell?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –no–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –can we use their names?–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –no–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –goddamnit, when’s somebody gonna go on the
record on this story–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –who you got?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –well, Sloan–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –and we got a guy in Justice–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –Deep Throat?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I saw him. He verifies.</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: You’re about to write a story that says that
the former Attorney General– the man who represented law in America– is
a crook. Just be right, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Leave plenty of room for his denial.</p>
<p><strong>operator’s voice</strong>: Essex House, can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: John Mitchell, please.</p>
<p><strong>john mitchell’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the
Washington Post, and I’m sorry to bother you but we’re running a story
in tomorrow’s paper that we thought you should have a chance to comment
on.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: John N. Mitchell, while serving as US
Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that–</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: –jeeeeeeesus–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –fund that was used to gather information
against the Democrats–</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: –jeeeeeeesus–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –according to sources involved in the
Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971–</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: –jeeeeeeesus–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –almost a year before he left the Justice
Department–</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: –jeeeeeeeeesus–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –to become President Nixon’s campaign
manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the
fund–</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: –all that crap, you’re putting it in the
paper? It’s all been denied. You tell your publisher–tell Katie Graham
she’s gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that’s published.
Good Christ! That’s the most sickening thing I ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Sir, I’d like to ask you a few–</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: –what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: 11:30.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Morning or night?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Night.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: He really made that remark about
Mrs. Graham? This is a family newspaper–cut the words “her tit” and run
it.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Once when I was reporting, Lyndon Johnson’s
top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to J. Edgar
Hoover. I wrote it and the day it appeared Johnson called a press
conference and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life… And when he
was done, he turned to his top guy and the President said, “Call Ben
Bradlee and tell him fuck you.” I took a lot of static for that–
everyone said, “You did it, Bradlee, you screwed up–you stuck us with
Hoover forever–” –I screwed up but I wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: You guys haven’t been wrong yet, is that
why you’re scared shitless? You should be…</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Although I am a Republican, I would like to
state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I feel only sadness that a once
fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the
hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the
Democratic Party–</p>
<p><strong>creep p.r. man</strong>: –hearsay, innuendo, and character
assassination. I can only conclude that the so-called sources of the
Washington Post are a fountain of misinformation–</p>
<p><strong>white house spokesman</strong>: –the White House has long
since stopped being surprised at this type of reporting by certain
elements of the Eastern liberal press–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: Same kind of crap–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –all non-denial denials–we’re dirty guys
and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don’t say the story is
inaccurate.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What’s a real denial?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: If they ever start calling us goddamn
liars– –it’s time to start circling the wagons.</p>
<p><strong>first union guy</strong>: You think they know what they’re
doing on the fifth floor?</p>
<p><strong>second union guy</strong>: I got eight kids to support–they
better.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see
me for?</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: Maybe to fire you–since you two started on
this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? And the word
is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I’m not saying
she’s going on relief, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable for her to
want to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You think she wants us to ease up on the
story?</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: I don’t know, but I don’t think that’s
unreasonable either, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: I’m so glad you could come, Mr.–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I’m Woodward.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: You know, the paper was my father’s and
my husband’s when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two
ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers
the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore
of them and all my legal counsel said “don’t, don’t” and I was
frightened but I knew if I said no, I’d lose the whole fifth floor. So
we published, and that night, after I’d told Ben to go ahead, I woke up
in the darkness and I thought, “Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this
newspaper?” I woke up again last night with that same question. Are we
right on this story?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: When will you be, do you think?– when
are we going to know it all?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It may never come out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: Never? Please don’t tell me never. Ben
says you’ve found some wonderful sources.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI
man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: And the underground garage one. Would I
know him?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I couldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: But it’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: You’ve never told anyone who he is? But
you’d have to tell me if I asked you. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I would, if you really ever wanted to
know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: I really want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: I wasn’t serious. I have plenty of
burdens to carry around, I don’t need another.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: We’re going to need lots of good luck,
aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Nobody ever had too much.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. graham</strong>: Do better.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: I thought you guys were supposed to be
working on this story– –you think I like being aced out?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –what?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –The L.A. Times has a huge interview with
Baldwin–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –the lookout in the Motor Inn?– –he say
anything we don’t know?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –just that a lot of reports were sent to
CREEP, but he doesn’t name who, not here anyway–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –it would have been nice to have had this,
I sure would have liked to have had this–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –there’s nothing new in it–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –it makes the break-in real–it’s a major
goddamn story– –I’m not going to kick ass over this, but I’d like you to
know I hate getting beat, I just hate it– don’t forget that I hate
it–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Goddamnit–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –shit–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –we gotta top the Times–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I know, I know–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –if we could name the guys got the
reports, we’d be ahead again–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –shit, who do we know?–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –I know a lawyer at Justice–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –has he got an ax?–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –almost every source we’ve used has been
Republican, this guy’s a card- carrying Democrat.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Then he’s got an ax. Call him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>first union guy</strong>: Who is this Woodstein? Two stories
on the front page.</p>
<p><strong>second union guy</strong>: If he can’t pick a winner at
Pimlico, to hell with him.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –I want you to shut up and listen to
me–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I haven’t said anything–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –for the first time I’m beginning to feel
like a fucking reporter– Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with
a tip– –someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and
asked them if they’d like to go to work with him screwing up the
Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti–
Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him–they interrogated him,
but on account of Segretti wasn’t involved with the break-in, they
didn’t follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling–he called
these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans
knew what he was doing.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: How high up, which Republicans?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: That’s what we’ve got to find out, but
Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –Haldeman I know, who else?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Dwight Chapin, Nixon’s appointments
chief–he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I’m crazy, but this is the first
time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: The burglary was done by Cubans or
Democrats or Republicans.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Now the reason no one believed the
Republicans is because there wasn’t any reason, they were so far ahead.
But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break-
in.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: So maybe Watergate wasn’t really about
Watergate–maybe that was just a piece–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –because a year before, the Republicans
weren’t ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then.
Before he self- destructed.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: If he self-destructed.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Segretti criss-crossed the country over
ten times in six months–and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.
Switch to another station, huh? You’re driving me crazy with that.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Segovia begged me for me secret but I
said, “No, Andres, you’ll have to try and make it without me.”</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: California, Illinois, Florida, New
Hampshire–all the major Democratic primary states. Why does everything
you play sound the same?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –’cause I only know four chords–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Donald Segretti?</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I’m Carl Bernstein. My paper sent me out
to see if I couldn’t persuade you to go on the record.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Mind if I try?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: According to what we’ve been able to
verify, you’ve been busy.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: I’ve got a lot of energy.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Listen–we know you’re involved in
this–we’re going to get the story, why not help?</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: They never told me anything except my own
role–I had to find out the rest in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: By “they” you mean…?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: By “they” you mean the White House, don’t
you? Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin– he works for the White
House.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: I know where Dwight works.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: When did he hire you?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Do you feel much about the things you
did?</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: I didn’t do anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Tell that to Muskie.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: During the Florida primary, you wrote a
letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child.
You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe–
–off the record.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You wrote the Canuck letter–the one where
you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: But you know who did.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: When you guys print it in the paper, then
I’ll know. I’m a lawyer, and I’ll probably go to jail, and be disbarred,
and what did I do that was so awful?</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: None of it was my idea, Carl–I didn’t go
looking for the job.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Chapin did contact you then?</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: Sure–off the record.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: On the orders of Haldeman?</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: I don’t know anything about Haldeman,
except, Dwight’s frightened of him– everybody’s frightened of
him–Christ, I wish I’d never gotten messed around with this–all I wanna
do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: It gets interesting if it was Haldeman,
because our word is that when Chapin says something, he’s gotten the OK
from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he’s gotten the OK from
the President.</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: Can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: At USC, you had a word the this– screwing
up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.
Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them
all?</p>
<p><strong>segretti</strong>: What would you have done if you were just
getting out of the Army, if you’d been away from the real world for four
years, if you weren’t sure what kind of law you wanted to practice, and
then one day you got a call from an old friend asking you to go to work
for the President of the United States…?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What would you have done?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You asking would I have been one of the
President’s men? I would have been.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: My turn to keep you waiting. What’s the
topic for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Ratfucking.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: In my day, it was simply called the
double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our
context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I know what it means–Segretti wouldn’t go
on the record, but if he would, we know he’d implicate Chapin. And that
would put us inside the White House.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Yes, the little ratfuckers are now
running our government.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Who?–be specific. How high up?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: You’ll have to find that out, won’t
you.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: The slush fund at CREEP financed the
ratfucking, we’ve almost got that nailed down, so–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Did you change cabs? It didn’t work,
something moved there–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Here. Forget your troubles and just be
happy.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved
under the threat of discovery.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Do Justice and the FBI know what we know,
and why the hell haven’t they done anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: They know, but they focused on the
burglary–if it didn’t deal with the break-in, they didn’t pursue it.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Why didn’t they?–who told them not to?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Someone with authority I’d imagine,
wouldn’t you? Don’t you know what you’re onto? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Mitchell knew then.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Of course–my God, you think something
this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell
knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Haldeman too?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: You get nothing from me about
Haldeman?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Why did they do all this for
Chrissakes?–what were they after?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Total manipulation. I suppose you could
say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don’t think along
philosophical lines.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Talk about Segretti–</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: –don’t concentrate on Segretti or
you’ll miss the overall scheme too.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: There were more then.</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Follow every lead–every lead goes
somewhere–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –the Canuck letter–was that a White House
operation–</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: –don’t you miss the grand scheme
too.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: How grand?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Nationwide–my God, they were frightened
of Muskie and look who got destroyed–they wanted to run against
McGovern, and look who they’re running against. They bugged, they
followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled
Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives,
they planted spies, stole documents, on and on– don’t tell me you think
this was all the work of little Don Segretti.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: And Justice and FBI know all this?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: Yes, yes, everything. There were over
fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck– some of
what they did is beyond belief.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White
House to destroy the Democrats?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: I was being cautious. You can safely
say more then fifty…</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Do you guys know about the Canuck
letter?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Um-hmm. Why?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote
it.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Tell him what you just told me.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Just than Ken Clawsen–he used to be a
reporter here before he went to work for Nixon–I had him over for a
drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter. You did
want to know, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You think we’re being set up?–Christ,
Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the
White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It makes a crazy kind of sense– remember
that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of
the President’s staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of
Nixon.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You think this was Clawsen’s
initiation?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Could have won him a fraternity paddle
with a White House seal. God knows it worked.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: You claiming it was all a
misunderstanding, Ken?</p>
<p><strong>clawsen</strong>: Absolutely–Marilyn’s gotten it totally
wrong–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: She’s an awfully good reporter–I can’t
remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?</p>
<p><strong>clawsen</strong>: That’s a bullshit question, that’s a
question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where
did your talk with Berger happen?</p>
<p><strong>clawsen</strong>: Where? What do you mean, where?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some
restaurant–</p>
<p><strong>clawsen</strong>: –I’ve completely forgotten where it was,
except I know it wasn’t her apartment.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Non denial-denial, Marilyn–</p>
<p><strong>clawsen</strong>: For Chissakes, don’t tell them I came to
your place.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: I already told them.</p>
<p><strong>clawsen</strong>: Oh, that’s terrific, that’s just so
terrific, I’m thrilled you did that.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: I have a clear conscience.</p>
<p><strong>clawsen</strong>: Marilyn, I have a wife and a family and a
cat and a dog.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: I got Clawsen on hold–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –his dialing finger must be falling
off–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –what do you think?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –he went to her apartment and he told
her–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –if he did it or just said he did it, God
knows.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: I could care less about where it happened;
what happened is what counts.</p>
<p>****: Put him on. Ken, I’m sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were
having a crisis, what’s up, kid? Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled. A
wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken. Ken, I would never
print that you were in Marilyn’s apartment at night– unless, of course,
you force me to.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: It’s like they taught us at Harvard: few
things are as gratifying to the soul as having another man’s nuts in a
vise…</p>
<p><strong>white house spokesman</strong>: The story is based entirely
on hearsay and–</p>
<p><strong>creep p.r. man</strong>: –we at the Committee are continually
amazed at the creativity shown by the Washington Post–</p>
<p><strong>western senator</strong>: –although I am a Republican, I
would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I am happy that
this latest onslaught against the intelligence of the American people
will be wrapping fish tomorrow. I offer my condolences to the fish…</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: Speak.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: We’ve just been talking to Young–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –which Young?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Larry Young, a California lawyer–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –he was going to go into law practice
with Segretti.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: And?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –and he says Chapin hired Segretti–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –well and good, but when will he say it on
the record.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: He just did.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: He’ll give us a sworn statement.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We’re inside the White House now.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Look, I wanted to talk because things are
getting really hairy and there’s a couple of things we’ve got to be
careful of because–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –either of you want a drink or should I
order?– –because–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –because our cocks are on the chopping
block and you’ve got to be sure that you’re not just dealing with people
who hate Richard Nixon and want to get him through us. You see, I don’t
give a shit who’s President–I really don’t, it’s an adversary situation
between them and us and it’s always gonna be. I never had a closer
friend than Jack Kennedy and once I printed something that pissed him
off and for seven months I didn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You none of you know who I am, do you? You
screw me up good, you don’t even know what I look like.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: OK, you’ve had your preamble; who the hell
are you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Glenn Sedam–you wrote about me last week, you
said I was one of the guys at the Committee who was sent reports. You
were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Baldwin told the FBI it was you.</p>
<p><strong>sedam</strong>: Baldwin told the FBI it was someone whose
first name sounded like a last name. They showed him a list and he
picked me but it wasn’t me, it was Gordon Liddy. My phone hasn’t stopped
ringing, my wife’s hysterical, my kids think I’m mixed up with the
burglary, my friends don’t like me around all of a sudden.</p>
<p><strong>sedam</strong>: You fucked around my life, you two. I just
wanted to say thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: That didn’t sound to me like a non- denial
denial; could you have been wrong? You had a good source? Did he have an
ax?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: All right, you made a mistake maybe, we all
have, just don’t make another. And watch your personal lives, who you
hang around with. Someone once said the price of democracy is a
bloodletting every ten years. Make sure it isn’t our blood…</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I really can’t talk now–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –this’ll only take one second–</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: –my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are
arriving, I’m trying to get the house in some kind of shape.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: A boy or a girl?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: A girl. Melissa.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Where does this go?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –That cash fund that financed the
sabotaging of the Democrats–five guys had control–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –we’re working on the last guy now and
we’re going all the way–that fifth man was Haldeman.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: –I’m not your source on that–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –it’s gotta be Haldeman–someone from the
White House had to be involved–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –and it wasn’t Ehrlichman or Colson or the
President.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: No, none of those.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –that leaves Haldeman, period.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: I’m not your source on that.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –look, when the Watergate grand jury
questioned you, did you name names?</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: Of course–everything they asked–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –if we wrote a story that said Haldeman
controlled the fund?–</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: –let me put it this way: I’d have no problem
if you did.</p>
<p><strong>woodward’s voice</strong>: Hey?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: I think that’s him.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Haldeman.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Nah. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: What if I went up and introduced
myself–think he’d slug me?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Well, we are trying to ruin his life.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: It’s nothing personal, though.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Same as Magruder, I don’t like it when
they turn out to be human.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I wish we were investigating Attila the
Hun.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Maybe we are…</p>
<p><strong>pudgy man</strong>: –Goddamnit, I’m not gonna say it
again–you get nothing about Haldeman outta me–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –we don’t need it now, because tomorrow’s
story is about the FBI–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –about how all you supposed experts
really blew the whole investigation–</p>
<p><strong>fbi guy</strong>: –we didn’t miss so much–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –you never knew Haldeman had control of
the slush fund–</p>
<p><strong>fbi guy</strong>: –it’s all in our files–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –not about Haldeman–</p>
<p><strong>fbi guy</strong>: –yeah, Haldeman, John Haldeman.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –Jesus–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –he said John Haldeman, not Bob
Haldeman–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –I don’t know, I don’t know, it feels
thin–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –Christ, I wish I knew if we should print
this–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –listen, we didn’t make them do these
things–once they did, it’s our job to report it–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –go over your sources again–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –Sloan told the Grand Jury–he answered
everything they asked him– that means there’s a record somewhere–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –and the FBI confirms–what more do you
need?–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –listen, I love this country, you think I
want to bring it down?–I’m not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –Harry, weren’t you just arguing the
opposite way?–</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: –maybe I’m tense–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –well shit, we oughtta be tense– we’re
about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most
important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside
the White House– –it would be nice if we were right–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: –you double-checked both sources?–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –Bernstein, are you sure on this story?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Absolutely–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –what about you?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I’m sure–</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: –I’m not sure, it still feels thin–</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: BERNSTEIN, after a</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: How many fucking sources they think we
got?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –Deep Throat won’t confirm–I never thought
he was scared of anyone, but he’s scared of Haldeman.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I know a guy in the Justice Department
who was around the Grand Jury.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –We got twenty minutes to deadline–</p>
<p><strong>lawyer’s voice</strong>: …You shouldn’t ever call me like
this, Carl…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Will you confirm that Haldeman was
mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer’s voice</strong>: …I won’t say anything about
Haldeman… not ever…</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: All right–listen–it’s against the law if
you talk about the Grand Jury, right? But you don’t have to say a
thing–I’ll count to ten–if the story’s wrong, hang up before I get
there–if it’s OK stay on the line till after, got it?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Hang up, right?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Right, right–OK, counting: one, two–
–three, four, five, six– –seven, eight– –nine, ten, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: You’ve got it straight now? Everything</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>white house spokesman</strong>: On the record let me say just
this: the story is totally untrue. On background, I’d like to add that
Bob Haldeman is one of the greatest public servants this country has
ever had and the story is a goddamned lie.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Woodstein!</p>
<p><strong>schorr</strong>: Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment on your
testimony before the Grand Jury.</p>
<p><strong>sloan</strong>: My lawyer says–</p>
<p><strong>sloan’s lawyer</strong>: –the answer is an unequivocal no.
Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman in that testimony at all.</p>
<p><strong>fbi man</strong>: –I’ll deny everything–everything– I never
talked to you about Haldeman– I never talked to you about anything– I’m
not talking to you now–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: –what went wrong?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –for Chrissakes just tell that–</p>
<p><strong>pudgy fbi man</strong>: –fuck you fuck you fuck you–</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: Woodward?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: What was the mistake? Do you think it’s
been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to
us when it mattered? They couldn’t have set us up better; after all
these months our credibility’s gone, you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Only everything…</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: More denunciations?</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: One Senator just gave a speech slurring
us 57 times in 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>simons</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: My non-denial denial.</p>
<p><strong>rosenfeld</strong>: We’re not printing a retraction?</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Fuck it, let’s stand by the boys.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein’s voice</strong>: What’d you find?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Jesus Christ, what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: You overslept?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Goddamnit!–</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: –you were doing so well and then you
got stupid, you went too fast– Christ, what a royal screw up–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I know, I know, the pressure’s off the
White House and it’s all back on the Post–</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: –you’ve done worse than let Haldeman
slip away, you’ve got people feeling sorry for him–I didn’t think that
was possible. A conspiracy like this– the rope has to tighten slowly
around everyone’s neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step
by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more
secure. You’ve put the investigation back months.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We know that–and if we were wrong, we’re
resigning–were we wrong?</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: You’ll have to find that out, won’t
you?–</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: –I’m tired of your chickenshit games– I
don’t want hints, I want what you know!</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: It was a Haldeman operation–the whole
business–he ran the money, but he was insulated, you’ll have to find out
how–</p>
<p><strong>deep throat</strong>: –wait– –there’s more…</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We gotta go see Bradlee–I’ll fill you in
in the car.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: You couldn’t have told me over the
phone?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: We can’t trust the phones, not anymore.
Deep Throat says so.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: We can’t talk inside either?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Electronic surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>bernstein</strong>: I finally got through to Sloan–it was all
a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about
Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the
goddamn question.</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: So I guess you could say that we screwed
up, but we weren’t wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Anything else from Mr. Throat?</p>
<p><strong>woodward</strong>: Mitchell started the cover-up early,
everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole
U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The
extent of it is incredible. And people’s lives are in danger, maybe
including ours.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: He’s wrong on that last, we’re not in the
least danger, because nobody gives a shit–what was that Gallup Poll
result? Half the country’s never even heard the word Watergate.</p>
<p><strong>bradlee</strong>: Look, you’re both probably a little tired,
right? You should be, you’ve been under a lot of pressure. So go home,
have a nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes if you want before you get
your asses back in gear– –because we’re under a lot of pressure, too,
and you put us there– not that I want it to worry you– nothing’s riding
on you except the First Amendment of the Constitution plus the freedom
of the press plus the reputation of a hundred-year-old paper plus the
jobs of the two thousand people who work there– –but none of that counts
as much as this: you fuck up again, I’m gonna lose my temper. I promise
you, you don’t want me to lose my temper. Move-move-move–what have you
done for me tomorrow…?</p>
<p><strong>western senator</strong>: Although I’m a Republican, I would
like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit tht the greatest political
scandal of this campaign is the brazen manner in which, without benefit
of clergy, the Washington Post has set up housekeeping with the McGovern
campaign…</p>
<p><strong>creep p.r. man</strong>: For twenty years, the Eastern
liberal press has been trying to smear Dick Nixon. Fortunately, the
American public is too smart to be fooled by…</p>
<p><strong>white house spokesman</strong>: I have been informed reliably
by John Dean that no one connected with the White House…</p>
<p><strong>western senator</strong>: It is only our pathetic Post that
deliberately tries to infuse the Watergate caper with a seriousness far
beyond those shenanigans that have been the stock trade of political
pranksters ever since…</p>
<p><strong>white house spokesman</strong>: An insult to the American
public–</p>
<p><strong>creep p.r. man</strong>: –the deplorable tactics employed by
the Washington Post–</p>
<p><strong>western senator</strong>: –I have been given access to
evidence in possession of the White House and that evidence–</p>
<p><strong>convicted, john ehrlichman, convicted, charles
colson,</strong>: CONVICTED, HERBERT KALMBACH, CONVICTED, and LARUE and
PORTER and MITCHELL and HALDEMAN–all, all the President’s men–
CONVICTED. Now–</p>
<p><strong>western senator</strong>: Well, if I was wrong, I sure the
hell wasn’t alone–</p>
<p><strong>creep</strong>: –the fact remains that except for Watergate,
we ran one hell of a great campaign…</p>
