<p><strong>american history x</strong>: screenplay by David McKenna
February 6, 1997</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Fucking pervert, Dan!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s a black guy outside Der… breaking
into your car.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How long has he been out there?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Not long.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Nobody. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Who’s out there, Derek?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not right now, honey. How many?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: One…I think.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Is he strapped?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hunh?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Does he have a fucking gun, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Is there a driver?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Okay. Stay the luck here.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Derek? Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Get down, Danny! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Captain Rasmussen?</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: Briefing room. Down that hall…third
door on the left.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: All right. Moving on– Good Morning,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney. He’s
Principal over at Venice High and for some time now he’s done a load of
outreach work with gangs…in and out of the can.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Three years ago a local kid named Derek
Vinyard gets sent up for murdering a couple of Crips who were trying to
jack his car. Bob taught Vinyard back in high school and has followed
the case closely.</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: He was a skinhead, right?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Derek was more like…the skinhead. He and
Cameron Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Cammeron Alexander is probably the
biggest writer and distributor of white power literature in LA County.
He promotes white power bands, writes reviews, columns, all at the ripe
age of forty.</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: He’s forty? Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Pretty clean record…runs everything out
of his house down by the beach.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: There weren’t any organized white gangs
around Venice before those two hooked up. Very few, if any. It was
mostly just black and Mexican. But it was tiny. They hit it off though…
and Alexander hit the jackpot with Derek.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: We got some uncut footage here. Courtesy
of NBC.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Earlier this evening…LA County Firefighter
Dennis Vinyard was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a
suspected Compton drug den.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: This being February of ’90.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: To my right I have Lieutenant Vinyard’s
oldest son Derek. How do you feel about all this, son?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How do I feel? How do you think I feel? It’s
typical.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Typical how, Derek?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well…look at our country. It’s a haven for
criminals. Black…brown… yellow…whatever.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: So you’re saying the murder of your father
is “race” related?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Every problem in this country is “race”
related. Every problem, not just crime. These problems are rooted in the
black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian…every non- Protestant
group in our society. Look at the shit. Immigration…
welfare…AIDS…they’re all the problems of the non-white. Look at the
statistics.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Most of these issues you’re referring to
though son are related to–</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No no no! Don’t say poverty right now cause
that’s not it. They’re not a product of our fucking environment either!
Minorities don’t give two shits about this country! They’re here to
exploit…not embrace.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: When Alexander got his hands on this
segment…he copied it, sent it out and it became the Gettysberg Address
for hate groups across the country.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Millions of white Europeans came to this
country and flourished within a generation! A generation! So what the
fuck is wrong with these people?!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What does any of this have to do with your
father?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Because my father was doing his fucking job!
Saving a nigger neighborhood he didn’t give two shits about! And he got
killed by some drug dealer who still collects a fucking welfare
check.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Vinyard was quietly released from Chino
on Saturday after three and some odd years. And I think it’s something
we might want to keep an eye on for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: I don’t wanna be an alarmist. But payback
is out there. I know it is. And in this particular case…if Vinyard gets
popped…more people will get popped.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: It’s not exactly LAPD policy but I want
24-hour surveillance on Vinyard for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Just for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>another cop</strong>: He doesn’t sound like Mr. Lovely here,
Captain. You want us to bust him or protect him?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: I don’t think Vinyard’s gonna be the one to
start anything. It’s his following.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Either way…let’s keep it low.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Hi Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey Lizzy.</p>
<p><strong>little henry</strong>: Tellin’ Baker I’m fuckin’ cheatin’?
I’ve never cheated in my life.</p>
<p><strong>buddy #1</strong>: Beat his ass, Henry!</p>
<p><strong>little henry</strong>: Why you trippin’ on me?</p>
<p><strong>daryl</strong>: I didn’t say anything, Henry. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>buddy #2</strong>: He’s lying, man! I was right there!</p>
<p><strong>little henry</strong>: Next time, man.</p>
<p><strong>offscreen voice</strong>: Vinyard!?</p>
<p><strong>older teacher</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>old teacher</strong>: But it looks like you got bigger
problems.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh, man! Come on. Get a job.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I do not have a problem with him as an
individual, alright!?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Oh shit Murray sure you do. You hate this
kid.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: This paper is a travesty, Bob! Arguing for
Hitler as a civil rights hero?! You’ve gotta draw a line.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Murray…it says in your syllabus that they
could do their report on any book related to the struggle for Civil
Rights.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Oh come on, Bob!</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Let me finish! He needs help…I’m not
disputing that. But I read it and I’m not going to throw him out.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: His brother probably put him up to it.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: I can guarantee you his brother didn’t have
anything to do with it, Murray.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Don’t let him walk scot-free here. For his
sake…not mine. You might be all he has left.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Thanks, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Okay. Get in here, Dan!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I knew it was you.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Shut up and get your ass in here!</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: What’s it gonna be, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s what going to be?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: This petty shit you’re pullin’.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well…I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: You said it, all right. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Any time you wanna talk, Dan–</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: How’s Derek?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Adjusting okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: He was a student of mine. Honors English.
He was a great student… like you…but he hung out with scumbags. Also
like you. That’s why he ended up in the pen, hunh?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Great writing. I can’t correct it though.
It wreaks too much of shit.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on, man! I followed directions and wrote
an “A” paper. It’s got nothing to do with Derek.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Everything you do now has something to do
with Derek. Who told you to do this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Let us get on with our lives, man!</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Hey, I’m not worried about Derek–he can
take care of himself. I’m worried about his little brother. Mein Kampf,
Dan? I should expel you!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Do it. What? You don’t think I could handle
it?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: The street would kill you, Danny. You’re
not tough. The second a brother pulls a gun on your ass you’ll be
holierin’ for Doris. So here’s the drill. Take it or leave it cause I’m
sick of babysitting. I’m your history teacher from here on out. We’re
gonna deal with shit happening right now. Call it American History…X. I
see your ass once a day. Any more, any less, and you’re a memory at
Venice High. Clear?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It took me a week to read Mein Kampf. Come
on, Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a
another paper on my desk tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What am I doing it on then?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: It’S not a “what”, it’s a “who.” Derek.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: People look at me…and they see my brother.
That’s how things have gone since the murder of our father.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Little Henry Hastings and his older brother
Jerome. Jerome’s a Shoreline Crip…Henry’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Venice Beach, man. It didn’t always look like
this. I mean…our Dad used to take us down here to run…and it was cool.
Derek fucking owned this place. Since then though…the gangs, man–</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: –they’ve moved west from Inglewood and South
Central and have really just…taken over. Especially at my high school.
The Venice Locos are big too but they hang out in bumluck Mar Vista.
It’s scary. And then there’s The Disciples of Christ. The D.O.C.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Seven-six. Let’s go! Set some picks!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Bring it on, boy.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Boy?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Lucky piece of shit! I’m through “monkeying”
around with your ass!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating,
cracker, motherfucker. A hundred bucks says I make you my bitch.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Here we go! Trying to make ends meet for that
cut in welfare.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s eight-six, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: When I want your fucking opinion I’ll ask for
it, fuckhead. Help me cover here, guys.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’ll take this negro down.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You can’t take a shit, Seth. Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I got a bet.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I come in, same score now, first one to
eleven. Black boys against the white boys.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Name your price, Cracker.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No money…for the court. We win, you grab your
shit and find a different place to run. Not just today… forever. You
win, and we don’t come back. No hitching, no fighting, here in front of
everyone. Six-eight, our ball.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You got a lot of fucking balls, man. Bring
it. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: It’s all you, Der!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Fuckin’ BYU, man! All right! All we need
is one now!</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Use that fat ass and keep him out,
Seth!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I ain’t losin’ in my house! Clear it
out!</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: That’s fuckin’ offense!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Get the fuck outta here! He was movin’ his
feet!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’ll go if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You wanna piece! Bring it!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: If you wanna go…I’m ready. Don’t be throwin’
fuckin’ elbows.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Hey. Are you copacetic?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: He’s gonna do that 180 spin move.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I know what he’s gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You gotta call offense on that shit.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not on point game you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Fuck that, D. That chucker can’t pull that
shit. It’s fucking-</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not on point, honey.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Get off my fucking court! This is my
house!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah! Fuck…yeah!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It was only the beginning. Derek once told me
that minorities would take America over one day. That white people are
too afraid. Maybe he was right.</p>
<p><strong>kammi</strong>: Hey! Danny!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: You’re going tonight, right?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: That party. Go there.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s dick for waves.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t care. I just wanna get wet.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve been trying to buy this. You can’t find
it anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Cammeron dropped us off a copy. Dope fucking
shit, man. It’s all about reclaiming the country. I’ll let you read it
when I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fuck that. I just read Mein Kampf.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey? What was this Daryl shit you were
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Henry Hastings almost kicked Daryl Dawson’s
ass. He would’re too if–</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Little Henry the negroid?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Everyday there’s something over there,
man.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why do you think we fuckin’ quit?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Daryl Dawson’s a pussy faggot.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s ZOG again?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Zionist somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Zionist-Occupational-Government.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s gonna be fine.</p>

<p><strong>derek</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Are you feeling better at all?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I need a kiss.</p>

<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m still trying to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Come in here and I’ll show you, maggot.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fuck off. When’d you start carryin’?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m dropping the kids off at the pool, junior.
Shut the fuckin’ door!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jesus! Chew your food, dude!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: All right. Thanks. I’ll take care of it.
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Okay. Okay. I’m what? What channel?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What is it, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You got pigs outside.</p>
<p><strong>tv ancror</strong>: Saturday’s prison release of a former
skinhead gang leader has many community leaders up in arms tonight.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Drop the t.v., nigger.</p>
<p><strong>tight on the television. a well-dressed black woman</strong>:
speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story. Random black
protestors nod and comment in the background.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: Maybe now whites will understand the
motives behind people like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers. Just put
the shoe on the other foot.</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: Derek Vinyard deserved the death
penalty for what he did to that young man! And now he walks the street
as free as you and I.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about OJ, bitch!?</p>
<p><strong>black woman</strong>: They’ve done it to us again.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Nigger lovin’ Jew media calling the shots.
Watch cartoons. It’s the only t.v. that’s safe nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: No one’s safe–until we all are.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Come in here, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where the fuck you find that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Goin’ to Cam’s party tonight?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Is Davina’s ass water tight?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Hurry up and leave, Goodyear. You’ve taken
your dump now go.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Listen to you. You callin’ me a blimp, you
fuckin’ Democrat?!</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Yes! I am!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m there tonight.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh yeah? You ask Derek?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Noo…but he’s got two kegs.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well…you can think of me drinkin’ ‘em then
when you’re studying with fuckin’… White Trash in there.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where is the fucker, by the way!? He’s hiding

<p><strong>davina</strong>: You’re not even human.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Is Cam playing sticks?</p>

luckbrain or I’ll pistol-whip you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: About Adolf?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: About anything. What do you believe in?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I believe in filth and destruction and chaos
and death and greed.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I believe in my family.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: “Respect your father and your mother. Whoever
curses your mother and father… is to be put to death.” Matthew 15-4.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Good. What else? Tell me what I want to hear,
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You mean that stuff about your mother?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You wanna get beaten?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Then tell me about Adolf and Mein.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Hey Seth? Cut the shit.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m not fuckin’ talkin’ to you, Davina, shut
up! Do you believe in Adolf?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, man. I believe in Adolf.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What do you hate, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I hate everyone that isn’t white
Protestant.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why? And say it with some fucking
conviction!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because they’re a burden to the advancement
of the white race. Some of them are all right–</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: None of them are all right, Danny. They’re all
a bunch of fucking freeloaders. Remermber Canuneron. “We don’t know
them, we don’t want to know them, they’re the fucking enemy.” What don’t
you like about them?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t know. I feel threatened by them.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: They feel threatened by you!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What else, Danny? And speak intelligently you
little queer faggot.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I hate the fact that it’s cool to be black
these days.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I hate this hip hop influence on white
fuckin’ suburbia.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I hate Hilary Clinton and all of her Zionist
MTV pigs telling us we should get along. Save the rhetorical bullshit
honey, it ain’t gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s the best shit I’ve ever heard come out
of that mouth.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: I feel.sorry for you, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shut up, Davina.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: You shut up, you poison to fuckin’ society!
Get out of our house!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Is this any way to treat a guest?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Derek hates you, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How do you know who I hate, Davina?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hey! How are you, man? Fuckin’ A. Long time no
see. Look at that hair.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Gimme just one second, okay?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What’s it to me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I mean…how’d you find out?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: None of your fucking business how I found
out.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I thought it was a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That figures. You’re more stupid than he
is.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s nice to see you too, man.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Why’d you do it, Dan? Because of Seth.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Cammeron?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I did it cause I felt like it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Oh, you do everything you feel like? I feel
like smacking you in the fucking head. Would you mind if I did a report
on that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Uhhh…yeah.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Get a clue, you dumbshit. Hey! Look at me!
Don’t be a dickhead. Sweeney cares about you.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sweeney does? Since when?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Was that him on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yep. So wise up. You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sweeney’s a fuckin’ nigger on a power trip,
Vinyard. That’s what he was like when we were there and that’s how he is
now. It’ll never change either. A nigger is a nigger.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Just put me out of my mercy.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’ll be okay. You want me to pick you up
any more medicine?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Jesus. I can’t believe I ever let it get this
bad.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: It’s not that uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Are you gonna to live or what, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I need a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: My ass. You smoke two packs a day. That’s why
you’re spittin’ phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Jesus, Mrs. Vinyard. I think a lung just came
up.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I’m high as a kite.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You got any more?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Daniel? I know you got homework.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m goin’ in a second. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hey. I’m gonna re-wipe and we’re out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: You’re a pig.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I don’t like him in this house.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I knew.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: He ’ s a fuckin ’ loser, Nazi scumbag.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yes he is. Open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Whatever, dude. I’m gonna go power that shit
and I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Not at Cammeron’s you won’t see me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on, Der! It’s gonna be fuckin’–</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Forget it, Danny! It ain’t gonna happen for
you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hurry up. I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: What else is new?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’ll see ya.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Okay. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Hey what?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come here for a second!</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: I got shit to do, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just read it.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: “American History X? Take home paper as
assigned by Principal Robert Sweeney?” Why is he giving you homework?
What happened to Murray?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Asshole turned me in.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just read.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: “Describe in detail your opinion of -the
historical event that took place in the early morning of October 4th,
1993.” What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The night Derek wasted those guys.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Sweeney gave you this?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: “Before and after…how has this event helped
or hurt your present perspective concerning life in contemporary
America. Use the standard five paragraph format, blab blab blah–this’ll
be good for you..</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nooo…it’ll be good for you.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Eat me, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on! Dick Nixon’s playin’ at Cammeron’s
tonight. You owe me.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: I’m not doing your homework for you! I gotta
spreadsheet due!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: What’s the matter with you? You wanna be a
fuckin’ loser your whole life?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Asshole Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It was lunacy after he left us. All the time.
Derek believed in Cammeron…he was angry…that combination gave them
bodies. White punks…sick of gettin’ their asses kicked by black and
mexican gangs at school.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: I hope you kill that fucker.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: He might have a gun.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Are you going in or not?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: You know I got the cops on me. If I come
up on one of those cameras I’m a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Somebody needs to drive, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: All right. You can turn it off now. You’re
right on his tail, right?</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: I hate that fucking Korean. I hope you smash
his face in.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Just be ready, okay?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come on. Let’s pull it together. Hey! We’re
not playing fuckin’ games here. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin’ nigger
now? Want some crack?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Pull your fucking stupid head out of your ass
then.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Okay. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: We’re here tonight cause we got immigration
problems spiralling out of control. We got Asians up the ass… taking
over our land with their fucking Yen. Mexicans…flocking into this place
like some giant fucking Pinata was shattered.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t laugh. It’s tragic. On the Statue of
Liberty it says “Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor, your
huddled masses…yearning to be free.” It does not say give me your
shiftless, your greedy, your indolent, your criminals, looking for a
free ticket.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: We’re here tonight to show the government how
we feel about minorities taking over our country. The treat us like
criminals while they reward them with jobs and fucking welfare checks.
And it’s only getting worse.</p>
<p><strong>et al</strong>: Fuck yeah it is.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Are you ready to do something about it?</p>
<p><strong>et al</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Remember. No names. Danny? Stay right on my
fucking ass, man.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Wheto’s your fucking green card, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Can’t hide from me, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>from out of nowhere, derek takes a mop to the
owner’s</strong>: HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek
like he’s Superman.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Let’s go! We’re outta here! Move !</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And before Derek could even blink…he had a
crazed army behind him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Willing to follow his word like it was the
word of God.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And then came October 4th, 1993.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Things were fine on the homefront. My Mom had
a good job but a below average boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom house
that Dad left us with. Everyone was happy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Everyone but Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Fuck you, Murray. White men don’t cruise the
streets of LA killing each other.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: No. You guys make bombs.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re so fucking lame. A couple of cranks in
cabins in Montana is not statistically significant. White Americans
don’t take PCP and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin’ miles an
hour! We pull over and trust the law.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Don’t you know, Murray? White people never
break the law. We’re perfect little angels.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s not what I said, Davina. Three
different times Rodney King comes at those officers with the intent to
hurt them. To hurt them! Three times! But since we see it on some
fucking tampered videotape…the bleeding heart media makes you believe
that he only comes at them once. All we see is Powell, Koon and Wind
hittin’ him and– Briseno kickin’ him in the back of the fuckin’ skull
with his boot. Still, the dumbfuck’s tryin’ to get up and kick their
asses! That’s how stupid that motherfucker is. Those cops used
textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were still here he’d say the same damn
thing.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: That doesn’t make it right.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Yes it does. Yes it does. They’re cops! They
are taught to use that stick and they did.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Excessively.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No. Appropriately. Appropriately! Cops have
been granted a certain amount of authority by society and white people,
unfortunately, are the only ones who acknowledge it. I acknowledge a
cop’s authority.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Look who’s talking about respecting the law?
Mr. K.K.K. here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That’s two errors in one sentence, Davina, so
take a fucking course in semantics. First error–I didn’t say I respect
the law. I said I respect a cop’s authority. Second error…I’m not a
member of the fuckin’ low rent, disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan..
Pull your head outta your ass and look at who you’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Don’t speak to her that way, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Murray, stay out of it. You’re not a member
of this family and you never will be.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: What the hell does that have to do with
anything?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You know…sometimes it’s hard to believe I
gave birth to you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Give thanks to the food on the table and then
believe it, Doris.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: We both put food on this table, fella.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: True enough. The point is…if Dan was walking
across the street that night and Rodney King plowed into him–</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Can we forget about Rodney King for
chrissake?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: –while hopped up on Chivas and P.C.P…you’d
consider the force those cops used to be justified!</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: He didn’t hit anybody!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: If he did though! If that shithead killed
Dan…you would have believed the beating to be justified and so would
everybody else. But since he didn’t hit anyone…it’s “Hands Across
America” for the son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: We are still so hung up in this notion that
we have an obligation to help the struggling black man and all you
contribute to it! Lincoln freed the slaves a hundred and thirty years
ago! Get off your fucking asses!</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: I’m with you, honey. All the way. It’s
one…giant…ploy.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: I mean…nobody likes Chief whatever his name
is, right?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Gates.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Yeah. So here comes this filthy piece of
garbage in his Hyundai. He pulls over in front of a perfectly lighted
area where a video camera is sitting there…fucking waiting for him, man.
What happens next? Chief Gates is dust. It’s total–</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: May I be excused please?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t interrupt, Davina.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: I didn’t interrupt shit.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: The hell you didn’t. I was listening to
Stacey and then I heard you. That’s called interrupting. Wait ’til she’s
finished and you can be excused.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Who the hell do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You don’t know when to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Dammit Derek!</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: What are you trying to prove, man?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m trying to teach my sister some respect,
Murray.</p>
<p><strong>davi na</strong>: Let go of my fucking hair!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: See! See the way she speaks! Tell me you’re
gonna shut up and I’ll let go.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Derek! Let go of her hair and sit down!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I will when I hear an answer, Doris. Are you
going to shut up, Davina?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What are you thinkin’?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Danny?! Are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s a real easy question, Davina. A simple
yes or no will suffice. Tell me what I want to hear and I’ll let go.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Fuck…you.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: She can’t breathe, Derek!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Stay back, both of you! It’s her bed, she’s
gotta lie in it. You can cry all you want, Davina. I’m not gonna let go
until you tell me what I wanna hear! Are you going to shut that fat
fucking mouth of your’s and let my girlfriend tell her opinion? Are
you?!</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Let go of her hair and get out.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: I hate you, you fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Psycho.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Would you care to repeat that, Murray? I’m
not sure I got all of it.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: He called you a “psycho”, honey.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Was that it? Thanks Murray.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: See. Here we go again with this, Derek.
Making me out to be the bad guy again.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: You callin’ me a liar, RosenKike?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Hey goddammit! You talk to me with respect
or–!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Or what, Murray!? What’re you gonna do? Give
her fucking detention?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Both of you get out right now.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Do you think you’re the only one who’s
affected around here?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Out of respect for my mother…I’m gonna let
that comment go, Murray. I won’t bash your face in. But let me tell you
somethin’…man to fuckin’ mouse here. Normally in a situation like this
I’d take my steel-tips to your fucking Jewish temple. That goes for
anyone making comments about me, my family, Stacey, whomever. You know
and I know that I could crush that puny fuckin’ skull of yours in a
second. So it’s beyond me why you would say something like that without
being able to back it up? What’s worse, you sack of shit, is you calling
the woman I love a liar.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I never said she was a liar.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Weasel like that again Murray…you fuckin’
ponytail, pussy, bagel eating, teacher, faggot…and I’ll cut your shylock
nose off. Make no mistake.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Murray Rosenberg…International Jew.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: He’s a stupid kid, Murray! I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: He’s not a kid, Doris. We were kids. We
didn’t call people kikes.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: It’s just gonna take some time with him. What
can I do?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: You don’t know your children, Doris! You
have no clue about the world they live in. Your son is a terrorist.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: He’s not a terrorist, Murray. Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: He’s a member of the Disciples of Christ.
You remember that grocery store incident?!</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: My sister and her two kids got evacuated
from her Temple in Woodland Hills!</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Murray! Please! Derek would never have
anything to do with bombs, okay?! You don’t know him like I do.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: And I wouldn’t want to. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Take this, you fucking dick!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Davina! It’s okay! Calm down. Please.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Fuck you! Let go!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m sorry, Davina. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Let go of me!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come on, Davina. I’m sorry. I lost control.
Please. I screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You guys are my life and I’d do anything for
you. You do know that?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: I don’t believe you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I swear to God I would, Davina. Please.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I believe you, Der.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Davina? Please forgive me. Please. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: That fuckin’ sucked, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I know it did. And I’m sorry. I just really
hate that guy.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: You couldn’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Find an apartment because I want you out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Morn, I’m sorry but that guy’s–</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I don’t wanna hear it anymore! I want you
out!</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: He can move in with me.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Thank you, honey.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Hey. Come here. Sit with me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve got this thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You can sit down for two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t breathe on me.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s cold in here, no wonder your sick.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: What? I’m not allowed to look at you
anymore?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No. You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you ever gonna
let that beautiful hair grow back?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nope. Never.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I bet you will.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: If you need me to proof anything for you I
will.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Wake up early if you get tired.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Get on the floor, Danny! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You fucked with the wrong bull.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Goddamn, man!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Let the cops handle it, Der!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Fuck that. The cops will let him walk.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck? Open your
mouth and put it on the corner of the curb. I’m gonna teach you a little
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Derek!?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Get in the fucking house, Dan!</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Come on, man. Call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: My dad gave me that truck, motherfucker.
Couldn’t leave well enough alone. Put your mouth on the corner of the
fucking curb!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The cops are comin’ Der’</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What the fuck did you say? You just threaten
me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Holy fucking shit! Derek! What the hell was
that for?! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Joseph Conrad once wrote that “murder is
always with us. It’s almost an institution.” That couldn’t rang more
true than with me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Bobby Lawrence died of massive head trauma
early that morning.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Six months after that…Derek was convicted and
sentenced to seven years for voluntary manslaughter…to be served at the
California State Penitentiary in Chino.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Prosecutors wanted murder one for my
brother’s torture method…but there wasn’t enough “premeditated”
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Over the next year we’d lose our house and
the rest of our father’s pension to attorney fees. My mother…much to all
of our surprise…stood by Derek.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’re here, dude.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Drop your dick and grab your stick.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I told you I can’t tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s okay, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If I don’t finish this thing I’m dead.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Just tell ’em you’ll do it tomorrow. You
can’t miss the party.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to grab
your ass.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: She did?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You gotta hit that shit. It’s the only fun
thing that’s legal anymore.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Dan?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Dr. Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Nothing here. Is everything all right over
there?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: How’s it comin’?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m doing it right now.</p>
<p><strong>cmris</strong>: Who is it, dude?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who?! Why is he calling here!? Fuck you,
Sweeney! Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Get a fucking job, you reggie!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You fuckers are going to get me booted!
Dr. Sweeney? I’m sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Just make sure it’s on my desk tomorrow,
Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’ll be there, alright!?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: It better be.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re an idiot if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m not asking you.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What if he writes something stupid and that
nigger turns you in? Jesus. He didn’t testify, Der. They can use that
shit and re-try you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Sweeney’s not gonna do anything, Seth. He
helped get me released.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m out, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m only going to tell you this once so pay
attention. I’m done, Seth. I don’t want you to come near me…near Dan…I
want you to leave my family alone.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re serious.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m dead fucking serious. No more phone
calls, no more visits, no more nothing.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: We don’t exist as far as you’re concerned,
Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I can’t believe I’m hearing this shit come out
of your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Believe it, Seth. Believe it. I spent over
three years away from my family. My family, Seth. For what?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: For your country, fuckhole, that’s what. I’d
do a hundred years before I felt like that.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re a motherfucking traitor!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What the–? Shit.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: You’re full of shit!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: If he ain’t here, he’s comin’.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yo! What’s up, Fat Seth!?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m not fat, cockwart! I’m husky!</p>
<p><strong>cmris</strong>: Okay! I’m sorry, bro!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Take it easy, dude!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’re you doin’?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Your brother’s a piece of shit!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Holy shit. Father Vinyard!?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m Jason and that’s Chris! We’re friends
with your brother!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re a fuckin’ god, man!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Do me a favor. Grab Danny and get outta
here!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We just got here, man!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You what!?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You don’t have any homework?!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: School doesn’t exist anymore, Father.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I wrote you. Two letters while you were in
there! Did you get them?!</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Excuse fuckin’ me!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Cassandra.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Oh my God! They said you might be here
but I didn’t fucking believe ’em!</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: I hope what I heard ain’t true, man. You
better hightail it the fuck outta here if it is.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: You gotta chop that mop, Der!</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Stacey’s meandering around here
somewhere! Have you seen the bitch?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: The only person I’ve seen is Seth.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Oh God. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Are you going in there?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Can you tell Danny that Lizzy’s looking for
him?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: He won’t do anything’drastic I hope.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I gotta do that paper though.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I thought you already turned that fucker
in?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My teacher cried to Sweeney, man. have to do
another one.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Oh man. Fucking Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Meanwhile, niggers and spics do their
reports on Malcolm X and fucking Fidel Castro.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Sweeney’s got an agenda, Danny. And it’s
all a load of crap. You hear me? He’s all about brainwashing. Don’t get
fucking fooled by it.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What the hell are you doing here, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Hey. I was wondering when he was going to
show his face.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What did I tell you, Dan?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I had to check it out, Der. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: He’ll be all right, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: There’s a redhead out there looking for you.
Go talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: You go with.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: You made it, man. When I heard they threw
you in General Population I thought it was curtains.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It wasn’t too bad.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: So what’s all this self-righteous,
born-again shit I’m hearing then?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Have a seat, Derek. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: How was it in there with all those fuckin’
monkeys, man? You’re lucky they didn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Who runs the place? The monkeys or the
wetbacks?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: The Mexicans.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: It’s a fuckin’ vacation for them in there,
hunh?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: They were really organized. I’ll tell ya…it
was impressive. They–</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: I like you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I like you, too.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: They’re fuckin’ peasants, Derek. All of
them. So what’s up, man? I’m hearing a lot of shit about you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Be careful with me, Cam. You don’t know
what’s going on with me.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Fuckin’ talk to me then. We’re family
here. Let’s work it out whatever it is.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m family, Cam? Is that why you came to see
me all the time up there?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I had to distance myself from you after
that.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Fuck you, Cameron. You’re a fucking chicken
hawk…praying on kids.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I don’t pray on fucking anyone.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: No. You fucking use them. To filter your
insanity.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: You and Danny are like brothers to me,
Derek. Come on, man.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: He’s not your brother, Cameron. All right?
He’s my brother. You hear me, Cam?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Fuck you, Derek! Fuck you! Don’t think you
can threaten me with this shit for a fuckin’ second! I’m more important
to him now then you ever were.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You gonna listen?!</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I’m gonna fuckin’ kill you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Shut the fuck up! You’re gonna stay away!
That’s what you’re gonna do!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>random skin</strong>: Hey Derek!?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Jesus, Der. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Where’s Cammeron, man?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I haven’t seen him.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Don’t point your fucking finger at me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m serious, Stacey! Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: What are you gonna do?! Hunh?! Hit me?! Kick
me as I roll on the fuckin’ ground screaming?! That bullshit with
Cammeron is nothing, Derek!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Goddamn you, Derek! Those two niggers
deserved what they got. They deserved to die! And just like Cameron and
Seth and a million others out there…I’ll believe that ’til the day I
fucking die. I will. Nothing will ever change that either.</p>
<p><strong>et al</strong>: Forty-five! Forty-six! Forty- seven…!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why the fuck did you pump it?! I coulda gone
for a minute at least!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Let him go, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where’s Cameron?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Seth, man!? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’d be doing America a great fucking favor,
let me tell you.</p>
<p><strong>stacey</strong>: Do it, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: You got fuckin’ guests out there,
Cam.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come with me right now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What the luck are you thinking!?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What are you thinking!? Friends don’t fight
friends, Der! They stick together!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: They’re not friends, Dan!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What the hell are they then?!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Just sit there and relax for a second.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t wanna relax! You looked like an idiot
back there!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s happened to you, Derek?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You got lucky, man. I was in the kitchen
for a year before making it in here. Pots and motherfucking pans…
disgusting beef stroganoff shit… boiling hot water…fuck that! My name’s
Lamont, man.</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: I got your back. Righteous white Cracker
with attitude. Just like the Judge who sentenced me, man.</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: If your smart though you’ll remember one
thing. You’re the nigger in here. Not me.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I was just talking about you. You’re
Cammeron’s boy?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: His boy? No, I don’t think so, man. I’m not
anybody’s boy.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Well…you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Nooo, I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Here, man. Relax and have a hit.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Nooo…how about you getting that fucking shit
awax from me?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: You got a problem, man?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Excuse me? Do I have a problem? No, I don’t
have a problem. Do you have a problem?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: No. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>int. prison laundry room - early morning</strong>: Lamont in
mid-conversation.</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: But I won’t go down on that shit. No way, no
how. You ever been with a soul sister?</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Oh shit! Sorry, man! Forgot who the luck I
was talking to there for a second. Let me ask you this one though cause
I don’t know the white man’s take. You like eating pussy?</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Oh man! You sick fucking bastard! You sick
pig!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: And you don’t!? Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Man…you don’t know shit about the brothers.
We won’t go down on that shit if the bitch was holding a gun to our
fucking head.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: How’s your face, man?</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: That’ll teach you. Don’t be a prick to your
superiors.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m right here, man. You wanna have it out
with me, let’s go. Just me and you though.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Man…you are a stupid motherfucker. You know
that? When are you–?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Stupid?! You have anything else to say, you
little pussy! Hunh?!</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>huge aryan</strong>: Well well well. A virgin.</p>
<p><strong>huge aryan</strong>: You ain’t so tough now, are you?</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Motherfucker. What now, man?</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Shit, holmes. Hang on to me, man. You’re
heavy.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, you do have some tearing down here.
Christ. Okay. I’m gonna have to stitch you up so I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Honor and loyalty run thick, Derek. Not
skin color. Skin is thin. I don’t get you, man. I don’t. I got my
Doctorate in Education…not in medicine. But if you think babies come
into this world evil…you’re fucked up, Derek. You’re way to smart to
believe that shit. There’s nothin’ more beautiful Derek, nothin’ more
pure, nothin’ more innocent…than a baby.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: They killed my father, Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Jesus Derek. Use that brain God gave you
for chrissake. What are you gonna do? Seek revenge your whole life and
become a lifer in here. That’s what these guys are like, you wanna be
like them? Fucking little boys in prison? Think, man. None of your guys
back home give a shit about you. They only care about your brother. The
new blood. And he sure as hell can’t take care of himself like you
could.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Get me outta here, Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How you doin’, man?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: All right. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: I’m fucking incarcerated, man. With a bunch
of faggots. How you think I’m doin’?</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: What are you gonna do, man?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’m not going to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Dr. Sweeney called me. He spoke with a guy on
the parole board here. He thinks you might be getting out soon.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How are the others?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Davina’s good. UCLA Math major. All three of
you have always been so great in school. I wonder why all this–</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What about Dan, Mom? How’s he?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: He’s doing the same stuff you were doing,
Derek. Hanging out with Cammeron, getting into trouble. It brings back a
lot of sad memories. And I can’t do anything…he won’t listen to me. He
needs you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re my best friend, Danny. You’re my only
friend. And I just want what’s best for you.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: How the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Pretty shitty assignment you got.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Out of respect for your father.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Oh yeah? What the hell do you know- about my
father?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hey. Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Time for bed.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Goodnight, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There was only one person who loved Derek
more than me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That was Dad. They were best friendS. Fathers
and sons are never best friends…but they were..</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Breakfast!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Okay! Let’s go, Davina! Derek!</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: So what’s this all about, Dennis?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: What about this gang stuff?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Jesus Doris…it’s not that big of a deal. All
departments have to take a precaution class on gang patrol today.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: A guy was shot yesterday in
Inglewood…changin’ a valve on a hydrant. LAPD is worried that more
firefighters will become targets. That’s what this bullshit is about. A
good father this guy was though and now he’s in intensive care because
of some goddamn–! They’ve pretty much declared war on LAPD and us.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Why you guys though? I can see them but the
fire department?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: They think we would rather let a building
burn down over there than fight it. So now we got two fights goin’ on at
one goddamn time.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Dayins! Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: I’m coming right now! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’ll tell you one more thing. This
“affirmative blaction” shit is driving me up the fucking wall.
Firefighters gettin’ 99’s on their tests while rappers who score a
goddamn 62 walk away with the job.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t we have to have “affirmative
action?”</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Not when a job requires ability. No.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: A lot of people say otherwise, Danny.
Including me.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: A lot of people don’t know shit, either.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: If I’m fightin’ a brush fire… surrounded by
thousand degree flames…who would I want watchin’ my back? A guy who
scores a 99 or a guy who scores a sixty? You don’t see half the NBA with
whites, gooks and spics.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Nooo…what you don’t see are minorities on the
boards of Fortune 500 companies cause whites won’t stand for it.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Doris! I’m tired of your damn argument! You
sound like an idiot!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Sweeney actually had a pretty good take on
affirmative action the other day.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Really? I didn’t know you spoke “African”,
Derek? Where’d you learn that shit? Johannesberg?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Honey? Please don’t speak that way. They
don’t–</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: How am I speaking, Doris!? Hunh?! I’m
speakin’ fineP Hey. Don’t let that him confuse you over there, Derek.
Look at me. This shit he’s pulling is a load of crap. Hey. Look at me,
Derek. I mean it. If we keep givin’ niggers everything, there’ll be
nothing left for us.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You can be a stupid son of a bitch
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: And then we have naive fools like her.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I really hate you with a passion some
times.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You know what I mean though, right?</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well…good morning, Miss Monroe! Look at you.
You look like a star.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I like that color, Davina.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Thanks</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You did like it.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Come on, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Yeah. Well you’re lucky I’m letting you wear
that crap on your eyes. I love you but you’re too young.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: That sucks, man.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: It totally sucks. And we all sympathize with
you, too.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You got practice today?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Coach’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You wanna go to Der’s game with me?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Santa Monica High tonight, right?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Perfect. Ben’ll whip us up a couple of
double deckers and we’ll head over.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: Spare change for a cheeseburger?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Get a job and buy one why don’t you.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: Fifty cents is all I ask. Vietnam,
man.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Really? So you’ve had what? Thirty years
to get your shit together?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: All I want is something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: There are plenty of fuckin’ dishwashing
jobs out there, Vietnam boy. Go get yourself one.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: Did I do something?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: You’re a disgrace to the white race. If
Adolf Hitler was alive…God bless his soul…he would have you shot.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: Fuck you then. Now and forever. Fuck
you.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Noooo. Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I think I need to go to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I don’t know. I think so.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where’s Stacey?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Who gives a fuck?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Derek’s a fuckin’ traitor pussy.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Well…we might be pussies too if we got
treated the way he did.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Stevie McCormick called…old school Venice
bro. He’s at Chino…doin’ life. He hated Derek. Said he was a fucking
blow-up doll in there.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fucking A.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Is there anything sacred in this country
anymore? Jesus Christ. Hey. Stop feeding your face for a second and look
behind you.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Can we help you with something? Do you
have any questions about the menu?</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: No questions.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I recommend either the “Big Ben Burger” or
the “Chicken Taco Special.” Ben’ll replace the dark meat with the white
meat if you ask nicely.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: What’s your problem, pal?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I ain’t your fucking pal first of all.
Secondly…I don’t have problems. People who luck with me have
problems.</p>
<p><strong>white girl</strong>: Come on. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Hey! What a great idea! You got a clever
little whatever it is there. I’d listen to it if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: You’re not me.</p>
<p><strong>camheron</strong>: And I thank God Almighty every day for
that, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Excuse me? Tyrone?</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: My name’s not Tyrone either.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Whatever. Why can’t you stick to your own
race?</p>
<p><strong>white girl</strong>: Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes come
from?!</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: What the luck difference does it make
where we come from, bitch? I’m from a place called America. A place that
used to be a nice place to live before it became fuckin’
Africa-America.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: You ignorant mother–</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You got a fuckin’ death wish, asshole? Do you?
Make your move now if you do. If you don’t…get the luck out of my sight.
Cause I’m real close to shoving my piece up your girlfriend’s stinky
pussy.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Everything’s hunky dory, Ben! No problemo.
Only us white folk.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Did you “save” it?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: It wouldn’t irritate me so much if the
ratio was a little more even.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost all of
those orange kid relationships are black man and white women and I’m
fucking sick of seein’ it! I wouldn’t mind so much if it were more
even.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Huge dicks, Cam. That’s all it is.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: I used to think that too but…it’s gotta be
more, man. It has to be more than the fact they they carry a big load.
Chicks aren’t that shallow, are they? It’s politically correct… that’s
what it is. White women…bein’ seen with the coloreds…it’s great for
their image. Bitches today want to be known as bein’ fuckin’ color
blind.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: They get off on it.</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: And you can’t really blame Tyrone.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why the fuck not?</p>
<p><strong>cammeron</strong>: Well…how’d you like to drag around some
fat fly girl? I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No shit. Oh go girlfriend! Don’t be puttin’ up
wid dat, girl! Oh stop girl!</p>
<p><strong>little henry</strong>: You gonna waste ’em?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Only if we have to.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m printing it up and we’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Wow. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I gotta see my parole officer.</p>
<p><strong>davina</strong>: Hey Der? Do you have Excel on disk?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’ve got everything on disk.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You look good.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: We’re getting out of here soon. Is that okay
with you?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I’d love it. Do you think I should color my
hair?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: I’m glad you made it back. I wasn’t too sure
I was going to see you again. You know how I get.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You think you’ll be able to forgive me?
Someday maybe?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You’re my son. Of course I will.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Look at me. I’m such a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Maple bar and a…large milk.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You look pretty.</p>
<p><strong>tisha</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>black girl</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How old are you, Tisha?</p>
<p><strong>black mother</strong>: Come here, Tisha.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: We need to talk, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How’d you find out I was here?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: We were just at your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: Cammeron and Seth are in the ICU at
St. Johns, Derek. They were jumped in front of Ben’s Burgets early this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How bad?</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: They’ll live. They must have been looking
for somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Are they coming after you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: I don’t know. You might have to talk to
your old crew though.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I can’t, Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Try, Derek. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Okay? Before it explodes.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: And watch your back.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: You showing up today?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hey. Keep your head up, alright? I’m going to
take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know. I’ll figure it out though. You
gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I gotta turn that paper in.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I’ll see you at home.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: You need a lift anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jesus Christ. What are you doing, Henry?</p>
<p><strong>little henry</strong>: What does it look like I’m doin’?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on, man, no. You don’t want to do this.
Come on. Henry?</p>
<p><strong>little henry</strong>: Danny?</p>
<p><strong>little henry</strong>: Vinyard? Danny?</p>
<p><strong>rasmussen</strong>: He won’t let go. Will you talk to
him?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Derek? You gotta let him go, man. They
gotta get him outta here.</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Derek! I know what you’re thinkin’ right
now and I want you to forget about it!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: How the luck do you know what I’m thinkin’,
Sweeney!?</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: Cause I’m thinkin’ the same damn thing!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: They shot him in a fucking…pisshole!</p>
<p><strong>sweeney</strong>: And goin’ after them won’t bring him back.
Don’t do it, Derek. Please, man. You’ve come too far. The war is
over.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It stops now, Sweeney.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: We’ve heard it a million times, a Bible quote
become cliche: “Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.”</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Vengeance brought about by hate…and fear.
When it points its head in our direction, we take notice and everything
changes. The way we choose our friends, the way we protect our families,
the way we create enemies out of strangers. Welcome to America.</p>
