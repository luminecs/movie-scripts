<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Dick Laurent is dead.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: You don’t mind that I’m not coming
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I thought I’d stay home and read.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Read?… Read what, Renee?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s nice to know I can still make you
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I like to laugh, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s why I married you.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Wake me up when you get home.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: A videotape.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Who’s it from?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I don’t know… There’s no return address on
the envelope… In fact, there’s no address on it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Does it say anything on the tape?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, let’s see what’s on it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It must be from a real estate agent.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Good book, huh?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Huh?… oh, yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Same one you were reading the other night?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What night?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: When you didn’t come to the club.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different
one.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I called, you know.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Called? When?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: From the club. You didn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when
you got home, wasn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You were asleep when I got home, yes.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I told you you could wake me up if you wanted
to.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I had a dream about you last night…</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You were in the house… calling my name… but I
couldn’t find you.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Fred? Fred, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>fred v.0.</strong>: Then there you were… lying in bed… but it
wasn’t you… It looked like you… but it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Fred, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You’re up early.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: That dog woke me. I lay there for a while,
then decided to get up.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Who the hell owns that dog?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’s that? Another tape?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yes, I just found it on the step.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Don’t you want to watch it?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, do you wanna watch it?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: We’ve got to call the police.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: …yes, I’ve been on hold for ten minutes… I
can’t… All right, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Hello, yes… Good… My name is Renee Madison…
My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician… we live at 442 Hollis
Street… Right… 442 Hollis… near the observatory… Someone’s been in the
house… at night… while we were sleeping… I know because they sent,
dropped off a videotape… two videotapes… to show us… That’s right… Yes…
it… the second one… shows us asleep… Someone broke in and taped us while
we slept!… Isn’t that enough?… Okay, sure… We will… 442 Hollis… Yes,
we’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Two detectives are coming out.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Let’s have a look at the hallway outside the
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Very strange.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: How’d the camera get so high like that?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: And smooth… Almost no movement - back and forth,
I mean.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Like you’d get if it was hand held.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Right … This just glided along.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: This is the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Do you always sleep here?… In this room?… Both
of you?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: This is our bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: There’s no other bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No… There is, I mean, I use it as a practice
room… it’s soundproofed.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You’re a musician?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yes, I thought my wife …</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: What’s your axe?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Tenor… Tenor saxophone. Do you…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Tone deaf.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Do you own a video camera?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: No. Fred hates them.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I like to remember things my own way.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How I remember them. Not necessarily the way
they happened.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Do you have an alarm system?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Yes, actually we do… but we haven’t been
using it.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It kept going off for some reason. False
alarms.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Might be a good time to try using it again.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Anybody else have a key to the house.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Maid? Relative?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: No, one of us is always here to let the maid
in. Nobody else has a key.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Let’s check the doors and windows… See if
there’s been a break-in.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: As best we can.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: If anything else happens, you’ll call us. Al
hands Fred a card. Ed hands Renee a card.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: We will.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Thanks, guys.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: It’s what we do.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What the hell is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I wish I knew.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: What was that?!!!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: On the tape! There was something else on the
tape.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: There! Play it!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: You don’t remember being awakened? It looks like
you were aware of someone.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Or something.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, I don’t remember anything. it looks like
I… but… I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Why would anyone do something like this?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Has anyone made any threats to either of you
recently?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Or not so recently?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, not to me.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I… no. No. No threats.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We’ll take the tapes with us, if that’s all
right with you?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: We’ll see that the patrol of the house is
doubled.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I don’t know if I want to stay here. I don’t
feel safe.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Where would you feel safe?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I don’t know. maybe a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Did you use the alarm system since we were here
last?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: The first night … Not the last two.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting
paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house
while we’re sleeping, filming us, and you don’t want to act paranoid?!!!
I thought you set the alarm!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ll make sure the alarm is set from now
on.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: But that doesn’t solve the problem. Who is
doing this? And why?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: We’ll find out, Mrs. Madison.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: We’ve met before, haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I don’t think so. Where was it that you think
we’ve met?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: At your house. Don’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, no I don’t. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Of course. In fact, I’m there right
now.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What do you mean? You’re where right now?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: At your house.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s absurd.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p>****: Dial your number.</p>
<p>****: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: I told you I was here.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Ask me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How did you get into my house?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: You invited me. It’s not my habit to go
where I’m not wanted.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Give me my phone back.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: It’s been a pleasure talking to
you.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I thought you were getting me a drink?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Andy, who is that guy?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t know his name. He’s a friend of Dick
Laurent’s, I think.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dick Laurent?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes, I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But Dick Laurent is dead, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He is? I didn’t think you knew Dick. How do
you know he’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I don’t. I don’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dick can’t be dead. Who told you he was
dead?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Honey, who?… Who’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Now! We’re leaving now! I didn’t want to come
here in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: How’d you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It was a long time ago… I met him at this
place called Moke’s… We… became friends… He told me about a job…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What job?</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: I don’t remember… Anyway, Andy’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: He’s got some fucked up friends.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Stay in the car!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I told you to stay in the car!</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out
here?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I thought there might be somebody inside.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Was there?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No… of course not.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: It’s so odd… Waiting out there, I had the
strangest feeling… Like this had happened before. I mean, your telling
me to stay outside while you went in like that.</p>
<p><strong>renee</strong>: Fred? Fred, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>int. the madison house - hallway - night</strong>: Renee’s
POV - down the hallway. There is just darkness at the end of the hall.
It is EERIE. After a moment, Fred slowly walks out of the darkness
toward Renee. He walks out of the shot and the camera remains on the
rectangle of darkness at the end of the hall.</p>
<p><strong>int. the madison house - living room - day</strong>:
Footsteps can be heard on the stairs. Fred’s head appears at the top of
the stairway. He comes up into the living room carrying a manila
envelope, like the ones previously received. His expression is strained.
He is alone. Fred pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it
in the VCR, turns it on. He sits on the couch and watches. We go from a
WIDE SHOT to a FULL FRAME SHOT of the video.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Renee!</p>
<p><strong>int. police station - interrogation room - night</strong>:
Fred’s POV: A BIG FIST slams into Fred’s face, knocking him back in a
chair. Ed and Al are standing in front of Fred.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Stay put, killer!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I didn’t kill her! Tell me I didn’t kill
her!</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Hi, doc. Workin’ late tonight, huh?</p>
<p><strong>m.e.</strong>: Party at the mayor’s house, George. This is
his daughter, Joyce.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Howdy, Joyce.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Howdy, George.</p>
<p><strong>m.e.</strong>: Just like Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I don’t know if I can watch this.</p>
<p><strong>m.e.</strong>: Leave any time you want, lover. I won’t take
it personally.</p>
<p><strong>m.e.</strong>: Easy, girl, easy.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: You talking to me or… her?</p>
<p><strong>m.e.</strong>: A corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Have you reached a verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Yes, we have, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please hand it to the bailiff.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: And what is your verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We the jury find the defendant guilty of
murder in the first degree.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Fred Madison, the jury having found you
guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to
be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: Did you see that about the guy who chopped
up his wife into a million pieces?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: How could I miss it? The TV won’t quit with
that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: They’re gonna cook him.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Andy’s from Utah. He says there you have a
choice… You can die by hanging or by firing squad.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: Which would you choose?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Andy would go for this, don’t you think?…
Firing squad, definitely.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: Do they aim for the head or for the
heart?</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: The heart, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: I wouldn’t… The brain would know what’s
going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood
pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Oh, that’s hot… So you’d rather be hung,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: Absolutely… Soon as your neck snaps, you
black out. It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn’t
feel it.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: You might be right, Raquel.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Guess who?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Make yourself to home, fella.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: See you soon, Sammy. Don’t think takin’ a
jolt is gonna get you outta payin’ me back the twenty you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #2</strong>: Don’t take it personal, pal.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #3</strong>: Un fuerte abrazo, amigo!</p>
<p><strong>inmate #4</strong>: Hang in there, honey.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #5</strong>: Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #6</strong>: Show ’em you got big stones, bro.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Line check. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Any final words, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: My… My head.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You
want to come in? Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want
it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, no. I want to go in.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s botbering you, Madison?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: The pain is getting worse. I need more
aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I can’t give you anymore. I’ll talk to the
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You sleeping okay?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I can’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’ll sleep now. Take him back to his
cell.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Aspirin… fly head. I gotta have more
aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The doctor said not to give you anything. You
can see him in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But my head…</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Shit, that wife killer’s lookin’ pretty
fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Who are you? What are you doing in this
cell?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah, look,
somethin’ crazy’s happened. No, I mean, Madison ain’t in his cell. No,
there’s somebody in there, but it ain’t Madison! Right, right. Okay…
Captain Henderson’s comin’’?… Right.</p>
<p><strong>johnny mack</strong>: F-u-u-u-ck me!</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Now, Mack, what’s the
situation?</p>
<p><strong>johnny mack</strong>: I’m not entirely certain, Captain.
You’ll have to see for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: That’s not Fred Madison?</p>
<p><strong>johnny mack</strong>: No, sir, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>johnny mack</strong>: I couldn’t say, sir… Captain
Henderson?</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Yeah, Mack?</p>
<p><strong>j0hnny mack</strong>: Captain… this is some spooky shit we
got here.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Repeat that, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Warden, it’s not him. It .was not
Fred Madison in that cell.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Of course, it’s Madison!!! Who else could it
be?</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: I don’t know. The guards say
they’ve never seen him before.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: He’s in the infirmary, being
examined.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Did you ask him who he is?</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: He… He can’t talk. it appears as
if he can’t talk, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: If he’s not Madison, then where’s
Madison?</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: I’ve got men searching the
building and the grounds now.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I want to take a look at this man
myself.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: What is this, Rogoff?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Who is this man?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: He’s just been fingerprinted, and I’ll
run these blood tests right away. We’ll find out soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: He’s not Madison?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: Not even close.</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: I examined Madison last night, Marshall.
He had a headache.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: A headache?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: I did a routine once-over, and gave him
a sleeping pill. I’ve never seen this man before. Neither have the
guards. I don’t think he’s in the system.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Where the hell did you come from,
mister?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger
is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He’s twenty-four years old. His
birthday is April 21st. He was born and raised right here. He lives with
his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue. Pete
Dayton was arrested five</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: How about Madison? Have we had even a hint
of his whereabouts?</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There’s
an APB out on him. His photo’s been faxed nationwide.</p>
<p><strong>prison official #1</strong>: I had a call from the governor’s
office about this.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: How the hell does she know?</p>
<p><strong>prison official #1</strong>: There’s press outside right
now.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: How the hell… 7</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: One of the guards must have
leaked it.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: What’s the word on the street?</p>
<p><strong>prison official #2</strong>: Only that Madison has apparently
escaped. Nothing about the other guy.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Good, let’s keep it that way. Keep a lid on
Dayton. Nothing gets out about him.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I have a statement to read… Fred Madison, an
inmate being held on death row has, apparently… has escaped. An
all-points bulletin has been issued to authorities not only statewide,
but nationwide. We are confindent that he will be apprehended very soon.
No further details are available at this time. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Warden, nobody’s ever escaped from death
row before. How did he get out?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: I’m Warden Clements. This is Captain
Henderson and Dr. Rogoff. Please, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told over
the phone, your son, Peter, is here.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: He… He was discovered this morning… in a
cell on death row.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: A cell that was supposed to be occupied by
an inmate named Fred Madison.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The wife killer?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: How is this possible, Warden?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: …Tell me, what was Peter’s condition the
last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: His condition? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: His physical condition.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Same as always. Pete takes care of
himself.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I saw him before he went to the garage day
before yesterday. He’s a mechanic. Look, is he okay? Can we see him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: He has a hematoma on his forehead and a
condition called blepharitis… that’s redness and swelling around the
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Was he in a fight?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: These conditions don’t indicate a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: But what is the cause then? … And how did he
get in that cell?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: He can’t talk. Or won’t.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That doesn’t sound like Pete.</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: Your son has experienced some sort of
trauma, I’m afraid. We were hoping that the two of you could help
explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: You don’t know Fred Madison?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No… Only what was in the news.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Do you think Pete knows him?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I wouldn’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: You say you haven’t seen your son since the
day before yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: When he went to work, right.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: What about yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He didn’t come home.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sometimes he stays at a friend’s.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Any particular friends?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: A girl’s, a buddy’s. I don’t know. He’s his
own man; he comes and goes as he pleases.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I want to see him.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Yes, and we need to talk to him… if we can.
Mel, let’s get Peter in here.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Pete…</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: Pete, can you tell us now, anything about
this?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Pete, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s okay. Take your time, honey.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Where … am I?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: You’re in the state penitentiary. You
were found in a cell on death row.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: My head hurts.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: A man named Fred Madison was occupying that
cell. He’s missing. we’re trying to find out how it is you were in there
and not him.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: Do you know Fred Madison?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Warden, can we take him home?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rogoff</strong>: From a medical standpoint, I don’t see
why not.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: We need to find out what happened
here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Have you made any charges against him?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Then he’s coming home with his mother and
me.</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: All right… but you see our predicament…
Legally we can’t hold him, but he may be able to help us… perhaps later.
For now, he’s free to leave.</p>
<p><strong>captain henderson</strong>: You just gonna let him go?</p>
<p><strong>warden</strong>: We’ll get a tail put on him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just rest easy, Pete. You’re gonna be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Are you hungry, honey? I’ll fix you
something.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No… I don’t feel so good. I would like some
aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Coming up.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Thanks, Al.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Now we’ll see what this son of a bitch is up
to.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where’s Pete?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Out in back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No… Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How’re you feelin’?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Arnie called this morning while you were
sleepin’. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told ’im you

<p><strong>pete</strong>: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nice to know they can’t seem to get along

<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yeah.</p>

Deep Dell Place… It’s a white stucco job on the south side of the
street… I’ll be upstairs with Andy… The back door will be open… That
leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room -

<p><strong>pete</strong>: Sheila, what is it?… What are you doin’

<p><strong>sheila</strong>: You’ve been fucking somebody else haven’t

<p><strong>pete</strong>: Sheila…</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: You fuck me whenever you want… You don’t

<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sheila… Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I don’t care anyway… I’m sorry, Mr. Dayton…

<p><strong>claire</strong>: Pete… There’s a man on the phone. He’s
called a couple of times tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He won’t give his name.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: Hey, Pete… How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: You know who it is.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Mr. Eddy?</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: Yeah… How ya doin’, Pete?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: You’re doin, okay? That’s good, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Look… It’s late, Mr. Eddy… I …</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: I’m really glad you’re doin’ okay,
Pete.</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: You sure you’re doin’ okay? Everything all
right?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: That’s good, Pete. Hey… I want you to talk
to a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’ve met before, haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I don’t think so. Where was it that you think
we’ve met?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: At your house. Don’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No. No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We just killed a couple of people…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You heard me… We thought we’d come over and
tell you about it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Great question!! In the east … the far east…
when a person is sentenced to death… they’re sent to a place where they
can’t escape… never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them
and fire a bullet into the back of their head… it could be days… weeks…
or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced… This
uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don’t
you think? It’s been a pleasure talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy</strong>: Pete… I just wanted to jump on and tell
you I’m really glad you’re doin’ okay.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You got him.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Alice, I…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Put this in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>pete,</strong>: We killed him.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You killed him.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Alice?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It was an accident… Accidents happen every
day.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Alice…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We gotta get the stuff and get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Is that you? Are both of them you?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Pete?…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Where’s the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Up the stairs - down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>woman/alice</strong>: Did you want to talk to me?</p>
<p>****: Did you want to ask me “why”?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Don’t you trust me, Pete?…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Stick that in your belt.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Look at all this shit… I know a fence… he’ll
give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car… We
can go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Alice?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Come on, baby.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You drive.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We have to go to the desert. He’s at his
cabin.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We’ll have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Why me, Alice? Why choose me?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So we can be together… You still want to be
with me, don’t you Pete?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: More than ever?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I want you… I want you…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’ll never have me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Where’s Alice?</p>
<p><strong>mystery man</strong>: Alice who?</p>

Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent- head over there.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: We’ve got Pete Dayton’s prints all over this
place.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What’s that, Ed?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: There’s no such thing as a bad coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy/laurent</strong>: Renee?</p>
<p><strong>mr. eddy/laurent</strong>: What the fuck? What’s going
on?</p>
