<p><strong>–baaaaaammm!</strong>: Glass doors explode OPEN and Pig Nose
#1 SPINS inside. He fires a burst into the ceiling. BRRAAMM!!</p>
<p><strong>pig nose #1</strong>: EVERYBODY on the floor!</p>
<p><strong>very fast here–</strong>: Two bandits handle BANK EMPLOYEES
and customers– Another PIG NOSE watches the door– Pig Nose #1 moves
behind counter, Uzi and canvas sack in hand.</p>
<p><strong>binoculars</strong>: Bingo. We’re on. Let’s go. Where’s the
big college quarterback?! Are you with us, Utah?</p>
<p><strong>binoculars</strong>: Utah, where the hell are ya!?</p>
<p><strong>pig nose #1</strong>: Fuckin’ shake it!</p>
<p><strong>lady pignose</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Halt. FBI!</p>
<p><strong>pig nose #1</strong>: I wanna say just two words to you,
asshole, SIMU-LATION!!! Johnny- fuckin’ Utah. Guys like you will do
anything to win!</p>
<p><strong>binoculars</strong>: This far, Utah! You’re this far from
being the most overqualified guy Burger King ever had. Get me?!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Yes sir. Sir?</p>
<p><strong>binoculars</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I did stop the perpetrators.</p>
<p><strong>lights and buzzers.</strong>: Pig Nose explodes. More agents
restrain him. Screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys. Utah
walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign which bears the FBI
SEAL and reads “Combat Village, Quantico, Virginia.”</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Anywhere? You don’t care?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Anywhere. I’ve just never seen the ocean
before.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Day One in LA, special agent Utah. You may
have been top two percent of your class at Quantico but you have exactly
zero hours in the field here. You know nothing…</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: You know less than nothing. If you even knew
that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: All the food groups? Avoiding sugar? Caffeine?
I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness. We stay off
hard liquor, cigarettes…</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I take the skin off chicken.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: This is us. Bank Robbery. And you’re in the
bank-robbery capital of the world–</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: 1322 last year in LA county. Up 26 percent
from the year before.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: That’s right. And we nailed over a thousand of
them. We did it by crunching data. Good crime-scene work, good lab work,
good data-base analysis. Nobody had to tackle a car once. You getting
the signal, special agent?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Zero distortion, sir.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I love these things.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: You’re a real blue-flame special, aren’t you,
Utah? I don’t know why they sent you to LA. Must be an asshole
shortage.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Not so far.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: The dolls love this baby. It brings them
luck when they rub it – right between their buttons.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Angelo, we need a bigger tape.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Just read the goddamn number.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Still a 46. Maybe we can cinch it down, wear
a girdle–</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Screw you and this holistic fitness crap! At
least my arms don’t flap in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>big shoulders</strong>: Okay, Pappas, let’s put on the
blindfold. Wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: I’ve been in the field 33 years, fired my
piece 23 times in the line of duty, and I got no idea what a blind man
fetching bricks has gotta do with being a Special Agent!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Added to which indignity, I got three months
left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of
Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or
something.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: The shit they pull, huh?</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Here he comes. Hold up a fish, he’ll take it
right outta your hand.</p>
<p><strong>corey</strong>: Hey Shamu, this is your guy.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Pappas. Angelo Pappas.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Punk. Quarterback Punk.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Welcome to Sea World, kid.</p>
<p><strong>series of tight shots</strong>: ECU sweep hand of a dive
watch clicks through the seconds. Magnum shells are fed into a pump
shotgun. Velcro straps of Second Chance body armor are fastened. White
gloves are pulled snug over strong hands. A silk tie is straightened. A
shotgun slide is cocked. The sweep hand approaches the twelve. A LATEX
MASK is pulled over the back of a man’s head.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The little hand says…</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: … let’s rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: Use a gun, go to heaven.</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: EVERYBODY FREEZE!! That’s right. ALL TELLERS
step back from the counter! Hands on heads! MOVE!!</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: Everybody else on the floor! Do it! On the
floor, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: SUCK LINOLEUM, BITCH!! You got earwax?!</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: Just stay cool. Everybody stay cool. Heads
down. Eyes down. The money’s insured–</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: – it’s not worth dying for. Another 45
seconds of your time. That’s all. Then – Whoa, Tricky Dick!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Twenty-seven banks in three years. In and
out in 90 seconds. Nobody ever gets shot. We’re talking solid
professionals.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Good move.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Yeah, they control the room well. Stick
strictly to the cash drawers.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: They don’t go for the vault?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Never go for the vault. They never get
greedy.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Smart. You burn time in the vault.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Reagan usually drives. Stolen switch car,
they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance. When
they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish. And I mean vanish.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Surgical. Look at them separate the dye packs.
Dick and Ronny know their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: The Ex-Presidents are the best I’ve seen,
kid.</p>
<p><strong>munoz</strong>: Anytime you two are finished jerking off
watching MTV I need to get a look at that tape.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your theory on
the Presidents?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Just take the tape, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>munoz</strong>: Hang ten, Pappas, like totally rad… I gotta
tell ya, the department loves it.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What’s he talking about, Angelo?</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: They found the drop car up on Mulholland. I
want you two to go work it.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: What? Now I’m working the drop car? Who’s
handling the scene here?</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Cole and Munoz. I’m uh… letting them run with
the ball for a while.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Cole and Munoz? I been on this case for two
years.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: That’s the point, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Yeah, I get it. Time to play let’s dick the
old guys, huh, Harp?</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want
you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Sure. No problem. How about your office?
Your office need vacuuming? We could do that too.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Cute huh? They love to fuck with us.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Don’t tell me, let me guess. The switch-car
was stolen this morning… They vacuumed and 409’d the interior, did the
windows, emptied the ashtrays…</p>
<p><strong>halsey</strong>: Yeah, the usual drill.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Could’ve taken their gloves off before setting
that card. Laser it for prints. Maybe held it to his teeth – check the
edges for saliva. Today was a scorcher. This Chevy doesn’t have air
conditioning…</p>
<p><strong>halsey</strong>: Sweat secretions in the seatbacks?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: You through, Mr. Wizard? Let me know if you
find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you’re at it. Hell, it’s only
7:30. The night’s still young… you can solve this case and start on
another one.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Well, what’re your ideas on these guys?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Forget about it, kid. They’re ghosts. Let
the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. See I’m
almost 55… so I must be senile, right? They better get me out before I
start pissing myself in public. Drooling. It would look bad for the
Bureau, right?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: So you’re gonna coast to retirement, when you
could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: You watch your fucking mouth! Mr. Hoover
himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Yeah. That was thirty years ago anyway.
L.A.’s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got
clean. So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents? Be a big hero?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Yeah. What’s your theory?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: The fucking punks are surfers.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: I’m tellin’ ya, kid, it’s in our face.
Lookit the tan on this guy.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Oh well he must be a surfer.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Shutup, you might learn somethin’ you’re not
careful… So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a
soil sample. Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah… sand
and… carnuba wax. So I became a wax expert. There’s 80 some uses for
this stuff, something like five hundred products.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Candle wax. Car wax. Mustache wax? Could be
anything. Guy’s waxing his mustache at the beach. Gets sand in it. Wipes
it off with a shoe. Shoe scuffs the counter.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: The lab made three possible matches, this
was one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Sex wax? You’re not into kinky shit, are you
Angelo?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Surfers use it on their boards. They rub
sand into it for traction.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Thanks for the tip. I needed this
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Now lookit the dates on the robberies. This
is strictly a summer job for these guys.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: … Four months. June to October. Mmmm…same the
year before.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Another month and we don’t see ’em again
’til next summer.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: They’re traveling the rest of the year on the
money, going where the waves are…</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to finance
their endless summer!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I think he needs a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: “Best for your stick”, huh? This might not
be enough. I better get two.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I’m twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Johnny, it’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Why can’t I just walk around with this thing
under my arm and act stoned? Ask a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Look. Look at them out there.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: They’re like some kind of tribe. Got their
own language. You can’t just walk up to these guys. You’ve got to get
out there. Learn some moves. Get into their head. Pick up the
speech.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people
who don’t shave yet.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: It’s all balance, right? And coordination.
How hard can it be?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: I think you gotta hit them straight on!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Got it…</p>
<p><strong>local</strong>: Outta the way, you dick!</p>
<p><strong>local 2</strong>: Move it, kook!</p>
<p><strong>shoots out.</strong>: It SMASHES SIDEWAYS INTO RAZORHEAD. The
guy does an ugly endo. Utah comes up GASPING for air, arms flailing. His
board, floating a few feet away, tugging at his ankle. He drapes his
torso across the board and pants for breath. Razorhead, already back on
his board, paddles over. Points to a small dent in the fiberglass.</p>
<p><strong>razorhead</strong>: You dinged my board, kook!!</p>
<p><strong>a crushing right hook smacks his face!</strong>: Knocks him
under. Razorhead pulls a KNIFE from a sheath held by a thong around his
neck. As Johnny surfaces, Razorhead slashes in a vicious arc– Severing
Utah’s leash, close to the board. His flame-job surfboard bobs away.</p>
<p><strong>razorhead</strong>: Politeness counts, ASSHOLE!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Goddamn son-of-a–</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Kid, maybe this ain’t your sport.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>ocean break</strong>: A horizon of whitecaps churn behind
him. He lies on his board, rising and dropping with the swell. So far so
good. He spots a wave. A fluid gray-green house rising, forever rising.
Utah turns. Paddles. The house catching him, lifting him high upon its
roof.</p>
<p><strong>woman surfer</strong>: Swim, goddammit! Come on! Move it!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Look crazy son of a bitch! You wanna commit
suicide, you do it someplace else!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Look at this pig-board piece-a-shit. It’s
still got the price tag on it, for Chrissakes. What’d you do, buy it
yesterday? You’ve got no business out here whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Well, I saw you and–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a
mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn’t have any
problem. Right?! Well you figured wrong, dork!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Hey! Uh, how do I get back in?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: My name’s Johnny Utah!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Who cares!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I’m telling you so when you look back on this
moment, you can think… there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty
much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in
conditions he had no business being in whatsoever… when I could have
easily helped him.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Wait! Jesus Christ! You’re fucking crazy, you
know that? You go in there you’re gonna eat it on the rocks. Here,
follow me.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Go when I say. But stay down. Just lie on the
board. Alright, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: This is your surfer contact? Female. Blond
hair. Green eyes. 5’6”. 119 lbs?</p>
<p><strong>miss deer</strong>: Hmm, not bad, Utah.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Tyler Ann Endicott. Born 11-27-64.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: … Exhibition of speed. Indecent exposure
inside moving vehicle…</p>
<p><strong>miss deer</strong>: Hot, very hot.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Felony arrest! “See adjoining file”…
Kidnapping?!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: This is great. She ties some guy up. Nude.
Leaves the scene and fails to return for 24 hours. No convection.</p>
<p><strong>miss deer</strong>: Gotta avoid the rope tricks, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What else they got on her? I still haven’t
found anything I can really use. I gotta find an approach, a way in –
here we go… Both parents deceased. Plane crash. San Diego, ’84. Mmmm.
Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Next! Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Shrimp and fries.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I mean, what do you want? What are you doing
hanging around here.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I need you to teach me.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go!
Anything to drink?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I can see that. But forget it. Stick to
tennis, or whatever you’re good at. Miniature golf. Here, your number’s
37.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Well, I’m just gonna go back out there till I
catch on to it or break my neck.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What is it? You all of a sudden got this bug
you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No, no. See, all my life I’ve done things for
other people. In high school I played football because my old man
expected me to. Then my parents always figured I’d go to law school, so
I did. Football scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta Kappa–</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: This gonna take long?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Wait, so I’m a big hero to my folks, right?
But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly
realized all my goals had been their goals. And I hadn’t been living my
own life. So I wanted something for myself. Something that maybe didn’t
make any sense. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I came out here from Ohio a month ago. Never
saw the ocean before. I didn’t think it would effect me so much. Like
I’m drawn to it, or something. I want to do what you do. It’s the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Tomorrow, 6 AM. Here. If you’re a minute late
I’m gone. And Stud… I didn’t take you to raise. I can show you a few
things but after that you’re on your own. That’ll be four fifty.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Keep the change, Teach.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Stop here. Do you agree to do exactly what I
say when I say it?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Do it again.</p>
<p><strong>cloudy platinum dawn…</strong>: Tyler shouting at Utah as he
fights for balance. He flies off again.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’m not with him.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: It’s closing out completely. Let’s call
it.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: That’s Bodhi. They call his the
Bodhisattva.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: The modern savage. Guy’s even crazier than
you, Johnny Utah. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Brah!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Hey Tyler!</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: The fuck you doin’ man?! You fuckin’
crazy?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Chill, brah. You know who this is? Johnny
Utah. Ohio State, all- conference. Rose Bowl three years ago. Right?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Johnny fuckin’ Utah! Fuckin’-A! Yeah, I
remember that game, man. You were on-fire. They could not stop your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Radical! Head-butt, dude!!</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Head-butt!!!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Something happened. You got nuked in the last
quarter.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the
wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: And that’s why you never went pro?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Two years of surgery. I missed my window.
Limped through law school instead.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Mmm. A lawyer, huh? Too bad. But at least
you’re surfing now. So your life’s not over yet, right?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Like totally rad stick, dude.</p>
<p><strong>several agents</strong>: Gnarly, man… hang ten… cowabunga…
surf patrol… rip it up!</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: How was the beach?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Surf conditions okay?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: A little mushy.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: A little mushy! You think the taxpayers would
like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and
pick up girls?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Babes.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: The correct term is babes, sir. Uh, this type
of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of
the speech. Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social
infrastructure, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Where is Pappas?</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Special Agent Utah, this is not some job
flippin’ burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me. Yes,
your approach to this case bothers me. And yes, you bother me. You two
have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex-
Presidents have robbed two more banks!! Do you have anything even
remotely interesting to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Caught my first tube this morning.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: What, you couldn’t have just left the thing
in your car?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: It sticks out, so I can’t lock it. Look,
Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf? This was your
lame-o idea in the first place. You gotta back me up on this.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Johnny, all I can say is we better come up
with something real soon.</p>
<p><strong>miss deer</strong>: Encino Savings &amp; Loan guard grabbed
LBJ’s ponytail. We recovered one hair.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year. Guy got
his jaw broken for it.</p>
<p><strong>miss deer</strong>: One four centimeter strand. Color brown.
Oily. Slight wave.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Hell, what’re we waiting for, let’s go pick
the guy up.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Angelo, pay attention. There’s gonna be a test
afterward. Lab is showing traces of toxins. PCBs. Heavy elements…
selenium, titanium and arsenic.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Guy’s the Toxic Avenger.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: The beaches are always being closed because of
waste spills, right? And surfers are territorial. They stick mostly to
certain breaks. If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a
certain beach, we’d know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin’
this?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: No. But let’s do it, anyway. It’s gonna bug
the shit out of Harp.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: When you two are done makin’ out, I need to
talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>“psycho-stick” t-shirt</strong>: Hey, I ain’t no
butt-bouncer, dude. We’re from the valley. Mall babes ’n shit.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: I just want to know if you surf here a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>“passion for slashin’” t-shirt</strong>: Shit yeah, like
totally everyday when it’s jammin’. What is this, fucking narco
entrapment or what, dude?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Not exactly, dudes.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Whoa, brah, easy now… Don’t move! Got some
huge sucker crawling into your– Got it! Uuuughhh.</p>
<p><strong>surf-rat</strong>: Leave some fuckin’ hair, man!</p>
<p><strong>surf-rat</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Saved your butt, bro. Close one.</p>
<p><strong>halsey</strong>: Naw, this isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: He moved.</p>
<p><strong>halsey</strong>: PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic. The
percentages look right. Here’s a match.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Latigo Beach.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Surf’s up, ace.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Big zippo so far. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Patience hotshot. Patience. It’ll be subtle,
if it’s here at all.</p>
<p><strong>warchild</strong>: This the guy?</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Okay, so this is where you tell me all about
how locals rule and yuppie insects like me shouldn’t be surfing your
break and all that, right?</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tone</strong>: Waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>warchild</strong>: We’re just going to fuck you up.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Johnny? You there?</p>
<p><strong>archbold</strong>: The dude can fight!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Back off! Now!! Just let it go!</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: Stay outta this, Bodhi!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: He’s with me. Now back off. Seriously.Just do
it! You alright Warchild?</p>
<p><strong>warchild</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: Bunker.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Well, listen, Bunker… I’m actually kinda glad
you found me.</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: Yeah? Why?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! Hold it, ladies. Give it a rest.
Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10, 12,
running with a car stereo? Stole the fucking CD too, you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No, but there are four guys back there you
might check out.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Thanks, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Friends of yours, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big
one is his brother, Warchild. The other two always hang. They think
they’re some kinda death squad around here.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What’s their program?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: They’re punks. Nazis. Their brains are wired
wrong. They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have
no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical. It’s mindless
aggression. They’ll never get it, the spiritual side of it.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You always talk like this? You’re not gonna
start chanting or anything are you?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: No. So I was up the beach. I saw it going
down. you didn’t hesitate… they never backed you up an inch. That’s rare
in this world.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Thanks for stepping in.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: De nada.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Gonna be some people at my house tonight.
Maybe you can make it.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Come with Tyler. She knows.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Ten seconds you’re out of sight.
Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You’re losin’ them. That’s right.
Two-denver-four-sam- niner-five-niner. Late seventies Jeep.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Look, if you’re gonna go leavin’ your piece
and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Okay, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: The jeep is registered to a Bradley Wiess. My
buddy. Guy’s got quite a sheet. Yeah, yeah… skip all that. Gimme the
greatest hits. Misdemeanor possession of cocaine. That’s good…</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: … Felony B and E, three months in juvey.
Better. Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent. I’m
lovin’ it. What about the brother? Great! Another model citizen. These
guys really fit the profile.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but
not all losers are bank robbers.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: These are the guys. I can feel it. I say we
lay it on Harp.</p>
<p><strong>munoz</strong>: This is bullshit. This is a bullshit lead.
This is totally bullshit. Harp must be fucking desperate if he’s
listening to you two flakes.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: See you bright and early, guys.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Cold pizza? It’s great for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: When did Harp say they’d have the warrant?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: He’s pushing it through first thing. You
better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Nice place.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: He rents it for the summer. Bodhi always gets
some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around. Most a
these guys can’t keep a job. When the swell comes, they’re gone, they
have to ride.</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Do your worst, man!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Don’t you gamble?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Only make bets I can’t afford to lose. Only
way to be 100% committed.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Who’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Catch of the day.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Oh, oh. That sounds personal.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: People are expendable to Bodhi.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Meaning you were expendable.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: We went out for about five minutes… which is
four minutes longer than most of them. But you can’t hold it against
him, he’s… different.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Sure, he’s “the Bodhisattva”.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Yeah, he thinks he’s evolved to a higher
plane of existence, or something. Maybe he has. You’ve seen him surf…
that frenzy. It seems like anger. It’s not. It’s the energy of
lovemaking. The sea is the woman in his life. She’s his only true
lover.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: All she does is beat the shit out of me.</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel</strong>: … Okay, so you’re in the face, it’s
twenty-five feet straight down, your balls are about this big. And the
whole thing’s moving, right, roaring like you’re stuck to the front of a
freight train. There ain’t nothin’ like it, man. The ultimate rush.
Forget about sex, it doesn’t even come close.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: You lose it right then, you’re history. The
fish’ll be pickin’ you outta the coral.</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel</strong>: Thanks, brah.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: See, it’s all dynamic, it’s all in motion.
You can’t just stop and walk on in to the beach if you don’t like the
way things are going, y’ know what I mean? You gotta ride it out man,
all the way.</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: You ride the monsters, you gotta know
you’re ridin’ a line between life and death. There ain’t no
forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: So what’s the biggest? Waimea?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: No, Bells Beach, Australia.</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Shit, yeah! I remember that day… gnarly
fuckin’ ass! Was your birthday–</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: The set was northwest. Jacking up like a
fucking mountain of gray glass–</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: I made that one mistake you pray you’ll never
make–</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel</strong>: You shoulda fuckin’ seen it… it was like
he fell for-ever. Then the curl crashes down and he’s gooone–</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: – held down in the washing machine, man… it
was severe, we couldn’t see nothin’ thought it was all over for
sure–</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Not tragic to die doing what you love. You
want the ultimate thrill, you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate
price.</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel</strong>: Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Hell, I ain’t gonna see 30.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Uh. I need another beer.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope
you’re not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi’s
moonies.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: I’ve seen that kamikaze look, Johnny. You’ve
got it. And Bodhi can smell it a mile away. He’ll take you to the edge…
and past it. Hey, Bodhi.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Johnny has his own demons, don’t you,
Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Feel it?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Gentlemen, it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Swell’s here, Johnny. Bodhi always knows.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Let’s go, Utah. Time for a little stealth
mission.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Gaping barrels! Way overhead, man!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I can barely do this in broad daylight.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Come on. At least no one’s gonna see how bad
you are.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I gotta be fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Yeah, but are you crazy enough?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Football’s a man-made game. You keep score
with numbers. But in this, there’s no field, no rules, no opponent. Just
you and the wave.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I know that part. Tell me something I can use,
here.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: I’ve watched you once or twice. You surf like
it’s some kind of street fight. You jerk along from moment to moment,
fighting everything that comes at you. Always trying to win.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: A flaw I’m working on.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: The only way to win out here is to surrender.
You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.
Just feel it all moving in the blackness… you don’t need to see.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: This one’s got your name on it, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Shit, I’m gonna die. I’m gonna die now.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You had enough?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Yeah. I just want to sit out here for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Well, usually you have this sort of intense
scowl of concentration, like you’re doing this for a school project or
something… I don’t know, like something’s driving you. See, it’s gone.
If I didn’t know better I’d say you looked almost happy.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I… I don’t know. I can’t describe what I’m
feeling.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Goosebumps. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Those are cold.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Warm them up.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You guys need any help?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever
show up?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Right here, partner.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Good of you to join us, hotshot. Watch it. I
told you, not on the hairs, goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I’m ready to rock, Angelo. Where you want
me?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.
Babbit is backing me. So I want you at the side window by the hedge.
You’re strictly backup, got it?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Awright. Get into position. I’m rolling.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Here Scooby! Where are you boy? Here
Scooby!! You furball piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>fiberglass</strong>: Yeah? What?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Have you seen a little dog? Kind of a
cockapoo lookin’ thing. About this big.</p>
<p><strong>fiberglass</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Babbit. Get Angelo out of there. They’re
pulling out a fucking arsenal! Babbit, you copy? Cole? Don’t let him
pull his badge!</p>
<p><strong>munoz</strong>: Utah, say again. What? I can’t hear jack shit
over this lawnmower. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: … and the guy next door said he saw it go
into your backyard. My wife’ll kill me if I lose the little bastard. Me,
I could care less. Whole house smells from it’s liftin’ its leg all the
time…</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: Something’s goin’ down, man. This ain’t
right.</p>
<p><strong>tone</strong>: No, man, it’s nothin’. It’s nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: Will you shut the fuck up! Check the
windows. Do it!!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: You sure he isn’t out back? You mind if I go
take a look?</p>
<p><strong>fiberglass</strong>: Look, I don’t know anything about your
dog, okay–</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Well is there anyone else here that might
have seen him?</p>
<p><strong>fiberglass</strong>: There’s nobody else here…</p>
<p><strong>warchild</strong>: There’s two guys by the back door. Ducked
down.</p>
<p><strong>tone</strong>: Oh, shit. Shit!! We’re fucked, man.</p>
<p><strong>bunker</strong>: That fat fuck comes through the door I’m
gonna pump him up. Swear to Christ, man, I’m gonna blow the dude up!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: FBI, gorgeous. Now let’s take a look
around–</p>
<p><strong>blam!</strong>: It rips the plaster next to Johnny’s
shoulder. Shatters the shower door behind him. The BLACK-HAIRED GIRL
screams. Johnny flinches, FIRING RAPIDLY. Wild. Bunker drops, hit.
Warchild lets go with the 12 gauge. KABOOM! Takes a chunk like a shark
bite out of the doorframe by Johnny’s head. Deafening in the confined
space. Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe. Tone just splits.
Down the hall like a greyhound.</p>
<p><strong>warchild</strong>: Move it, man. Let’s get the fuck out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>pappas appears behind them.</strong>: He aims the .38. FIRES
TWICE. The little Briggs &amp; Stratton dies young, its casing
shattered. The rotor spins to a stop. Warchild looks up into the black
eye of Pappas’ gun. Two inched from his face.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Speak into the microphone.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: It’s always been lasers and paper targets
until today, right?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: No difference, Utah. Just a little more to
clean up. It’s alright. You did good today.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>dietz</strong>: You know what this is?! Two keys uncut
crystal meth!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What the hell’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>dietz</strong>: You think I like this haircut? My wife wants
me to stay at Ramada – I been working on these guys for THREE MONTHS!
Finally – finally– – I get dickwad in there wantin’ to play wheel of
fortune so I can find out their supplier!</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: This is agent Dietz, DEA. He’s got a record of
your suspect’s movements every day for the last three months.</p>
<p><strong>dietz</strong>: All I wanna know is how are these guys
supposed to be holding up Tarzana City National on August 2nd, when they
are in Fort-fucking- Lauderdale August 2ND!!!</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Not an easy thing to do, is it, Utah?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Aw shit.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Nice tattoo, Dietz.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: C’mon brah, there’s a righteous swell. Let’s
go! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: He does this.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Come on, Utah. Everybody’s out there catchin’
all the good rides.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What’s wrong Johnny? You’re like a different
person.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I am a different person, Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hey. You okay? You look like you saw a
ghost.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Forget about it, kid, They’re ghosts…</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I… I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Johnny… what’s going on? I don’t get it… did
I do something?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No. I’m sorry. I have to go. I’ll, uh… I’ll
call you later. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Hey, babe. Get on over here so the big dog
can teach ya how to bark.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Woof, woof.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Johnny! Uh, you, uh… should call first, you
know? Hey, where the hell were you all day? You gotta at least call in
or something. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Angelo, we gotta talk.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Listen, uh… if you’re okay, can it wait till
tomorrow morning, kid,</p>
<p><strong>miss deer</strong>: Angie, they didn’t have the kind of wine
you like but I got… oh, hi Johnny!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: … so I started tailing him.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: This Zen master surfer.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Bodhi, yeah. I’m on him all day, right. He
goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he
has lunch at Patrick’s Road House… … he goes into the Assured Trust
Savings and Loan.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Did he rob it?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Cute. He was inside for about 20 minutes. The
other guy, Roach, waited in the truck. They were scoping it out,
right?!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Yeah, or cashing a check.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Wait, wait. Then these guys go back to their
beach house and box up all their shit. Load it in Bodhi’s truck and take
it to a public storage unit. You see? Summer’s almost over. They’re
splitting. They’re gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. The
next day at the outside latest. I got a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a
man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Angelo… I’m right this time. We can still win
this one.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Alright, look… banks are closed. Nothing’s
gonna go down tonight, right? So we’ll be on these guys like white on
rice… first thing tomorrow morning. Okay? Tomorrow. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Woof, woof.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: They’re gone. Son of a bitch. We missed
them.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: They’re on their way to Maui.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No way. Not yet. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Jesus Christ, kid! The banks don’t open
’till nine.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I say we call it in. Get some backup. But you
gotta do it. Harp won’t listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Sure. No problem. I’ll just call up and tell
him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday
and it looked real suspicious. Shit, he’ll probably call out the
National Guard.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I say we don’t call it in. Under no
circumstance are we to call this in.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now,
okay? We cover the bank, whatever. You and me. That way if nothing
happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens… I don’t get my tits
any further into the wringer than they already are.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Time for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Angelo, it’s eleven thirty.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: That place up the street has meatball
sandwiches. Get me two.</p>
<p><strong>voice from inside</strong>: Two meatball, one tuna on wheat,
two lemonades. Total’s seven eighty four.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Here, yours is the one that looks like a road
kill. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Here’s your lemonade. Did you see that T-Bird
pull up?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Damn, I could eat the ass out of an
elephant. I shoulda had you get me three a these. What T-Bird?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Jesus Christ!! It’s them!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: FBI!! Freeze!! Right now!</p>
<p><strong>blam! blam! blam!</strong>: He puts two into the trunk and
blows the back window into junk jewelry. The T-Bird peels out into
traffic, clipping a Subaru which locks them up and spins.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Come on, kid, get in the car! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: The hell are they?!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: They took a left at the next light!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You sure?!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I got ’em. I see ’em. I’m on it, I’m on
it.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: You even watching the road?</p>
<p><strong>lbj</strong>: Where are they, man? I don’t see ’em. We lose
’em?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Nice fuckin’ work, hotshot. Christ!</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: Emergency sanitization! Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>nixon</strong>: Let’s go! Move it, Ronny!</p>
<p><strong>a figure blurs into frame.</strong>: In a flying tackle, Utah
catapults Reagan off his pins. They roll, skidding across the oily
concrete. Spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Get the fuck out of this house! What the fuck
do you think you’re doing–</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Not now. Not now!</p>
<p><strong>utah has the beretta pointed right at him.</strong>: Twenty
feet away. The muzzle rock-steady. He can’t miss. They both are frozen,
panting. Locked into the moment.</p>
<p><strong>reagan</strong>: You want me, there’s only one way.</p>
<p><strong>he howls with rage, frustration and pain.</strong>: FIRES
AGAIN. And AGAIN. Slumping back, his shoulders slam down onto the
concrete. Straight-arming the Beretta he FIRES RAPIDLY… Bulleting the
blue sky.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Go home, kid. Get the hell outta here. Get
some sleep. You look like shit. They get anything even resembles your
guy, I’m on your beeper. Here. You like feta?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Feta. My favorite.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: All I wanna know is one thing, why didn’t
you just take the shot?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Betadyne doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You’re kneeling on my hand.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: So what’d the other guy look like?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: But you look like you been in a train wreck,
how’d he just drive away?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Johnny, what is it with you? You have that
look again, it’s like you’re about to tell me something and then you
don’t… or you can’t. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: What? What do you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I’m glad you pulled me out of the water that
day…</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: A lawyer!? You lied to me!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Look, Tyler, I can–</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Jesus Christ, Johnny – you’ve been using me!
Your jacket’s on the floor in the bathroom – this goddamn thing’s half
out of the pocket… Oh God, it’s all part of some case, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Tyler, put the gun down.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: You tell me the fucking truth Johnny… did
your parents really die in a car crash? DID THEY?!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No. They live in Columbus Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I work bank robbery. Guys I’m after are
surfers. I needed you, at first, but not–</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Fuck you, Johnny Utah. Fuck you!! Don’t you
have a soul? Goddamn you to hell!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Tyler! Wait!!</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: Hi, it’s me. Leave a message.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Tyler I… look, I fucked up, okay. I know I
fucked up. I wanted to tell you, but I couldn’t – I was afraid you’d
leave… good guess, huh? Fuck, why can’t I ever say what I really mean? I
lied to you. I’m an asshole… but I need you, Tyler. I want you to know
that I’ve never known anyone like you before in my life… and I… I hope
you change your mind…</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Tyler! Wait, I–</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Howdy brah.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: C’mon, get your gear on, we’re rollin’.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What going on, Bodhi?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Here. Hey, what happened? Ya cut yourself
shaving?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I don’t think I wanna surf right now.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Naw, this is different, Johnny. This is
something totally different… you’re gonna love this.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: C’mon, let’s go, let’s go. Time’s wastin’,
brah.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Life’s sure got a sick sense of humor, don’t
you think so Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: How you figure?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: News, last night… those guys, the
Ex-Presidents… they robbed my bank yesterday. And I was just there the
day before, cashing a check. See… look. Assured Trust… same place.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: I was picking up some bucks cause we’re
leaving town. Bizarre, huh? If I’d waited a day I’d been right in the
middle of it. Kinda sorry I missed it. I’d liked to’ve seen them.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Takes guts to rob a bank. All that adrenalin
pumping, waving loaded guns, taking out the guards, getting everybody on
the floor, never knowin’ who’s gonna burst in… … wondering what it’s
like to take a bullet. Must be some ride.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Banks are insured, brah. Long as nobody gets
shot, it’s really a victimless crime. Just gotta scare ‘em a little,
would be my guess. Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with all those guys
wearin’ body armor these days, know what I’d carry?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: .454 Casull. Most powerful handgun on the
planet. Muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second. Twice the kinetic
energy of a .44 Magnum.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: One shot stopping.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: ‘One shot stopping’… good, very good. I like
you, Johnny. I like you because you’ll sacrifice anything to win. I
respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned
compromise. Here, hold it. Check out the weight.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Whoa. Careful. You got the muzzle pointing
right at me, brah.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: It’s a special day, Johnny U. A very special
day…</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Ever done this before?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Once.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Pure adrenalin, right?! The ultimate rush.
Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it – all you gotta do is
jump.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Sure, it’s a blast, but listen, I sorta
screwed up my knee yesterday–</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Yeah, I noticed you limping. But don’t worry
about it, brah. Don’t worry at all. We’re not gonna land on land!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Oh, well, that’s fine then. I feel so much
better.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: It’s a little ceremony we always have at the
end of summer. One last speedstar.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: So, who… uh, who packed my chute?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: I did. What’s the matter? Don’t trust me?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You gotta earn trust.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Then we’ll earn it together. Here, take
mine.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Hey… you don’t want Bodhi’s, man. His
pack-jobs suck… they only open half the time. Take Grommet’s, man.</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Whoa, unfair, dude!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: We gonna jump or jerk off?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: My man!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Utah, you copy bruddah?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Whoooaaah! Shhiiittt! Whoooaaah!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: I’ll take that as a yes.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Whip it out dudes! Cheap sex with the
cosmos!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Ten thousand feet. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Come on Johnny. Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Relax, brah. I got you, I got you.</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Righteous-ass speedstar, dudes!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: You diggin’ this?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Great! GREAT!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Purty-thirty and we’re meat waffles, folks.
See ya downtown!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: You gonna pull?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: After you, Alfonse. I insist!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Don’t screw around man, pull it!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You do it… you first!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: One thousand feet. Pull the goddamn cord!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You first!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Jesus Christ. I gotta be losin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Ya see… I told you Johnny U was gonna be just
fine!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: C’mere. There’s something you need to
see.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Insurance policy. Now this is going to sting
a bit, but it’s for your own growth, brah. Press play.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: She’s a wild one, isn’t she… Special Agent
Utah?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You’re a fucking dead man–</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Whoa, whoa!! Think it through! I’m the only
one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Talk.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: She’ll be fine, Rosie won’t do anything. At
least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about…
let’s see… … six hours from now.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You call him… right now… and tell him to let
her go.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Sorry, can’t do it, brah. He’s on the road.
And where they’re going there’s no phones. Damn, I hate this Johnny, I
really do. I hate violence. See, that’s why I need Rosie. I could never
make this thing work, myself. No way I could hold a knife to Tyler’s
throat, man! She was my woman, once. We shared time in this world. But
Rosie, he’s kind of a… mechanism. Once you set him in motion, he won’t
stop. That’s his gift, a kind of… blankness. Noon comes, straight up,
he’ll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes. Nothing I
can do, unless I get there.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: So that makes us partners, doesn’t it?
Because now we both have the same goal… to get me where I need to go.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: We’re wasting time.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: See! That’s what I like about you, man!
You’re just sharp as a razor blade.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Get the plane down to Santa Monica and top up
the tanks. Let’s go. Let’s saddle up!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Okay. All I’m askin’ for is ninety seconds of
your life, Johnny. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: It’s basic dog psychology, brah. If you scare
them, get them pissing down their leg, they submit… you control them. If
you project weakness, you draw aggression… that’s how people get
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will
cause your worst fears to come true. You project strength to avoid
conflict.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Peace through superior firepower, babe.</p>
<p><strong>gauge.</strong>: Pockets the shells. Tosses the weapon to
Utah.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Here, you need this. You can’t be comin’
through that door with your dick in your hands, right?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Sure you can! You may even like it… it’s a
killer rush. You’ll see. Hey, don’t I show you things, Johnny U?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man – I… am…
an… Eff… Bee… Eye… Agent!!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Wild, ain’t it?! See, we exist on a higher
plane, you and I. We make our own rules. Why be a servant of the law
Johnny U… when you can be it’s master?</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Fuckin’ A!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Ninety seconds, man, door to door. A small
price to pay for someone who loves you. She does you know. It’s not her
style to fall so hard… I don’t think she did with me.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Sorry, Johnny. Guess you don’t get to be
president.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Rock and roll!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Everybody freeze!! Don’t move!!</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Don’t fucking do it, man!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi/reagan</strong>: All Tellers back away from the
counter! Hands on your heads! RIGHT NOW!! That’s right. You know the
drill.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi/reagan</strong>: All customers on the floor. Let’s go!
Move it! Get down! On the floor! Right now! Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: On the floor, asshole! What’s your problem?! I
blow your fucking kneecaps out, you’ll be on the floor!!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi/reagan</strong>: Kick in the ass, ain’t it? Gonna be
kinda hard to explain though… when they play the tapes back down at the
bureau. Could look bad on your monthly evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Can we just get the goddamn money and get out
of here?!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi/reagan</strong>: That’s the spirit!! Head’s down! Eyes
down! Just a couple minutes of your life and we’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi/reagan</strong>: You! Miss Jennings… of New Accounts.
Be a dear and open the inner gate for my associate. NOW!!</p>
<p><strong>miss jennings</strong>: He – he – he has the keys.
Mr. Duggan.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi/reagan</strong>: Whatta say, Mr. Duggan? Wanna give her
the keys or do I pick through the blood and chunks for them?</p>
<p><strong>duggan</strong>: Do whatever they say, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You’re blowing it, man! You’re breaking your
own rules… pulling too much time!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi/reagan</strong>: JFK, how we doin’?</p>
<p><strong>nathaniel/jfk</strong>: All clear, man!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Federal agent! Undercover!</p>
<p><strong>blam!!!</strong>: All of them wild, but serving to get
Nathaniel pinned down behind a check-writing island.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Don’t anybody fucking move!</p>
<p><strong>grommet</strong>: Oh no, oh my god, oh god… it’s all comin’
out man, gotta stop it… it’s all gonna come out… do something!!</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: We gotta bug out, man! We’re eatin’ it bad on
this one. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Goodbye, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>munoz</strong>: – if you so desire, an attorney will be
provided for you free of cost. Do you understand these rights I have
explained to you? Utah?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: He knows his goddamn rights! Jesus, kid. I
knew you were getting too close to these guys. Gimme the goddamn key to
these things, Cole. Christ!</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Don’t take those off. Just leave them on! Your
partner’s an accessory to murder. You realize that?</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Three men dead. One of them a cop. How’s that
sit in your gut, Utah?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Take your hand off my shoulder right now.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Look, Harp. Don’t turn him over to the
uniforms like some punk. Let me ride him in.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Yeah, sure. Why not? You two screw-ups deserve
each other. That’s why I put you together in the first place. Christ
Pappas, you’re as bad as he is… talk about the blind leading the
blind–</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Harp, let me tell you something. I was an
agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink
ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still
haven’t?</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: What that?</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Respect your elders. Let’s go kid.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I know where they’re going.</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Figured you did.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Only problem is… we can’t arrest them or shoot
them.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I’m not armed.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: But you’re not alone.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Good guess. There’s a gun on you right
now.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Where’s Roach?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Around somewhere. Listen, I’m in kind of a
hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You gotta tell me where she is.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: And let my policy expire? Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is
over.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: I say when it’s over!</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: The guy you killed was an off duty cop! If you
get out of here they’ll nail you wherever you land. They have a new
thing called radar. Maybe you’ve heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I know you man, when they fall on you, you
won’t back down. They’ll have to burn your ass to the ground. And I
can’t stop them… I’m the last person they’re ready to listen to right
now. Thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Shit may or may not happen.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Look, you got a death wish, you want to ride
to glory… fine! But don’t take her with you, man. I’m begging you… tell
me where she is. Then I walk away. We’ve earned that much trust, haven’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Back in the hotseat, campadre.</p>
<p><strong>bam! bam!</strong>: Roach flips onto his back. The shotgun
blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck. Pappas is on the ground,
totally exposed, 20 feet from the others.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Angelo! Don’t fire!</p>
<p><strong>pappas</strong>: Kid, get outta the way!!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I ain’t flyin’ you guys to San Phillipe man,
forget it. Not now–</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Thanks for telling the nice FBI agent where
we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Get in the fucking plane.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: We’re gonna ride this out, all the way,
Johnny. You and me. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>the screen explodes with a blur of motion.</strong>: POV of
the ground racing below us at 180 mph.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Look, we been in Mexico the last half hour…
can I quit mowing the lawn here or what? I’m getting more brush in the
wheels than I usually like, you know what I’m saying?!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Yeah, get some height. Take her up to eight
thousand on this heading.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: We’re gonna pop up on their screens.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Doesn’t matter now. We’re almost there, man.
Here, let me help you get your gear on.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I’m cold.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: You’re gonna be fine. Just fine. Johnny, toss
me that money bag will you. Easy does it.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You’re cold because all the blood is running
out of your body, Roach. You’re going to be dead soon. I hope it was
worth it.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Hey, Johnny’s just trying to psych you man,
forget it. Just keep thinking about all those senoritas nursin’ you back
to health. Come on, amigo, let’s get you set for the jump.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One, do you
copy, over?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Copy you, Air Force One. We have a visual on
you. Lookin’ fine.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Tell him to release Tyler.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the
order. Let her off the hook, she’s served her purpose. Do it, man, you
owe me that much. Let me hear it before you check out.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Rosie, listen carefully. Surgery is canceled,
is that clear? Repeat it back to me.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Copy you. Surgery is canceled. I’m lettin’
the bitch go.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: I know it’s hard for you Johnny. You want me
so bad it’s like acid in your mouth. But not his time. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: You lose, campadre.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Pull the parachute!!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Pretty radical, Johnny. Even for you. Why
don’t you pull it?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord! Now!!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Naw, you pull it!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Go on, Johnny. Pull it. But you gotta drop
the gun, first! Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on
with?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Pull it right now or I’ll blow your fucking
head off and pull it myself!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Well that’s the only way it’s gonna happen,
man. Do it! Come on, you want to do it. You’re gonna die, Johnny. Five
more seconds. Four…</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: You fucking crazy!? Pull it!!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Three seconds… two… one…</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Wild ride, huh?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Jesus Christ, Bodhi!</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: That pesky knee, huh? Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: You had me worried there, for a second,
Johnny U.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Gonna close early today, mate, ’fore the
bloody storm hits.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: Storm’s already here… It’s bringing me the
swell.</p>
<p><strong>tyler</strong>: John, they’re here.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: D’you see him, Mr. Utah?</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No. But he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Now, look, I know you used to be a
federal agent up in the states and all that, but you’re a citizen now,
so just find him and we’ll handle it from there.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: No problem. Just give me a couple minutes with
him first.</p>
<p><strong>1st surfer</strong>: Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand’s
shakin’.</p>
<p><strong>2nd surfer</strong>: Totally closed-out. It’s fuckin’ death
on a stick.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I knew you wouldn’t miss the fifty year storm,
Bodhi.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: And I always knew I could count on you, Agent
Utah.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I’m not FBI anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: You never were…</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: I asked them to give me a couple minutes…</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: It went bad, brah. Real bad. I just felt it
was time…</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Time to dance with the universe. I could
never handle a jail cell. You’ll do this for me, won’t you Johnny?
Haven’t I earned this much?</p>
<p><strong>bodhi</strong>: Thanks, brah.</p>
<p><strong>utah</strong>: He rode it all the way.</p>
