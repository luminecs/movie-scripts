<h1 id="phone-booth">phone-booth</h1>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: There are 237,911 pay telephones in the
five burroughs of the city of New York. Many of them are still in
working order.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Despite increased usage of cellular
devices, an estimated four and a half million New Yorkers and two
million visitors still utilize pay telephones on a regular basis. At
thirty-five cents a pop… for the first three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: You’re looking at the telephone booth at
the corner of 45th Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of the Manhattan
theatrical district. It has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by
a kiosk. It’s one of the few remaining phone booths left in the
city.</p>
<p><strong>woman in booth</strong>: You have lied to me for the last
time, you lowlife prick bastard! I don’t ever want to hear the sound of
your fucking voice again. Yes, well fuck you, too!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At least three hundred calls daily
originate from this booth. The coins are collected twice a day. This
booth has been burglarized forty-one times in the last six months.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: Stu, we got to talk.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wish I could accommodate you, Mario, but this
is my busy time of day.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: How come you cross the street every time you
go past the restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why don’t I stop in later for some lunch?</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: There’s no more drinks or free meals until
the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m doing my level best for you people.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: One lousy mention in the Post and you expect
to eat for six months!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I got the food critic from the Village Voice
all lined up to give you a review.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: That’s what you tell me last July. And he
never shows.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I was allowing you time to expand the menu.
Wallpaper the bathrooms, for God sakes. You get only one shot with these
fucking critics and I don’t want you to blow a rare opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: You the one blowing it. How long you think
you can fuck everybody?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hold on right there. I’ve got a very excellent
reputation around this town.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: So how come you take two nice suits of
clothes from Harry and never get his daughter on David Letterman?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hell, I’m not an agent. I’m a publicist.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: Mister, you’re nothing!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Believe me, Valerie’s on the waiting list to
audition. Harry’s got no complaints. He just let me pick out this tie
the other day.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: That Harry’s a damn fool!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mario, please let me make this up to you. How
about I arrange for the opening night party for this new off-Broadway
show I’m handling – to be held at your place with local TV coverage on
nine and eleven? I mean I had it promised to another client – who
actually pays me money. But it isn’t firmed up yet. And I could throw it
your way. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: What is involved?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’d toss in the buffet for say seventy or
eighty. The producers would supply their own vino, of course. I’d
deliver you a truckload of celebrities. And if they like the food,
they’ll all come back, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: What celebrities?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You want Liza Minelli? An Oscar winner. Or
Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: Is he still alive?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I saw him last night going into the Four
Seasons. I’ll bring you over a whole VIP list when we come by for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: How come everybody wants to eat but nobody
wants to pay?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You can’t think small like that. Hey, you still
feature musicians Fridays and Saturdays?</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: At least they work for their meals.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What about Harry’s daughter as an extra added
attraction? She’ll belt out five or six showtunes – two sets a night –
and it won’t cost you a fucking nickel.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Star Showcase! Let me handle setting that up.
And when she eventually goes on Letterman, she’ll announce I’m currently
appearing over at Mario’s fine supper club. Right over CBS she’ll say
that, Mario.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: You’re full of shit. You know that? All
bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s just a vulgar word for PR. Mario, you
can’t hurt my feelings. Even when I was a kid and they hurled certain
invectives my way, it never bothered me. Other kids would fall apart if
anybody called them a fucking name. Me, I just loved the attention!
‘Shit-for- brains’ – that’s what the bigger kids named me. And I
answered to it. Hey, ‘shit-for brains’ reporting for duty. Everybody
loved me for that. I could take abuse. After a while, I kind of wore
them down. There was nothing more they could say to me. So they stopped.
I kind of missed it.</p>
<p><strong>mario</strong>: I’m sorry I even talked to you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ll bet your loving wife put you up to this.
She saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street. But I don’t hold
it against you personally – you still serve up superior veal chop. Now I
got urgent business to conduct, Mario.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Where have you been? Do you think I
have nothing to do but wait around for you to call?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m only a few minutes late, loveliest
individual on earth.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Stu, I’m so lonely. When can I see
you?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Good news in that arena. Kelly goes into
rehearsal as of Monday. You know how dedicated she is. By the time she
gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep. We’ll have
both our days and certain nights. Not to mention when they take the show
on the road.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: How long is that for?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Four to five weeks – minimum.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Maybe I should quit my job so we can
be together full time.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Sometimes I think if I have to give
one more fucking manicure…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s how you met me.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: I never saw a worse set of nails. Bit
right down to the quick.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m much better groomed since you’ve been
looking after me.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: I’m glad you admit it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met
her.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: She could care less how you look.
She’s only interested in pushing her own career. Some wife you’re stuck
with!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The marriage is not without its compensations.
Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I’m earning? Not
with everybody cutting back on the publicity. Not to mention a million
college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out. And
one thing you can’t expect from your clients is loyalty. They get a
couple of bad notices, they dump you. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I wasn’t saying goodbye to you. I was saying
how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month’s
notice.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What? Is your watch busted? It’s twenty after
eleven and I’m gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction. So
get out of my face!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sorry, honey. There will be no further
interruption.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Why must you always be calling me from
some booth?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: On account of that phone records are regularly
subpoenaed in divorce proceedings. And I don’t want some entry showing
up on my cellular bill either. She gets the mail. She looks these items
over. Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Then she suspects something.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s only because her last husband, the
choreographer, ran around on her. She can’t get that out of her head.
That’s how she caught onto him. The phone bills.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: She hasn’t developed much skill at
holding a man.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is?
She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me
back to you. I thought I’d feel all guilty about it – but I guess it
hasn’t kicked in yet. Still, I wouldn’t do anything to hurt her.
Basically, Kelly’s a decent individual.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: What about hurting me? Like last
time?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hurt? You were glad to be rid of me.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: For a while I was, ’til I took stock
of what was around. You’re the lesser of many evils.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s about the nicest thing you ever
said.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: I’ll have it engraved.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: We’ve been up front with each other from the
beginning. Let’s keep it that way. How about a drink? Say seven o’clock?
The Monkey Bar?</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Meet me in front. I don’t like walking
in there unescorted.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, you’re great enough looking to be
mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: It happens all the time lately.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And wear that short black number I bought you
from Bendel’s.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Again? I don’t know if it’s me or that
dress you like.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Have a good day. Make plenty of tips. And leave
the whole evening open. She thinks I’ve got Knicks tickets.</p>
<p><strong>columnist</strong>: Speak!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s your boy Stuart. When was the last time I
called you for a favor?</p>
<p><strong>columnist</strong>: The column is already full.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I just need one line. Anybody you wanna say was
seen dining out at Mario’s Stromboli restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>columnist</strong>: Maybe you don’t hear so good? I got no
space for you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who’s asking any favors? I’m offering
reciprocal information.</p>
<p><strong>columnist</strong>: Since when were you ever a reliable
source?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Check it out. Tony award-winning producer
Willie Beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third
attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence
at the San Remo. I got it from the doorman.</p>
<p><strong>columnist</strong>: I got it from their maid yesterday. It’s
in the paper today. Or don’t you bother to read my shit?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Louis, my intentions were entirely
honorable.</p>
<p><strong>columnist</strong>: I’ll drop your item in sometime next
week. If you promise not to call me for a month.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t even think about leaving that
booth.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stay exactly where you are and listen
carefully.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve got a heavy day, mister.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You know better than to disobey me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t know you at all.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you absolutely sure?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Someone who’s watching you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Get lost!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Love the gray suit. That red and black tie
makes a nice combination.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Where? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Closer than you think.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There are any number of windows. Check them
out.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Okay, you had your little joke.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m not sufficiently amused. Not yet. We have
more to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Do me a favor. Call up somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But it’s you I’m interested in. You know how
many people use that booth every day?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why don’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Better than two-hundred people on
average.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Is that what you do? Count them?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What else do I have to do? It’s interesting
watching people. Trying to guess who they are. And what they’re up
to.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What are you – a shut-in of some kind?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You might say that. I can’t go out. I might
be seen.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Somebody’s looking for you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Desperately.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The cops?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The ex-wife. What’d you do – run out on child
support?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What kind of man do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Frankly, I could care less. You had your fun.
Now goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s not in your best interests to hang up on
me. That would make me angry.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Isn’t that just too bad?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: There’s ten million names in the phonebook.
Pester somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I never talk to people I can’t see. I need to
study their reactions.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Alright, bullshit artist, what am I doing right
now?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Scratching your forehead with your left hand.
Now you’re brushing your hair back.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Okay, okay, you got me in your scrutiny. So
what?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: So let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Only I got nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh, you will. You’ll do a lot of talking
before this conversation is over. And it’ll only end when I want it
to.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Is that a fact? Well if you watch closely, you
will see me hang up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t think you will.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I interest you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why should I be interested in some creep who
gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But you’re not a stranger, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who put you up to this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You were my very own selection.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why me in particular?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Because you’re so afraid.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Ha! What’ve I got to be afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Just about everything. You have so much to
hide.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How do you figure that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why else would a man with a perfectly good
cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s my business.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ve made it mine.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: All of a sudden I’m required to give
explanations to you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: In explicit detail.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What is this? Some kind of candid camera gag?
Or like that thing on HBO where the cab driver is taping what goes on in
the back seat?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is not showbusiness, my friend. This is
reality.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Your reality. Not mine, you lowlife fuck.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stu, you’ll be made to suffer for your
attitude, so let’s dispense with the vulgarities.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Now you’re threatening me! Fuck you. Could that
be any clearer?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re only making it easier for me to do you
harm.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh yeah. Right. Can you see how I’m
trembling?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You will be.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Shit, this is a new one. Fucking threatening
calls in a goddam phone booth. When are you going to start with the
heavy breathing.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m not the degenerate. You are, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You don’t know anything about me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Infinitely more than you know about me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Like the number you dialed when you first
entered the booth.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How would you know that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m watching through a scope and I could
clearly read the buttons you pushed. I have another extension here by
the window. Shall I dial that same number back for you? Would that
convince you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Let’s see who’s on the other end of the
line.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Too late. It’s already ringing. I’ll hold the
receiver up so you can listen in.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, hello.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Someone who’s really tight with your
boyfriend – who just called you from his favorite phone booth.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: You know Stu?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stu? Oh, I know him better than anyone. What
he does – how he thinks. How he lies.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Who the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stu is listening in. He knows what we’re both
saying.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Stu? Is that true? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He doesn’t feel like talking.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mavis! Just hang up the goddam phone.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: She can’t hear you, Stu. Only me. Mavis, I’m
afraid Stu hasn’t been totally honest with you. But then he can’t be
honest with anyone, can he?</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: What’s your name? To whom am I
speaking?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ve never heard of me, Mavis. He doesn’t
want you to know I exist. He wishes I didn’t exist. But there isn’t
anything he can do about that. Still there, Stu? All you can do is
listen.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mavis – the guy is a fucking nutcase! Hang the
fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: She doesn’t want to. She wants to know all
about us. Don’t you, Mavis?</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Did his wife put you up to this? That
bitch, Kelly?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly. My very next
call.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He doesn’t know my wife! Don’t tell him
anything else.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Could you hurry it along?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Can you hear me, Mavis? Keep your big mouth
shut.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is that any way to talk to a woman you love?
Mavis, is he always that abusive to you?</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: You’re getting me all upset. I don’t
know who you are or how you know all this –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I find out things – from watching people and
listening to them.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Just what is your relationship to Stu?
That’s all I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: Answer me, goddam it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well alright. Stu and I are – longtime
companions. A pair. Two of a kind. Closer than close. Peas in a pod.
Spoons in a drawer.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: You pervert!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That, too.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Don’t believe a word of it. It’s all lies.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Too late, Stu. She already believes it.</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: You can tell that scumbag never to
bother me again.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He won’t care. He’ll still have me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s not true. I do care.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Get done in there, mister. I got me an
important call.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Shit I will! Finish up!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why don’t you tell me what you think of
us?</p>
<p><strong>mavis’ voice</strong>: You’re both disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s what he said about you. Well, if Stu
didn’t have the balls to come out and tell you the truth, I felt it was
my responsibility to clear the air. Goodbye now, Mavis. Thanks for your
time. Back to you again, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You total asshole! How could you do that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Speaking of females, that woman hovering
outside the booth – may as well tell her that you’ll be on the line
forever.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Like hell I will.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m ready for you to take out your cellular
and phone home. And this time, I’ll listen in.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: There’s no chance of that.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Or should I call Kelly and make up something
totally outrageous? You must realize by now I have a vivid
imagination.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You don’t know our phone number!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you absolutely sure? I may have been
watching you on a regular basis. Keeping track of all the numbers I see
you dial.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And I’m supposed to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ve put a great deal of preparation into
this – prior to actually saying hello. Now do you want to dial 832-7165
– or should</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What are you going to tell her?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ll do the talking.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What am I supposed to say?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Try telling her the truth.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Look, I don’t want to hurt Kelly. She’s always
there for me. It’s just my nature to have a little ‘strange’ on the
side. It doesn’t mean shit.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But you still find it necessary?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Kind of like having a beautiful home. With
everything you ever dreamed of. But you still need that vacation now and
then. Some nice hotel room with a great view. Maybe a pool. Only you
wouldn’t want to spend more than a few days in any hotel. Eventually,
you want to go back to your home and all your stuff. You’re real glad to
check out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? I’m sure
they’ll both appreciate that explanation.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re ruining my fucking life, you
sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Didn’t I warn you about calling me names? It
makes me vindictive.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What else can you do to me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We haven’t even begun.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She’s not home. She went out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ll bet she’s back. Now hold the cellular up
where I can see it – so I can be certain you don’t misdial on me. A
little higher and to your left. Now I have it in perfect view. Dial
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: If you got you a cell phone, how come you
taking up the whole fucking booth! This here’s an emergency!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: There’s another booth on the next block.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: It’s busted. Every damn phone on Eighth
Avenue is busted but this one.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Well, I’m not through! Go in a restaurant or
someplace, but get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: I’m gonna pull you out of that booth and
snatch you ballheaded!</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: You assaulted my person.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Let me hear from your lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: You’re hear alright. I’m coming back. And
your ass better not be around.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Good work, Stu. Now let me see you dial. Tuck
the receiver under your chin and dial your remote.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m doing it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I told you she was out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Let it ring.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Shepard residence.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hold it close to the receiver so I can
hear.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Honey, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: What’s taking you so long? I thought
we were having some lunch at Mario’s?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Change of plan. We’re not eating in that dump
any more.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The Health Department gave them a ‘C’ rating –
that’s how come. Here I’m trying to put the place on the map and he
fucks it all up with a major roach problem.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: That’s disgusting. Okay, I’ll fix us
a sandwich. Where are you now?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Just in a phone booth.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: How come? The caller ID says you’re
on your cellular.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh yeah, I am.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: But you’re also in some phone
booth?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Explain that one, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I only stepped in because the traffic was so
loud outside.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Well just hurry on back.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tell her you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Not for a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Are you sure you’re alone? I hear
somebody in the background.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The guy in the next booth. He’s got a bad
connection and he’s hollering his fool head off.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ve got an answer for everything.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I love you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You know that.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Stu – who was that man?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What man?</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Some person who phoned fifteen
minutes ago – just after you went out.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: This total stranger rang up and told
me to wait by the phone – because you’d be calling me in a few minutes –
from a booth. And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And what did this guy say?</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: He said you’d be making phone calls.
What else?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Making calls is part of my business.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: To whom?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Clients. People. Planting items like I do.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Women?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Once in a while one of them could be a woman. I
just called “Elaine’s” and talked to her to see who was in there last
night.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: You know exactly what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re not going to start that shit again?</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: I just feel something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What could be wrong?</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: The way you sound. You don’t sound
like yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah? Who do I sound like?</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: Someone who’s scared. There’s fear in
your voice like I’ve never heard before.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: See, Stu? Kelly agrees with me.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: I want you to come back home.
Now!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I told you. In a while.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: No. I want you here now. In case he
calls back, I don’t want to answer again.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why should he call back?</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: I feel like he’s going to.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re the one that sounds frightened. And of
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: He’s not a nobody. He knows about
us.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re not telling me all he said. What are you
holding back?</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: I can’t discuss it on the phone. Just
get over here!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why did you do that to her? She never did you
any harm.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How would you know? Everybody does harm to
somebody. And then they try their best to forget it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Maybe me – but not her. Whatever I’ve done,
there’s no reason to take it out on her.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Suppose that’s the only way I can get to you?
You claim you love her.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah, I do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You don’t even love yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: But Kelly… I would never hurt.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Still you have to uphold your status as an
honorary asshole.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Listen, I’ve treated all my women decent. I
never laid a hand on any of them, even when provoked. And I always let
them down easy. I’m not ready to let Kelly go. Maybe I never will
be.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What if she dumps you first? What’s the odds
she’s already taken up with somebody? One day soon you’ll come home and
find her gone along with the CD player and the</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not gonna let you mind-fuck me all day!
That’s it. This call is ended.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not until I say it is.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What happens if I hang up?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You don’t really want to find out.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m dying to hear this!!! What the fuck can you
do about it – up in your fucking high window with your goddam
binoculars?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I never indicated I had binoculars. I said I
had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that brought you up so
close I could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh – while you’re at it, have a look up my
ass.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I may very well do that, Stu. In the
meantime, think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted
on it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What? You mean… like a rifle?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A high-powered .30 calibre bolt action
Remington 700 with a carbon one modification and a state of the art
Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. And you’re in the cross hairs, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m supposed to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There’s only one way I can prove it to you.
Hang up the receiver and find out. At this range, the exit wound ought
to be about the size of a small tangerine.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And you’re just going to kill me for no
reason?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For plenty of reasons! Because you hung up.
For years I hated people hanging up on me. Ex-girlfriends. Women I
didn’t even know. Prospective employers.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I get hung up on all the time. You get used to
it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Or else you don’t. I worked for months
getting people to switch to MCI – being insulted at and being hung up on
hundreds of times a day. The ones that cursed me out for invading their
privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even
bothering to reply.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Then why didn’t you go after one of them?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Maybe you are one of them.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, I have worked in a boiler room myself
peddling “Term Life.” I Would never be rude to a fellow salesperson.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Can you feel it on you now? The heat of it.
I’m moving the strike zone down to your stomach area. Now I’m raising it
up again. Directly above the chest cavity – sliding up to the forehead
just above the left ear.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Shit – I do feel it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tell me where I’m going with it now.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Across my forehead – now back where it was
before.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m amazed how you can do that. You’re
amazingly accurate. Now I know what you’re thinking. If I drop down on
the floor of the booth and flatten myself out…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No, I’m not thinking that.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh yes you are. Can I crawl out using the
booth as a shield? Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only
three or four feet away? The shattering glass may cut me, but it’ll only
be superficial. Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. You will. I know you will. If I just
cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where is it now? Think and feel for the warm
spot.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Below the shoulder?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The right shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Remarkable how we’re in tune. You’re doing
far better than the others.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What others? What do you mean? You said
‘others!’</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m sure you read about the Italian tourist
shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I saw it on the news.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: And where are we now?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh, God. Forty-fifth and Eighth.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What else do you remember about that
killing?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Try.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He was gunned down. And nobody was caught. And
they didn’t even bother to take his wallet or his watch… or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now you know why. It wasn’t a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He hung up – so I disconnected him
permanently.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Please – don’t do it to me. You got no reason
to do it to me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t give me reason.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not looking to. Tell me what you want!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tell me about your job.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What’s to tell? I’m in Public Relations. They
used to call us “flacks.” Now we’re media consultants.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What do you do, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Plant items in the paper and on the tube. More
important sometimes, keep stuff out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’ve you kept out?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: One of my people got nailed for indecent
exposure. I managed for the cops to use his real name instead of his
stage name so nobody picked up on it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You saved the little deviate’s ass, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He’s in major therapy now. I swear he is.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You must hang with some major celebrities.
Journalists, newscasters – those types.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m real close with Larry King. And the “Hard
Copy” people.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Could you get him down here? Larry King?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why would he want to come here?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Because you asked him to.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He comes from Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, who could you get?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wolf Blitzer?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Regis?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Definitely no chance.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’d be offering them an exclusive
newsbreak. I’m talking about more than one homicide.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t answer questions. I ask them.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I gotta have the facts. They might not believe
me. My record isn’t too good when it comes to hard news.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re not considered a reliable source?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: On a divorce or separation, maybe. Or who’s
gay, or who isn’t gay any more. I kind of specialize in that kind of
material. I mean I could probably get you Joe Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How about Cindy Adams?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I might have a shot. Are you familiar with Liz
Smith?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do you know her number?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Want I should call her? How much can I say?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tell her you’re in direct touch with a killer
who’s willing to speak honestly if she shows up here alone and without
notifying the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She usually likes to have a celebrity involved.
If you had an actor or a sports figure held prisoner instead of me,
there’d be better odds she’s come.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then lie. Pick a celebrity and put them in
the booth.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Let’s see. Who does she like? Who couldn’t be
reached to deny it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m anxious to see you in action. Don’t keep
me waiting.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sometimes you only get her service. Hi – Stu
Shepard. Put me through. I’ve got hard news for her. I can only talk to
her directly. But say it regards – Liza.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Liza? That was imaginative.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No, I can’t call back. I’ll have to lay in on
somebody else. Alright, but I can’t hang on long. She’s coming on. Liz,
hello. Sure I’ll make it brief. Killing two weeks ago in the theatre
district? Turn out a sniper did the job. Yeah, a sniper with a rifle.
Now he’s got another victim lined up. Not just your anonymous New
Yorker, but Liza. Now you can’t call anybody or Ms. Minelli’s dead meat
and so am I. She’s hostage in a phone booth right in the sniper’s
sights. But he says he’ll talk to you and let her walk. I know it’ll
take balls to do this, but you’re a fine and courageous newspaper
woman…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hello? Hello? Either she’s on her way over or
she doesn’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You weren’t particularly convincing.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I didn’t really believe in what I was
saying.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Because you don’t really believe my Remington
is pointed at you?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re ninety percent sure.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: At least ninety-five percent, easy.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Let me erase all doubt.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. Don’t shoot.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Control yourself, Stu. Glance down at your
chest. What do you see.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh, my God. A dot. A fucking red dot.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Like you’ve seen in the movies?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The laser dot. Just before some poor bastard
always gets blown away.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Usually a supporting player. That lovely but
by now generic special effect of the bullet piercing the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This takes all the guesswork out of it. You
know exactly where to expect it before I even tighten my finger on the
trigger.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Don’t tighten. Don’t even tickle that fucking
finger.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How about Geraldo? He’s run his ass off to
get in on this.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re talking about the old Geraldo. Look, I
can try and reach cable NBC. They’re hungry.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m disappointed. I wanted to go first
class.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They do a great job. They’ll haul a whole crew
over to cover your surrender “live.”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I never expressed interest in giving myself
up. There are so many other phone booths in the city. I’m just getting
warmed up.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s entirely up to you. Your choice. I’m
just trying to set you up with the proper communicator. I suppose Liza
wasn’t strong enough. I should’ve said Madonna.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now you’re being creative.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Drag your baggy butt out of that booth. We got
business to conduct out of there.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: He been in there all day.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not through.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hang up that receiver or I’ll make you eat the
fucking thing!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Fuck off or I’ll call a cop.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Do you see one around here? What you think I’m
gonna be doing while you’re waiting for a prowl car to get assigned? I’m
about to cut you a second asshole if you don’t vacate those
premises.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: He’s got him a fucking cellular. What’s he
need to be on our booth for?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t explain it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m not interested in your explanations even
if you had any.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: If I flick this, I use it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ll make it worth your while to go away. How
much do you want?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Make me an offer.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Thirty dollars. It’s all I’ve got in cash. Take
it and go.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’re offering to rent my phone booth? For
how long?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t know. For as long as it takes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s so special in there?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Do you want the money?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Is that a genuine Rolex you’ve got on?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Come on, man. That’s my good watch.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s what it’s gonna take.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Then here. Take the damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And the thirty!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Take it all.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now I’m satisfied. But you still got to deal
with Felicia here. I believe you spoke harshly to her.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And did her some injury.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: An accident. I’m sorry about that, too.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: The man don’t sound like he means it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I agree. Why don’t you hang up a minute so we
can discuss this matter at length.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s long distance. I can’t lose the call – I
might not get them back.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Do I have to rip that fucking phone out of
there?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That wouldn’t be a good idea. Would it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I gave you everything I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That pinky ring looks attractive. Felicia
might like that.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: It might fit.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You want the ring, you’ve got the ring. If I
can get it off.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I can get it off you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Let go of me! It’s coming loose. There. Okay,
Felicia, with my deepest apologies. Goodbye now.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s really going on in that booth – that
escapes the naked eye?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Nothing. Talk. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That your connection on the end of the line?
Or are you dealing?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This has nothing to do with drugs.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You gotta be high on something to willingly
divest yourself of your valuables – just to maintain occupancy of a
fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I knew it smelled for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You look like you’re ready to piss
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Because I am.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Maybe if the city provided decent public
toilets, folks wouldn’t relieve themselves in the subway stations and
phone booths!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ll take it up with the mayor.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Next thing you know you’re gonna claim we
mugged you – took your billfold and watch.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No, you didn’t. It was a fair and equitable
deal. You had territorial rights to this booth and I paid a license fee.
Fair is fair. Now leave me in peace.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You sure you’re alright? He don’t look
well.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Kind of pale. Even for a white man.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Jaundice they calls it. Probably advanced
liver trouble. If it’s cirrhosis, you better find yourself a twelve step
program and quick.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Thanks for your interest but I’m in perfect
health.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: So how come his hand is shaking?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: The man is cracking up.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Lookit the sweat pouring off the
sonofabitch. That’s one sick mother you started up with, Leon!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Me? You’re the one that brought me over and
exposed me to all his germs.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m terminal, okay? Now can I close the booth
and continue my conversation?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m worried now it might be catching. All that
money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and
incurable disease.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Fine. Give it back.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What good’s that? We done touched it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Well go wash your hands.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Come on now. Own up to what you’re carrying.
Is it some of that sexually transmitted shit? Cause in that case, we can
relax.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m sick of you. Now get out of my face.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Here we’s being solicitous as to your health
and you respond by heaping abuse!</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Whip his arrogant ass.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Touch me and I’ll throw up on you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You can see what I’m up against here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Want me to get rid of him for you?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: God – no. Don’t. It’s not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You asked for my help.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ll handle it myself.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re not doing too well. I can settle it in
a fraction of a second. Shall I demonstrate?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. For your own safety, mister, just walk
away.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now the man is turning aggressive… issuing
threats upon my person.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re making this happen.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: If you don’t hang up and step out, I’m about
to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This isn’t my fault. Stop that!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The guy’s insane!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Only one way to stop a mad dog. Give me
permission.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If he forces you out of that booth, I’ve told
you what to expect. You or him, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Don’t cut yourself, honey.</p>
<p><strong>derelict</strong>: Looks like the fucker is comin’ loose.</p>
<p><strong>street person</strong>: Shove it out into the oncoming
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>derelict</strong>: What’ll you bet the bus could knock that
fifty feet?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re breaking up. We’re about to be cut
off.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t help it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That counts as a hang-up.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. It can’t. That’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can still make him stop. Say the word. Can
you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You did it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You said ‘yes.’</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I said ‘Yes, I can hear you.’ Not ‘Yes – kill
the motherfucker!’</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t try to renege on it. I was following
orders.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re twisting it all around. I didn’t do
this!</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: I warned you not to cut yourself. Look at
all that blood. He must’ve hit an artery.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Oh, Jesus. What is that? Talk to me! What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>derelict</strong>: Gunshot!</p>
<p><strong>street person</strong>: Yeah. Sucking chest wound right over
the heart.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Somebody call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>street person</strong>: Call the meatwagon. He’s fucked
up.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: You shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Why did you do that to him?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: You all saw it! He shot my man without no
provocation!</p>
<p><strong>derelict</strong>: Yeah. Pumped one right into him at close
range.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How could I? I don’t even have a gun. Look!</p>
<p><strong>street person</strong>: Everybody get the fuck back! They
shoot one – then they shoot everybody in sight! Kill all the fucking
witnesses!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Come back. You’ve got to see – I’m not
armed.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Hang up and dial 911. Get a doctor!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t hang up. That’s what this is all
about.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: You’re gonna stand there and let him
die?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can use this. Emergency. Yes. There’s been a
shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth – on the corner. A man is down.
What’s the difference who I am? I don’t want to be involved.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: That’s bullshit. He’s the shooter. You’re
talking to the shooter.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That wasn’t nice.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Go ahead – make a fucking run for it. I
hope they gun you down – like you did him!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not going anyplace. I’m staying right here
in this booth. Unless you give me permission.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re attracting a lot of attention. I
suppose when the police get there, you’ll accuse me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What do you expect me to say?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s up to you. But any mention of me will
not be appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You mean…?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You won’t even get to finish your sentence.
Oh look, that little red dot is dancing around all over you again. You
saw how quickly it can happen. And how accurate I can be.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They can’t blame me – I’m not armed.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who’s going to believe that? With all those
witnesses to the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They can see with their own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Remember to leave me out of it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How can I?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ll put the proper spin on it. Isn’t that
your specialty? Feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of
truth – and making it totally believable?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This isn’t a story. This is real. This is
murder.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If you’d only dealt with the man reasonably,
shown him some respect, this might not have been necessary.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I gave him my money, my watch…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But not your respect. Which is what he
required of you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He was a fucking thief.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: And now he’s a fucking dead thief. Do you
feel better about that?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t feel a bit guilty. This is all your
doing!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now you’re being disrespectful of me. You
never learn. Your job is to deal with people – but you’re not good at
it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey, I’m not taking any more criticism from
some lunatic sniper who gets his kicks killing strangers.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You keep insisting I’m a stranger. Probably
because you don’t recognize the voice. But there are cheap electronic
devices available that disguise the voice. I might not even be a man. I
might be one of those many women you’ve almost totally forgotten. One
who doesn’t forgive easily. One who wants to watch you squirm.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’re a man. I know you’re a man. Women don’t
kill with telescopic rifles. They stab you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You sound so sure of that. But you’ve never
provoked any man as much as have the women in your life. And so many of
them, Stu. Do you even remember their names?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve got no time to rehash my whole life. Oh my
God! The cops are here.</p>
<p><strong>production note</strong>: Everything is seen from Stu’s
perspective without intercuts.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: That’s him – in the booth. He’s got a
gun!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Throw down your weapon and come out with
your hands raised.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They’re ordering me to come out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can see that. Ignore them.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What if they open fire?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They probably won’t. Look across on the east
side of the street. Do you see the tourist with the home video
camera?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’s going to keep the police on their best
behavior. So long as you don’t take what could be interpreted as hostile
action, you’ll be safe.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You call this safe? Six cops with guns pointed
my way?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You want me to reduce them to three – or
two?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Absolutely no more shooting. Now is that
clear?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You can always change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You know the drill. Hands clasped behind
the back of your neck – moving slowly – step out of the booth. If we see
any sign of a weapon, we will respond.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You won’t, because there isn’t any.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I repeat. Raise your hands.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t. I’m on a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>captain ramey</strong>: You have thirty seconds to
comply.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I told you. I’m busy. Come back later.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Very good, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: You’ve been given an order.</p>
<p><strong>production note</strong>: We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops
– always from Stu’s POV. But we can hear their voices and all that is
said as if they were in close up. It has an odd, unreal and distancing
effect.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: We’re dealing with a mental case. He’s
looking for us to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Well he’s not getting his wish.</p>
<p><strong>felicia</strong>: Tell me he’s gonna be alright.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Step aside. Let us look at him.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Nothing we can do. Don’t touch the body.
They’ll need it to mark the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Same corner as two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Maybe it’s more than a coincidence. Cover me.
I need to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: You’ve got your vest on?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: I’m not armed.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Yeah, sure. I need to know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Can’t talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Sure you can. My name’s Ramey. Captain Ed
Ramey. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Look, I don’t want to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: You look like you need a friend.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tell him you’ve already got a friend.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve got a friend, okay.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Is that who you’re talking to on the
phone?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: When somebody gets shot, it becomes my
business. Let’s not have anybody else killed. I want to hear your side
of it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve got no side of it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t worry, Stu. I’ve got him fixed right in
my sights. I won’t let him hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Has this happened to you before? The need to
hurt someone? To put a bullet in them?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You won’t believe anything I say.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I couldn’t shoot anybody. I’m not armed.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: You’re right. I don’t believe you. What’s
that bulge in your pants pocket?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That? That’s my cellular.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: A cellular? Then what are you doing in a
phone booth making calls?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Do you want to see it?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Don’t reach for it, mister.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Then how can I show it to you?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: I don’t need to see it. I know what’s there.
All these witnesses saw you use it on him.</p>
<p><strong>street person</strong>: Damn straight!</p>
<p><strong>derelict</strong>: Yeah! Shot him down like a dog!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They’re all lying. Nobody saw it because it
didn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: A man is dead but it didn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Not on account of me! This is like some bad
dream.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: You’re walking through a bad dream and you
can’t wake up. Do you want to wake up?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: And in this dream, you killed that man. He
was bothering you so you iced him.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Then who did?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t tell him, Stu. Or it’ll be the last
thing he ever hears. His blood will be on your hands.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: But you saw it happen?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: You were the closest one to him. You must’ve
seen who did it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: We’re trying to be honest with each other,
aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m losing patience with this cop.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m handling this.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Who do you keep talking to on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Nobody. My psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Excellent, Stu. You’re getting good at
this.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: What’s this doctor’s name? It’s important we
know.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: He says not to tell you. It’s privileged
information.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Damn good reply. Now you’re having fun. Admit
it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Playing it so close to the edge. I’ll bet
you’ve never felt so alive. That’s how I feel when I look through the
sight and select somebody.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: I respect your right to privacy. I’ve been to
therapy myself. The department provides it. I know it’s not good form
for a cop to be admitting that, but…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tell him not to come any closer.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Stop right there. Back up a few steps. Back
where you were.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: If it makes you more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tell him to read you your rights.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I want you to read me my rights and stop asking
questions.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Al least tell me your first name.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s my right not to have any name.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: No gun and no name. You’re a highly
underprivileged person.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Demand a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And get me a lawyer, too. I want a lawyer
brought down here to negotiate my surrender.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Brilliant, Stu. Keep winging it.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: It’ll be hard to find a lawyer willing to
risk his life. But if you hand over the gun…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How can I when you won’t let me take it
out?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: We’ll take it out for you – as soon as you
exit the booth with your hands raised and…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Now we’re back to that again. It’s always “Get
out of the booth.’ ‘You can’t stay in the booth.’ Well, I like it in the
fucking booth. It’s my whole world now. It’s my booth and I’m never
coming out.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: We’re not about to force you because there
could be a miscalculation and then we’d never find out why this
happened.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why is it so important to know? The guy is
dead. Isn’t that enough? Knowing isn’t going to make him alive again. So
who gives a fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: It’s what makes the job interesting. Finding
out why. Something drove you to do this. You didn’t go out today
expecting this to happen. It was a nice day. You were out for a walk.
And then suddenly it all changed.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: All I wanted was to make a phone call. One
lousy phone call for thirty-five fucking cents.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Careful, Stu. Don’t volunteer too much.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: You got some bad news on that call.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The worst.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Something that pushed you over the edge?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And I’ve been falling ever since.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Time to land.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: When you hit bottom, you die.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: I’m your safety net.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: If I tell you what you want to know – you’ll
die, too.</p>
<p><strong>production note</strong>: The only time we deviate from Stu’s
perspective is when we see the sniper’s POV through his scope.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: I’ll go see about that lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Now that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’s lucky. I had him centered in my cross
hairs. I really had to restrain myself.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s not the police. It’s the media. You’re
news, Stuart.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ve never gotten this much press for any
of your clients. I’m making you a famous person.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They’re just hoping for coverage of me dying in
the gutter.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Their presence is putting the police on their
continued best behavior.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Those cops are just looking for any excuse.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then don’t give them one.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who could it be?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Kelly. She was worried about me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Maybe she’s seen this on television. It must
be on every channel by now. Breaking news.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She doesn’t watch daytime TV.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One of the neighbors could’ve alerted
her.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why are you saying this? You want me to reach
in my pocket so you can see them open fire?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s an unwarranted accusation and very
unbecoming in light of the good advice I’ve given in the past. Have I
ever steered you wrong?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: God – how I’d love to hear her voice.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It might even be worth it. She’s insistent,
isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: If she knows I’m in trouble, she won’t give
up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Probably glued to the TV by now. I’m watching
coverage on two stations now. Channel surfing. Well, there you are on
two and four and five. Not any decent angles on you, though, stuck
inside there.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But if you’d take one or two steps outside
and look up, I think they could get a clear picture of you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You said I’m not allowed to leave the
booth.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I might be willing to bend the rules and let
you enjoy your moment of fame. Set the phone down without hanging up…
and take a step or two outside. Just for a minute. Then come straight
back in or I’ll be forced to provide ‘live’ coverage that should rival
the historic Zapruder footage. Nothing like an exploding head to excite
viewer interest.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No, thanks. I’ll stay where I am.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It was only a suggestion. Since you’re
convinced I’m going to plug you anyway, it can’t matter much.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: If you shoot me, you give yourself away.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Even without a muffler, they’d never hear the
report with all this noise. Afterwards, it’d take them a good ten
minutes to realize you weren’t plugged by some overzealous officer. Then
they’ll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down
here and do the SWAT team’s job for them.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You expected them to come. You had this all
worked out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I write the scenario and you all play your
parts – as directed.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Poor Kelly. What she must be going through.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why don’t you tell her how you feel about
her?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’d never get the words out. Not with fifteen
or twenty rounds in me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You can’t be certain they’d fire. They’d see
it was only a phone.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: They wouldn’t wait to see.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why doesn’t she hang up?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s her! She’s not calling me. She’s over
there.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is she?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: The blonde girl in the green jacket.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Can’t miss her. Very attractive, isn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: She must’ve heard all the commotion and come
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s somebody else who knows my cell number.
It’s you!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You continue to impress.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why is it so important that they kill me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Because that’s how I win.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This time you won’t. If you want me dead,
you’ll have to do it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Either way I can’t lose.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s all a game to you – because you’re
incapable of feelings. You’re not even human.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I pride myself on that. What’s so great about
being human? It’s the lowest form of life on this planet and I’ve taken
it upon myself to thin the herd.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I quit. I’m not answering back any more. I
won’t hang up but I’m not playing.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stu? Stu, don’t be that way. You’re taking
the pleasure out of it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: This here’s Helfand, of New York
Telephone.</p>
<p><strong>helfand</strong>: Glad to help out.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Have you got the number of that booth?</p>
<p><strong>helfand</strong>: Sure do.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Can you tap into that call?</p>
<p><strong>helfand</strong>: It can be done.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: But not without a warrant. You could be
violating this psycho’s civil rights. Especially if he’s on the line
with his fucking psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Shit. I don’t want to blow this on a
technicality. Tracing the call isn’t any violation, is it?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: As long as we don’t listen in.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Okay, we’ve got to know who he’s talking to
and their current location.</p>
<p><strong>helfand</strong>: That I can handle. As long as they keep the
circuit open.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: I need the number and an address to go with
it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stuart, my friend. Do you want to see how
close I can come without actually hitting you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: May I call attention to the yellow pages?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hollow points are designed to break up on
impact. It would’ve behaved differently if it had pierced your soft
flesh. The pieces would’ve bounced around looking for a way out. That’s
where the real damage occurs – finding an exit – deflecting off all that
bone…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Still the silent treatment? My father used to
dish that out when he chose to punish me. Not a word spoken – one time
for over a month. I’d try and goad him to acknowledge I existed, but he
stared right through me. You’re bringing back unhappy childhood, Stu.
That’s not wise.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Since you’re ignoring me, I’ll focus on
someone else. There she is – nice and sharp. I can see the two little
punctures in each earlobe and my God, what kind of a girl would have her
nostril pierced?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What was that? Louder, Stu. We must have a
bad connection.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Leave her out of it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I didn’t expect her to show up here. But
since she has – I’ll improvise.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Don’t. Please don’t. I’m sorry. I’m talking to
you again. I’ll talk all you want!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s a bad dye job. The black roots are
growing in and it makes her look cheap.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve screwed up her life enough already. Please
don’t hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t necessarily have to kill her. I could
be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation. Which part of her
displeases you most? If she turns a bit more in profile, I’m accurate
enough to remove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose. It’s just
cartilage. Any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking better than
ever.</p>
<p><strong>production note</strong>: The only time we deviate from Stu
and his POV is when we see the sniper’s own POV through his telescopic
sight.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You can see her talking to the police now.
She’s identifying herself as your wife. They’re very interested in who
you are. They’re taking her over to see the officer in charge. What was
his name?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: What do you mean psychiatrist? He doesn’t see
any psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Then who’d your husband be talking to?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: There was some guy that called the house this
morning and said weird stuff to me.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Stu seems to be checking things out with this
person.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: He hasn’t got many friends – I can tell you
that.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Remain here, please. We may need you
later.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You won’t hurt him?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: We’ll do our best not to.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: She won’t even feel it when it happens.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Take me instead.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t distract me. Now’s the time to be
absolutely still. I have to hold my breath as I squeeze gently –</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No! I’m hanging up. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Shit. He hung up.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Maybe they already traced it. Anyhow, it
doesn’t matter. Looks like he’s coming out.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ve giving myself up. Take me!</p>
<p><strong>swat officer</strong>: First the gun. We want to see you toss
away your weapon!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Shit. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>swat officer</strong>: Freeze where you are! Turn around and
keep those hands clasped. Take him.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What is going on with these fucking phone
calls?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Hold your fire. Let him answer it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Let them talk. He’s not going anywhere. He’s
going back inside the booth.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You got the wrong number. Hang up.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wrong number. Wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Aw, relax, Stu. Only yanking your chain. Now
can we start over?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Those cops won’t wait much longer.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What else can they do? They can’t afford to
just shoot you like I can. Not with so much media coverage. Not unless
you make some stupid aggressive move. The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled
up.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Will you look at that? I must be going out over
the network. Bet they’re pre-empting usual programming.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: And just think – if you survive this, your
trial will be televised. And you can try and make the world believe I
ever existed. I’d be your only defense.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: How are they gonna prove that I killed anybody
when there’s no gun?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They’ll plant one. The police aren’t above
that – when they’re desperate to convict.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No, sir. No gun and I walk.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t you think I took that into account? Am
I a fool?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Haven’t I considered every eventuality? I
knew they’d come and cordon off the block. And that there’d have to be a
gun someplace.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s a small booth, Stu. Have you checked
every inch of it?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s not on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then what’s left?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Up above.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Could be. Why don’t you reach up there and
lift the plastic sheet – and feel around.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: If they see me reach for something, they could
open fire.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They could. But you have to know if it’s
there. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I totally don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: In a narrow space, tucked just to the left of
the fluorescent bulb. You can almost see it outlined if you look
closely.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It doesn’t matter. I know about ballistics. The
slug in that dead guy came from your rifle, not any handgun.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You saw how hollow points splinter on impact.
There’s nothing much for ballistics to match to. The same make .30
calibre bullets are in that handgun. The prosecution rests.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: There’s no gun up there. I don’t see a damn
thing.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Slide your finger up under the plastic and
you’ll feel the cold metal surface. There are four rounds left in it.
Should you decide to shoot your way out.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I could never shoot anybody.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You could shoot me, Stu. You’d do that in a
minute if you could.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: And I’d fucking love it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now you’re speaking from the heart. Come on,
just lift the partition a few inches and feel what’s there for you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not getting my fingerprints on your fucking
weapon. What about powder residue? How are they going to explain that to
a jury?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do you think that’ll matter with so many eye
witnesses? Do it… or should I re-focus my attention on Kelly?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You carefully distracted me from her before
and I let you get away with it. But if you’re not going to play fairly –
There she is again. So close I feel like I could touch her.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Get off her!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then mind me when I speak.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Look! I’m reaching up with my left hand. I’m
pushing against the partition. It’s giving. I’m feeling around with my
fingertips. It’s filthy up there.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m – touching something.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One of the finest handguns Remington makes.
Lightweight, efficient and highly accurate.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not picking it up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not right now. But eventually…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I wouldn’t have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I never said you would.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m not insane.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But you’re getting there. It wouldn’t take
much.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That won’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You could pull the gun down, shove it in your
own mouth and jerk the trigger. That’s another option.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: To please me. And ensure that nothing happens
to Kelly. I don’t necessarily have to deal with her today in the midst
of a crowd of cops. I can take her out any time I like. When she goes to
pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in
the morning. What is it – a Jack Russell?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Okay. I know you can do it. But don’t talk
about that. Please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’d rather see you remembered as the gallant
gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police – than as a
coward who sucked the barrel. I’m doing your PR for you. Creating a
final image that’ll endure. The outraged New Yorker who was pushed too
far. When some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory, he
retaliated. And when the forces of the law closed in, he was defiant… to
the end.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Like that nerdy sonofabitch who blew those
three wiseass kids away on the subway?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Exactly. Nobody minded that he was a sicko.
He was living out a New Yorker’s pet fantasy. Can you remember that
movie where Peter Finch started screaming ‘I’m not taking it anymore!’
And everybody picked up on it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: ‘I’m mad as hell and I’m not taking it
anymore.’</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That was it. Poor Finch got himself an Oscar
for that. But he was dead by then. I mean he really died. Maybe playing
that part took too much out of him.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: ‘I’m not taking it anymore.’ ‘I’m not taking it
anymore.’</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s the way! Psyche yourself up. Everybody
respects a man who fights back, even if he goes a little berserk in the
process.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Fighting back. That’s what it’s about.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Exactly! We all understand the poor schmuck
that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses. We all
thought of doing that. But only he had the balls. The terminally ill
husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance
company offices. Maybe somebody will finally get the message. You can
fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you.
I’m still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned. I could relieve
all that anguish in a fraction of a second. Shall I?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m on my knees begging you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stand up, Stu. You’re embarrassing
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stu – I want you back on your feet facing me.
So you can see what I’m going to do to her.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Be a man, Stuart. Don’t let them see you like
this. You’re an embarrassment to me.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Officer on east side of the street reports
subject removed a dark metallic object from his pocket. We better
move.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Hold all fire until you actually identify a
weapon. We’re doing this on fucking TV!</p>
<p><strong>emergency operator</strong>: Police. Is this an emergency?
Hello? Is someone on the line?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’ve made your point. Who’s going to believe
I’ve got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in a fucking phone
booth at 45th and 8th?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It took you a while to believe it
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: If you’d put a bullet in that Captain Ramey, it
would’ve been a different story – but you were too wise to do that.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why don’t you do it for me? Wave the old
captain back over and get him nice and close and then use the handgun on
him.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Why me? You could pick off any of those cops
from your window up there. Like you did that pimp. And that tourist last
week. But this time you want me to do your killing for you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: And you will! To save Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>emergency operator</strong>: Can you speak up, sir? What is
your name?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s better, Stu. Now turn around so I can
see you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: This booth. It’s my whole world – shrunk down
to four feet by three feet. Not much bigger than the size of a
coffin.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They can put handles on the booth and bury
you in it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: When I saw you put that bullet into that black
dude, I knew you’d never let me out of this phone booth alive.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re wasting my time. Reach up and take the
gun.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Let me see you first. What harm can that do
you? You’re in one of those windows. I’ve got to know which one.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No need for that.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Being so far, I could never identify you. I
don’t even want to.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What is it then?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Don’t worry that I’d try to point you out.
You’d shut me up with one of your .30 calibre hollow points before I
could even raise a finger.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why does it matter so much?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I want to see that you exist. Like God exists.
It’s not enough to believe. You want to see him – just once – even at a
distance.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: And then you’d take the gun down. And use it.
We have a deal on that?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Show yourself to me and I’ll take the gun down.
I swear.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t have to make deals. And you’re
irritating me by trying to negotiate. God doesn’t have to prove
anything. He just strikes you down when he gets in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Stop! I won’t ask to see you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m glad that’s settled. But look who else
has showed up?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I guess she saw the coverage on TV and just
couldn’t keep away.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The ‘hotel’ just arrived. And a very
beautiful little hotel she is. Actually, I’d classify her as more of a
motel.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mavis? I don’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: She’s too far back behind the police line.
But I’ve got a fine shot at her from up here.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You don’t even know what she looks like.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re in an enviable position now, Stu. You
get to choose between them. Tell me which one.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Which will it be? Kelly or Mavis? Or should I
simply select one?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I need time to think…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’ve got to be more in touch with your
feelings. You said you love Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then I’m doing you a favor putting you out of
the way of temptation.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It wasn’t Mavis’ fault. It was all my
fault.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then take the third option. Reach above you
and pick up the gun.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You’ll leave them both alone?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: There won’t be much point in harming them
without you around to impress.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Let me see you do it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I need one minute. One last minute, please. Can
you give me that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re going to say your
prayers?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: They should’ve traced the fucking call by
now.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: There’s something else coming in. A 911
operator says your name was mentioned by somebody that’s still on the
line. Somebody talking about a phone booth. And a sniper.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Patch me through. Hello, this is Captain
Edward Ramey. What about that call?</p>
<p><strong>emergency operator</strong>: The line is still open. It’s
originating from a booth at 45th and 8th.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: We’re there! Can you play me back your
recording of the entire call?</p>
<p><strong>emergency operator</strong>: I can’t replay the tape while
it’s still running.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Then switch to another machine and play back
what you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>emergency operator</strong>: It’s awful faint. He’s not
talking directly into the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>stu’s voice</strong>: ‘Who’s going to believe I’ve got a
sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in some fucking phone
booth…’</p>
<p><strong>telephone technician</strong>: Got what you wanted. The
call’s coming from up the street. The Hotel Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Have you got the room?</p>
<p><strong>telephone technician</strong>: It’s not that easy. Electronic
switchboard.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Move your SWAT units to the hotel. No… wait.
Any movement will alert the sniper. If he sees any of us withdraw, he
may panic.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: There’s another SWAT unit on the way.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Intercept them. Divert them to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Send them in from the Forty-third Street
side. I don’t want any activity the sniper might catch sight of. He’s
probably high up and facing that booth. He’s got to continue to believe
our full attention is focused on the man inside – whoever the hell that
poor bastard is. Hello 911 operator, I missed some of that. Run it
halfway back and repeat it.</p>
<p><strong>stu’s voice</strong>: ‘… Like you did that pimp. And that
tourist last week. But this time you want me to do the killing for
you…’</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Jesus… he’s a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The police seem all excited about something,
Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Are they? I wasn’t looking.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can’t wait any longer. Say amen, then reach
up for the gun. When your hand comes down, I want to see it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m too afraid.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For once, be brave. Surprise yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’m shaking all over.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Guys in combat situations even shit their
pants. But they follow orders.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: As soon as the cops see a gun, they’ll open
fire.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Then I’d advise you to fire first.</p>
<p><strong>police sniper</strong>: Give me the word.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hard part’s over. Drop your arm and point it
like you’d point your finger and squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. You do it. If you want me dead, then
fucking murder me!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why must I keep invoking some poor girl’s
name every time we come to an impasse? I’m focused back on Kelly again.
You’re obviously not willing to trade your life for hers.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I am! I’m doing it!</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: There! You see it? They all see it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Where are you? Damn you!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Thanks for such an interesting afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Hello? This is Captain Ramey. Somebody talk
to me.</p>
<p><strong>swat officer’s voice</strong>: Yeah. We took him out,
Captain. Nobody else got hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: What’s his condition?</p>
<p><strong>swat officer’s voice</strong>: Critical. The sonofabitch took
two. Probably won’t survive the ride.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Get a statement from him. I’ll be right
over.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Don’t try to sit up.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Rubber bullet.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: You’ll have one hell of a nasty welt. Busted
rib. Maybe a permanent scar there.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It couldn’t hurt much more if you really shot
me.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Somebody was going to and we thought it may
as well be us.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Did you get him?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Sure as hell did. Thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Still alive?</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Barely.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: We’ll be giving him a hypo for the pain.
It’ll put him out for a while.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s okay. I’m not really shot.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: I was so afraid. I thought…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I thought so, too. But we’re going to be
alright. Both of us.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Remember how you swore up and down you’d get
me on TV? Well, you did. I already got interviewed on Fox and Channel
Eleven and they even want me on A.M. America tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Bet you didn’t think I could deliver on
that.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Will you please let go of him, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. No hypo. I want to see him first.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Relax. The guy’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s why I’ve gotta talk to him. Please!</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: You can ride with him in the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: This is Ramey. Over. This is Ramey.
Ten-Four.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Shit. Get everybody off this wavelength.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Hello. Hello! Pick up! Yeah, it’s Ramey
again. Can you hold the phone close enough so the perp can listen?</p>
<p><strong>cop’s voice</strong>: He’s not saying a word, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: He’s not about to talk to us. Maybe to
him.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Forget that. Stand him up. Can you stand?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I can try.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Help him over here.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Here. Speak up.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: It’s me. Do you hear me? Answer me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Had to have the last word, Stu.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I finally beat your ass. Admit it, you
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But you’ll never forget me. I gave you the
most thrilling day of your life. Say thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Now you’re gonna die, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I lost a lot of blood. Don’t you want to
donate some for me? Then we’d really be part of each other.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hang on. I can’t wait to see you at the
hospital. So I can yank your fucking air tube out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wish I could give you that pleasure. You
deserve it. … Only I’m out of time.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What’s your name? At least tell me who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>cop’s voice</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>ramey</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll find out who he is. And
why he picked you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: No. You won’t. What do you want to bet you
won’t?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I’ll spend my whole life trying to figure that
out.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Gotta sleep now. No phone calls…</p>
