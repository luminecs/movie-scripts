<p><strong>man</strong>: Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called
Willie Stark?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. Who’d he shoot?</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Oh, county… uh… treasurer, or something
like that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s so special about him?</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: They say he’s an honest man. What I want
you to do is to hop into your car…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why, you promised me a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Well, that can wait.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah… but there’s a… a girl I know.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Oh… Well, she can wait too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The question is… can I?</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: The answer is… get up there.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right. Oh… uh… what did you say his name
was?</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The fellow’s name.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Oh, the… uh… Stark… Willie Stark.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Willie Stark…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I found him in Kanoma City. A typical, hot,
dusty, backwoods county seat.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …to lie to them in order to line their own
dirty pockets with the taxpayers’ money. When have the citizens of
Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this? Why is the opposition
so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to
make sure I’m not elected county treasurer? Well, I’ll tell you why…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Because they’re afraid of the truth… and
the truth is this. They’re trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said
steal. The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse.
Why? Well, they’ll tell you their reason is the job will be done better.
The county commissioners would have you believe that they’re interested
in public welfare. They’re interested in welfare, sure. But it’s their
own. Let’s look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures.
That brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners. That same brick
factory uses convict labor.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Sorry, Willie, you’ll have to move on.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: more
than five people congregating is disturbing the peace.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: If you folks’ll be so kind as to read these
handbills, my boy will pass them out among you.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: There’s an ordinance against that too.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Pass ’em out, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Let him alone!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Get that camera! Willie, you’re under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where can I find Tiny Duffy?</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Right over there, mister.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh, they told me I could get my camera back
here.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: People. Can I?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: You the reporter that’s been snoopin’ around
town?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you Tiny Duffy?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What paper?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Chronicle.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: You sure come a long way to stick your nose
into other people’s business.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s true… Only my boss on the paper can’t
see it that way.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: It ain’t any of his business either.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Whose business is it?</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Them as is tendin’ to it. County
commissioners that the voters of Kanoma County elected to tend to their
business and not take no buttin’ in from nobody.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You a commissioner?</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Yeah. Name’s Pillsbury. Dolph
Pillsbury.</p>
<p><strong>2nd commissioner</strong>: Me too. I’m a commissioner
too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who isn’t a commissioner?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: He’s the head man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then you’re in a position to know where –</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: He’s in a position to know nothin’. And to
say nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought you said he was head man?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: He uses my head.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Oh, Tiny, you’re a card… Ain’t he a card?
Yeah, he’s a card… Now, who thought up those city ordinances about
arresting someone for making a speech?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Who’s arrested? Nobody’s been arrested. Hi,
Willie.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Hi, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Did you apologize to Willie?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yeah, I apologized to Willie.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Did you give him his handbills back?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yeah, I gave ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Give him back his flag and his bag and… give
this man his camera.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m going to be on that same street corner
tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: You go right ahead, Willie. We all believe in
free speech. We got to… it’s in the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: My boy is out distributing those handbills
now.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: It’s a free country, Willie. If you can
convince the people to vote for you… you go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What did you want to see me about,
Mr. Duffy?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: I wanted you to meet a fella came all the way
up from the state capital to meet you. A reporter. Wants to write you
up… maybe put your picture in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m happy to know you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Burden’s my name… Jack Burden. Can we go
somewhere where we can talk?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Now that ain’t polite. Don’t you want to hear
both sides of the story?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know your side. What happened to the plate
your men took from my camera?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Must have dropped out. Oh, come on, fellas,
let’s relax. It’s a hot day… Hey, Sugar Boy…</p>
<p><strong>sugar boy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Bring some cold beer for the boys.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: None for me, thank you kindly.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Now you know Willie don’t drink, Tiny.
His wife don’t favor drinking. And Willie’s the teacher’s pet, ain’t
you, Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ll have some orange pop if you don’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy. Bring him
some orange pop.</p>
<p><strong>sugar boy</strong>: Th-th-the p-p-pop’s s-s-sold out.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Did you hear that, boys? The p-p- pop’s
s-s-sold out.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Now ain’t he a card?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you… you don’t
say anything. Let’s go, mister.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.</p>
<p><strong>jack and lucy</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: That’s my pa.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ve been talking for a long time,
Mr. Stark.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Willie’s got a lot to say.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have a nap?</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: No, I want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m worried about Tom. It’s getting dark. He
should have been home.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He’s a strong boy. Don’t worry about him. He
can take care of himself.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How old is the boy?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nine years.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He was a neighbor’s boy. They were poor folks.
Both died. I couldn’t have any children, so… He’s a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, he’s the best. I couldn’t love him any
more if he was my own flesh and blood.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And now you, Mrs. Stark?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, there isn’t very much to tell about
me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How did you meet?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I was teaching school and one day a pupil
walked in. It was Willie. I couldn’t have a grown man in the class and
Willie wanted to learn so badly… so I married him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Is that the only reason?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Except that I loved him.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get the coffee, Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: A couple of weeks ago. I’d been teaching for a
long time and nobody ever said I wasn’t all right. But I don’t care. I
don’t want to teach in a schoolhouse that they built just so somebody
can steal some money. And Willie doesn’t want to be Treasurer, either,
if he has to associate with those dishonest people.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m going to run. They can’t keep me from
running.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you don’t mind the truth, Mr. Stark, you
haven’t much of a chance.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m going to run. They’re not going to kick
me around like I was dirt.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I don’t care if Willie loses… just so he gets
the truth to the people. Isn’t that true, Willie?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Isn’t it, Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hmmm?… Yeah, yeah, sure, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, if you lose you can give a little more
time to studying your law books.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, you studying law too?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: By myself, at night.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: Willie’s a smart boy.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: If I ever find the time I’m going to take a
course at the university.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What happened, Tommy boy? What’s the
matter?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I gave out the handbills, Pa.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Speak up. Speak up.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Let him tell it his own way. Go on, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This time they were waiting for me. They took
them away from me. Threw them in the dirt and beat me up. I brought some
of them back.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Good boy. Have you eaten yet, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Let him wash up first.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m going to run… and you’re not going to
stop me. I’m gonna run even if I don’t get a single vote.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here you are… the last of the Willie Stark
articles. Now can I go?</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Yes. You’ve earned your vacation. You’ve
been writing these like you really mean them.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I hadn’t been home in a long time. Only a
hundred and thirty miles from Kanoma City. It was separated from the
mainland by a body of water. For the first time I wondered if it wasn’t
separated by more than that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Floyd, Jack’s home. Oh, he looks fine…
doesn’t he look fine? How do I look, Jackie boy?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You look beautiful, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: I’ve got so many things planned for
you… parties and… it’ll be just like old times. But first, let’s have a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: Can’t that wait until this evening?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Floyd… honey… my son’s home.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: How long do you plan on staying?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Two or three weeks. If that’s all right with
you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: I’m sure your father would be –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stepfather, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Now, Jackie… here we all are. Floyd,
Jackie, myself. To the best time we’ve ever had together.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Excuse me… I…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dr. Stanton, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Is my shingle showing?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Good to see you, boy. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good to see you, Judge. How have you been?
What have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Oh, just sitting here… waiting for all of you
to come home. You know, when a man starts to get old his eyes stray and
play funny tricks on him. As I watched you in that boat I thought sure I
saw a boy of twelve with a fishing rod in his hands. And I was sure the
first thing he’d say would be…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you mind if I kiss your niece, sir?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: To all the good times we’ve had
together at Burden’s Landing. And especially to this one. Because my
son’s home.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank you, Mother. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Monty, Anne and I have been discussing
Jack’s career. What do you think he ought to go in for? Shall he be a
lawyer, doctor…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: We were just discussing whether you
should…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I like what I’m doing, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: You do very well at it. I read your articles
about this fellow… Willie Stark. Very convincing… Too convincing for my
tastes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A lot of people like them.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: A lot of people are fools. Articles like
that shouldn’t be permitted. They only tend to incite people.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: I thought they were very good. I was proud
of you, Jack. I was particularly interested in Stark’s ideas on health
and medicine. You know the conditions at the hospital I work in. They’re
intolerable. I’d like to meet this Willie Stark. He sounds like an
honest man.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: Honest man? This state is full of these
log-cabin Abe Lincolns with price tags on them. The louder he yells the
higher his price.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You think you can buy anything, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: Yes, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: What do you think, Judge?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I think this state could stand a few
changes.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you what I think –</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, please… let’s not talk politics.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Anne is right. I absolutely forbid any
more of it. I know what we need, we need another toast. You propose it,
Monty… you’re so good at it.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: To the young people… to Anne, to Jack, to
Adam… To what lies before them. To the world they’ll make… in spite of
the mistakes we’ve made.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: The mistakes you’ve made, not me. You’re all
still pretty high and mighty, aren’t you? You all think this state needs
a change. You don’t like the way it’s run. Well, who’s going to run it?
Willie Stark? The Judge? You? You can be bought too. As a matter of fact
you have been. And with my money.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: That’s a waste of good liquor. Your mother
wouldn’t approve.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Jack… you go back in and apologize.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Apologize? I’d rather die.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: I’ve got to live with him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I don’t. Neither do you. You don’t love
him, Mother. You never did.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Son, don’t spoil anything now… He can
help you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can get along without him. You need this
house. And the parties. And the cars and the clothes and the lies. I
don’t. It’s the truth, Mother, face it. For once in your life, face
it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. burden</strong>: Anne, please… please make him
understand.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne, Burden’s Landing is a place on the moon.
It isn’t real. It doesn’t exist. It’s me pretending I live on what I
earn. It’s my mother trying to keep herself young, and drinking herself
old doing it. It’s you and Adam living in this house as though your
father were still alive. It’s an old man like the Judge dreaming of the
past… Anne, come away with me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And do what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And live in a shack and eat red beans. Anne,
what do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven’t been sure. You’ve
gone from one thing to the other… a year at law school, and now this job
as a reporter…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you afraid I can’t make a living?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, no, Jack, it isn’t that. I don’t care
about the money. It… it’s just that I… I want you to be something.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is it you want me to be?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t know. It’s just that I want you to be…
to do… something important.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Like your father. All right. I’ll run for
governor. Anne, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I said that.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: All right, Jack. I’ll go away with you. I’ll
do anything you want me to do.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne, I’ve wanted you to say that more than
anything in the world, and now that you’ve said it… Anne, I guess you
were right. I’m not sure of anything, including myself. I’m not sure I
could live up to the… Anne, wait for me. Please wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’ll wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Hello, Jack. Cut your vacation short,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: By the way, Jack, the fellow you wrote the
articles about… uh… Stark.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: He lost.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I guess that’s the end of Willie
Stark.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …Measure of the damages is caused by…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: A breach…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A breach…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Of an agreement…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Of an agreement…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: To sell personal property…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: To sell… Oh, two years of this.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, go on, Willie, go on.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Willie Stark… Bachelor of Law…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: If you’ll just let me take your case…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Really, I’ll wait for my fee. Just as long
as you want me to.</p>
<p><strong>lucy’s voice</strong>: Go on, Willie, go on.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: They’re not going to kick me around
like I was dirt.</p>
<p><strong>lucy’s voice</strong>: If you lose you can give a little more
time studying your law books.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: I’m going to be on that same street
corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy!</p>
<p><strong>duffy’s voice</strong>: By all means. Free speech, free
country, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: That brick factory is owned by a
brother-in-law of one of the commissioners. The county commissioners
rejected the low bid on the schoolhouse.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: All right, children, this is a fire
drill.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Remember now, walk quietly.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh, Lord, I’m punished for voting against an
honest man.</p>
<p><strong>voices of the mourners</strong>: God bless you, Willie. If we
had only listened to you, Willie. You were right, Willie. Let me shake
your hand, Willie. We should have listened, Willie. You were right all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: A voice in the wilderness. A man
named Willie Stark…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How about that, Lucy, that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Get up there. Get up there fast. Your
friend, Willie, is hotter than a firecracker.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Stay there with him.</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: Look, before this Kanoma City business
we had this whole area tied up. Now we’re losing to Hickville.</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: We must find a way to split that
vote.</p>
<p><strong>harrison</strong>: Well, all I know is, the way it is now it
looks like I’m not going to win.</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: I know a way… find a dummy.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Find a dummy. That’s what we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: A guy from the sticks… strong enough to
grab some votes and dumb enough not to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: If you want to listen to a boy from the
sticks, I know just the guy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No more politics, eh, Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No, I worked too hard in my time to get
there. I think I’ll just go on practicing law and make a little more
money.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The question I’d like to know is, why all the
speeches you’re making around the countryside?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Wonder who that is?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Brought some people all the way up from the
state capital just to meet you. Folks, I want you to meet Willie Stark,
the next governor of our state.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Folks, if you’ll just bear patiently with me
for a couple of minutes, I’d like to tell you what this state needs. It
needs a balanced tax program. Now I’d like to give you the facts and the
figures.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How did it sound, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine, Willie, fine.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Say… I forgot to send a telegram to Lucy…
Conductor!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now right here… right here I’d like to add
something about last year’s taxes… eh?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: I wouldn’t add a thing. Just give them the
facts.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Yeah… and the figures.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Great speech.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What this state needs is a balanced tax
program. Last year, last year the state claimed to have spent on
roads…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you mind if I sit with you, Sadie?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Stand… sit…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks… Tell me, what are you on this
merry-go-round for?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I take notes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For whom?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: For those who pay me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Which is.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: People.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Smart people.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Oh, yeah. Anybody that pays me is smart.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You don’t have to be smart to frame a guy like
Willie Stark.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: No. No, brother, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It is a frame, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Why don’t you give me a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: To split the vote and win the election for
Harrison, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: If you know, why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I just want to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, why don’t you tell the boys back home to
save their money. Willie couldn’t steal a vote from… from Abe Lincoln in
the Cradle of the Confederacy.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I wish the poor… had enough sense to have
somebody give him a good greasing for the beating he’s going to get.
’Cause this way all he gets out of it is the ride. Hey, those speeches!
Ain’t they awful? Ain’t they just plain awful? Question to you: if
somebody told him he was a sucker, do you think he’d quit?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know, Sadie. I really don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Did it sound all right, Mr. Burden?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fine, Willie, fine.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Now, friends, if you will bear
patiently with me for a few minutes, I’ll give you the figures. What we
need is a balanced tax program…</p>
<p><strong>jack’s voice</strong>: No, Willie, no.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: What I need is some sleep. Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up yourself! Listen, Willie, try it on
your feet this time.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, no. Wait a minute. My feet are killing
me. Let me stay here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All right… Look, Willie, you tell ’em too
much. Just tell ’em you’re going to soak the fat boys and forget the
rest of the tax stuff.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: That’s what I say.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But it’s the way you say it. Willie, make ’em
cry. Make ’em laugh, make ’em mad, even mad at you. Stir ’em up and
they’ll love it and come back for more. But for heaven’s sake don’t try
and improve their minds.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A man don’t have to be governor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A man don’t have to be governor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, they haven’t counted up the votes
yet.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, I’m going to lose, Mr. Burden. I know
that. Don’t try and fool me. I’m not going to lie to you. I wanted it. I
wanted it so badly I stayed up nights thinking about it. A man wants
something so badly he gets mixed up in knowing what he wants. It’s
something inside of you. I would have made a good governor. Better than
those other fellows.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A great governor.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Since you won’t let me sleep you might at
least give me a drink.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Build them highways… greatest system of
highways in the country.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ll build schools.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing… except Willie here has been saying as
how he’s not going to be governor.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: So you told him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t tell anyone anything… I just
listen.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Told me what? Told me what?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: That you’re not going to be governor.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Jack! Told me what?… Told me what?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: All right! That you’ve been framed, you poor
sap.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Framed?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: And how! Oh, you decoy, you woodenhead decoy!
And you let ’em. You let ’em because you thought you were the little
lamb of God. But you know what you are? Well, you’re the goat! You are
the sacrificial goat! You are a sap… because you let ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sadie! That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Enough? He didn’t even get anything out of
it. Oh, they’d have paid you to take a rap like that, but they didn’t
have to pay a sap like you. Oh, no, you were so full of yourself and hot
air, all you wanted was a chance to stand up on your hind legs and make
a speech: my friends, what this state needs is a good five-cent cigar.
What this state needs is a –</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: He wants to know if it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s what they tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, lay off that. You’re not used to it.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: He’s not used to a lot of things. Are you,
Willie?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why don’t you lay off of him, Sadie?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Are you, Willie? Are you? Are you… are you,
are you, are you?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, things seem to have quieted down.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Yeah, I quieted him down.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. How was he? Noisy?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Oh, he reared some. He’s been telling me all
the things he’s going to do. He’s going to do big things, this fella.
He’s going to be President. He’s going to kill people with his bare
hands. I quieted him down… Hey! Who’s Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: His wife.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: He talks like she’s his mammy… she’s going to
blow his nose for him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I’ll take him from here on in. They’re
waiting for him at the barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Yeah, well give me a receipt for the body and
I’ll be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Willie, Willie… come on, wake up, Willie.
Come on, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Whoops!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Is he drunk?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn’t favor
drinkin’.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: How’d you get him here? He was out stiff.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hair of the dog that bit him.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Hair? He must have swallowed the dog.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great
deal of pleasure to introduce to you that true man of the people, the
next governor of the state… Willie Stark.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: My friends…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: My friends… I…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I have a speech here. It’s a speech about
what this state needs. There’s no need in my telling you what this state
needs. You are the state and you know what you need… You over there…
look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your
stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger?… And you, what about
your crops? Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad
you couldn’t get them to market?… And you. What about your kids? Are
they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, ’cause there’s no
school for them?… No, I’m not going to read you any speech.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: But I am going to tell you a story. It’s a
funny story…</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: …So get ready to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: What’s he up to?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get ready to bust your sides laughing,
’cause it’s sure a funny story. It’s about a hick… a hick like you, if
you please. Yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and gully
washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed
and slop and milk before breakfast… and then set out before sunup and
walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick
knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to
get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and
studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to
change things some… for himself, and for folks like him.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No, I’m not going to lie to you. He didn’t
start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was
going to do for them. No. No, he started off thinking of number one. But
something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself
without the help of the people. That’s what came to him. And it also
came to him, with the powerful force of God’s own lightning, back in his
home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of
politics… rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know
that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten
brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that… So
they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they
wanted him to run for governor…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sadie, he’s wonderful… wonderful…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: …So they told the hick… and he swallowed it.
He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he’d like to
try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought that even
the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find
he’s got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped
pants… they saw the hick and they took him in.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Willie, what are you trying to do?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: There he is! There’s your Judas Iscariot.
Look at him… lickspittle… nose- wiper.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Play! Play!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look at him!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Play anything.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look at him! Joe Harrison’s dummy! Look at
him!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: That’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look at him!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Go get him, boys… go get him.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you. Now,
listen to me, you hicks. Yeah, you’re hicks too, and they fooled you a
thousand times, just like they fooled me. But this time I’m going to
fool somebody. I’m going to stay in this race. I’m on my own and I’m out
for blood.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Listen to me, you hicks…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Listen to me and lift up your eyes and look
at God’s blessed and unflyblown truth… And this is the truth. You’re a
hick. And nobody ever helped a hick but a hick himself.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, listen to me… listen to me. I was
the hick they were going to use to split the hick vote. But I’m standing
right here now on my hind legs… even a dog can learn to do that. Are you
standing on your hind legs? Have you learned to do that much yet? Here
it is, here it is, you hicks. Nail up anybody who stands in your way!
Nail up Joe Harrison! Nail up McMurphy! And if they don’t deliver, give
me a hammer and I’ll do it myself.</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: I want his throat cut, from ear to
ear.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: No use going any further, Jack. We aren’t
printing them any more.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought the Chronicle line was –</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Divide and conquer? Stark is getting too
big for his britches and the hicks are getting too smart. We’re now
supporting Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How do you square that?</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: I work here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I don’t… not any more.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: Jack, you fool.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you had any guts you’d print this…</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: I work here. I take orders.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know. You’ve got a wife and three kids and
your boy goes to Princeton.</p>
<p><strong>madison</strong>: You won’t find it easy to get another
job.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m too rich to work.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We didn’t do so good.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Double bourbon.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Same for me.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: And a beer. I hear you got fired from the
paper.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You heard wrong, Willie. I quit.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re smart. ’Cause before I’m through with
that mob they’re not going to have enough money left to pay the boy that
cleans the spittoons.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How do you feel, Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I feel fine, fine. You see, Jack, I learned
something.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah… what?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How to win.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t see Willie again until his second
campaign… four years later.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I drifted from job to job…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …That is, whenever I could find one.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But always further and further away from Anne,
and the life at Burden’s Landing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But Willie wasn’t drifting. He knew where he
was going.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He had his foot in the door and he kept right
on pushing to get in. He had lost the election but he had won the state…
and he knew it… and the people knew it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They were all hopping on his bandwagon… even
Tiny Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yep, Willie came back like he said he
would.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Do you want to know what my platform is?
Here it is: I’m going to soak the fat boys and I’m going to spread it
thin.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Willie was right – he’d learned how to
win…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He spent a lot of money doing it… an awful lot
of money… I was beginning to wonder where he got it from.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There were rumors throughout the state that
Willie was making deals with all kinds of people… strange deals… for
Willie Stark.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The second time out, it wasn’t a campaign… it
was a slaughter. It was Saturday night in a mining town.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He came back and he took me with him.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This is Jack Burden, a friend of mine. From
now on he’s going to live here. Give him anything he wants.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Let these boys through, officer.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Duffy works for me now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It looks like everybody works for you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No. No, not yet. But I want to keep him
around. He reminds me of something I never want to forget.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Come on, come on, come on, come on. Are
these the boys?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: These are the boys that can get the boys.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How many do you think we can get?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Fifty.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Five dollars a head.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What do you think, Sugar? Do they look like
good boys?</p>
<p><strong>sugar boy</strong>: T-t-they b-b-better be.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get a hundred… All right, go on, all of you.
Blow. Blow, blow. You too, Duffy. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Handbill distributors.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If they all look like them I’d hate not to
take one.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: That’s the object. Not like when they beat
up my boy Tom.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How is Tom?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, he’s fine. He starts college in the
fall.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh. And Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Fine… fine.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Hey, I need a boy… Where’s a boy? Take that
downstairs; they’re waiting for it. Right away, on the double. Listen,
baby, you’ve got to double- space all of this… he can’t read, see.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sadie!</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: And they need four copies. Hi, Jack. How are
you?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sadie is my secretary now. Oh, pardon
me.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Fix your tie, Willie.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hey, Sugar.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Keep everybody out of here. I want to talk
to Jack and Sadie alone.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: From now on you’re working for me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I don’t know. Something will turn up, won’t
it, Sadie?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Yeah. We need a college man around… for
research.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How much did they pay you on that
newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Three hundred dollars a month.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I could buy you cheap, couldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For a bag of salt.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No. No, I don’t play that way. I like you,
boy. I always have. I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give you four
hundred dollars a month and traveling expenses.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You throw money around like it was money.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Money?… I don’t need money. People give me
things.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Because they believe in me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was going home again. But this time it was
different. Now I had a feeling that maybe the waiting was over… for me,
and for Anne.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s a far cry from where I come from… to
this house.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: And standing here under the portrait of one
of the greatest governors of this state, talking to you people… well,
it’s an honor I never thought I’d have.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are there any questions? Mr. McEvoy.</p>
<p><strong>mcevoy</strong>: No, I have no questions.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Judge?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: A few… but it will hold.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: I have a question.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: A lot of people in this state have been
saying that you’ve been making deals… some of them with the very groups
that you claim you’re against. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Adam, you know how rumors start…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yes. Yes, that’s true. I have nothing to
hide. I’ll make a deal with the devil if it’ll help me carry out my
program. But believe me, there are no strings attached to those
deals.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: You’re sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Doc, Jack here has been telling me how you
feel about things… how you’d like to see a new hospital built, a
hospital that’s the biggest and best that money can buy. You want those
things, Doc, because, well, because you’re a man who wants to do good.
Now, I’d like to ask you a question.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Do you know what good comes out of?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: You tell me, Mr. Stark.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Out of bad… that’s what good comes out of.
Because you can’t make it out of anything else. You didn’t know that,
did you?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: No, I didn’t… There’s another question I’d
like to ask you. You say there’s only bad to start with and the good
must come with the bad. Who’s to determine what’s good and what’s bad?…
You?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why, that’s easy. Just… just make it up as
you go along.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Folks, there’s a time to talk and there’s a
time to act. I think the time to act is right now. And with your
support, I not only will win but I will do all of the things I promised.
I need your help. Oh, I need it badly. But I’m not going to beg for it.
In the name of this state which we love… in the name of the governor in
whose house we meet… I demand it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, what do you say, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ve got to say yes. With you in the
race…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m an old bird… I…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: But a game one.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look, I’ll give you complete power as
attorney general. You can do anything you see fit. I’ll swing the ax to
clear the way for you. Is that a deal?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: It’s a deal.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Jack, we have to get back to town… a lot to
do. Dr. Stanton.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m very glad to have met you.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: We want Willie! We want Willie!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This is not a time for speechmaking. I
should get on my knees and ask God to give me strength to carry out your
will.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This much I swear to you. These things you
shall have. I’m going to build a hospital. The biggest that money can
buy… and it will belong to you. That any man, woman, or child who is
sick or in pain can go through those doors and know that everything will
be done for them that man can do. To heal sickness. To ease pain. Free.
Not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right that every child
shall have a complete education. That any man who produces anything can
take it to market without paying toll. And no poor man’s land or farm
can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people
that they will not be deprived of hope…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Does he mean it, Jack? Does he?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: That’s his bribe.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What if it was his bribe! He swept the old
gang out of office. What if they hollered like stuck pigs? He jammed
through bill after bill and the people got what they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I demand that this bill be passed. Nobody’s
going to tell me how to run this state.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He started to build the roads, the schools,
the power dams, to change the face of the state from one end to the
other… His methods?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Politics is a dirty game… and he played it
rough and dirty. Willie’s little black book was a record of sin and
corruption. And me, Jack Burden? I kept the book and added up the
accounts.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Clown, show-off, playboy, they yelled at him.
Building football stadiums. Fiercely proud of his son who played in
them.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, look at him go. He’s going to be
All-American.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They said he was building up a private army.
But he was building, always building…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Always playing up to the crowd. Letting them
trample on tradition. Well, tradition needed trampling on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The crowd loved it… Willie loved it… and so
did I.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: You low-down, no-good redneck…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What goes on here?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: That’s what Sadie wants to know. The boss
poses for too many pictures.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why, Sadie, I’m surprised at you.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I hate all women.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Was she pretty?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Was she pretty?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I met her on the street I’d never recognize
her.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Was she pretty?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How should I know? I wasn’t looking at her
face… Look, if it’s going to cause all this grief, why don’t you let him
go?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Let him go? I’ll kill him. I’ll drive him out
of this state.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just because a guy’s sitting with a couple of
girls on his knees in public…</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Public or private… I know him. How about what
happened in Chicago? That girl on skates… and the time you both went to
St. Louis… There’s a new invention, you know, Photography and newsreels.
Willie Stark in a nightclub… Willie Stark with a blonde.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You could always bleach your hair.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I could also break every bone in his neck.
After all I’ve done for him… Now he goes two-timing me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s been two-timing Lucy. So there’s another
kind of arithmetic for what he’s doing to you.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Lucy? If she had her way he’d be back in
Kanoma City slopping the hogs right now. And he knows it. He knows what
she’d do for him. She had her chance.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You seem to think Lucy’s on her way out, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: He’ll ditch her… Give him time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You ought to know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, you got the wrong guy. I’m not the hero
of this piece.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, come on, both of you. Let’s go,
hurry it up.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Come on. Pillsbury put his hand in the pork
barrel and got caught. You know, I never did trust that guy.</p>
<p><strong>newsmen</strong>: Have you heard about Pillsbury? What do you
intend to do about Pillsbury? How about it, Governor?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Later, boys, later. Say, Jack, go back and
get the Judge. Let’s get him over to my hotel just as soon as you
can.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I waited for you. Hello. You promised we
could… uh… discuss my charity project… Children’s home?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, I’m very sorry. Something very
important came up. You’ll call me later, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes, certainly.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years old,
gut-sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. If the Almighty had intended
for you to be rich he’d have taken care of that a long time ago. The
idea of you being rich… that’s plain blasphemy. Ain’t that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Louder, man. Don’t mumble. Speak up. Say
it’s a fact, a blasphemous fact.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: It’s a fact, a blasphemous fact.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Yeah?… Oh, I see. Dumond can’t come. He says
his wife is sick.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I don’t care if she’s dying. Sugar, get the
car. Get him and bring him over here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now, you know what you’re supposed to do,
don’t you, Pillsbury? You’re supposed to stay poor and take orders. Oh,
there’ll be some sweetening for you from time to time… but Duffy’ll take
care of that. Don’t you go setting yourself up on your own again, do you
understand that?</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Louder, man. And say, I understand that.</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: I understand that.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: See who that is, Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I’ll be with you
in just a couple of seconds. Now write what I tell you to write… Dear
Governor Stark. I wish to resign as auditor due to ill health, to take
effect as soon as you can relieve me. Respectfully yours. Did you sign
it?</p>
<p><strong>pillsbury</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, sign it! Don’t put any date on it. I
can fill that in when I need it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now bring it to me.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now get out.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The papers have the story.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: They’re talking about impeachment
proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Against who?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This time, Pillsbury.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I got that “this time,” Judge.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: How true is it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s too true.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Yes? This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on the
wire.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What have we got on Hopkins, Jack? Hello,
Jeff. About that Pillsbury business… Here’s what I want you to do when
it comes up in the legislature. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You
listen to me. You got a mortgage coming due on that place of yours in
about five weeks, haven’t you? You’d like to get it renewed, wouldn’t
you? All right, Tiny’ll talk to you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get going, Tiny.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You haven’t answered my question. Why are you
saving Pillsbury’s hide?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m not a bit interested in Pillsbury’s
hide. It’s something much more important than that. If the McMurphy boys
get the notion they can get away with this, there’s no telling where
they’ll stop.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Or where you will… Pillsbury is guilty. As
attorney general of this state, it’s my job to prosecute.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was… was
human. He isn’t. He’s a thing. You don’t prosecute an adding machine if
the spring goes busted and makes a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed
him. I’m not a bit interested in Pillsbury. It’s something much bigger
than that.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s right, Judge. Can’t you see that he’s
right?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: He’s right because you want him to be right.
Because you’re afraid to admit you’ve made a mistake. Do it now before
it’s too late. I’m offering my resignation as attorney general. You’ll
have it in writing by messenger in the morning… dated.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It took you a long time to make up your
mind, Judge. A long time. What made you take such a long time?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: And now you are?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ll tell you what you are. You’re scared.
You sat in that big easy chair of yours for thirty years and played at
being a judge. Then all of a sudden I came along and put a bat in your
hand, and I said, go ahead, Judge, start swinging. And you did. And you
had a wonderful time. But now you’re scared. You don’t want to get your
hands dirty. You want to pick up the marbles… but you don’t want to get
your hands dirty. Look at my whole program, Judge. How do you think I
put that across?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I knew how, but I never knew why.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re not by any chance thinking of going
over to McMurphy’s boys, are you?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m through with politics.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m happy to hear that. No hard
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Goodbye, Governor. Are you coming with me,
Jack?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You’re making a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Do you think he means it when he says he’s
through with politics, Sadie?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: No. No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What about you, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ve known the Judge all my life. He’s always
meant everything he’s said.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right. All right. Take it easy. I’ll
take your word for it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sugar, take Miss Stanton home. When am I
going to see you again?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s the matter, Anne?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Please take me home now, Sugar Boy.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’ve got to understand me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I understand you. It’s myself I don’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Do you think I like sneaking around corners
any more than you do? But right now, with the Pillsbury business and
with your uncle quitting… If I got a divorce…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Maybe we’d better stop seeing each other.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No. No, we won’t stop seeing each other,
will we?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Because you believe in what I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Because I believe what you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Good evening, Governor Stark. I thought you
might like to know that Judge Stanton kept his promise. He gave the
story to every paper in town.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon as you
can.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: These are serious charges that Judge
Stanton has given to the press. This legislature is entitled to a
complete and full report on the Pillsbury affair. Let the truth be
known.</p>
<p><strong>2nd senator</strong>: Let it come out.</p>
<p><strong>3rd senator</strong>: I move that we adjourn.</p>
<p><strong>4th senator</strong>: I second the motion.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: All those in favor, say aye… Motion
carried. The house is adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: If you let Willie Stark get away with the
Pillsbury graft, there’s no telling…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But we beat the Pillsbury rap… It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: These things are never over. I’ll tell you
what I want you to do, Jack. I want you to start a new page in that
black book of yours… under then name of Judge Stanton.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re crazy. There’s nothing on the
Judge.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Why? Because his name is Stanton?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Ssshhh, easy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What if I won’t do it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You know, some of this has rubbed off on
you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you going to do? Have me shot?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No… no… but I’ll have to get myself a new
boy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I tell you there’s nothing on the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Jack, there’s something on everybody. Man is
conceived in sin and born in corruption.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s a waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s the matter, Jack? Are you afraid you
might find something out?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I kept saying to myself that Willie was wrong
about the Judge. If there was anything left at Burden’s Landing, it was
honor. I had to believe that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne, I want to ask you a question. Was the
Judge ever broke? Really broke?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t want to know, but I’ve got to.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Did he tell you –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did who tell me?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t know. I… how should I know if the
Judge was ever broke?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Hello… Come on, Anne, take this food and
start cooking. I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me, I’m on the thirsty side. Bring some
glasses, Anne, quick.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: It’s been a long time since I played this
thing. What do you say we wake up the ghosts, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Another glass, Anne, for a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Remember the last time I played this? You
and Anne were dancing?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shall we dance?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Let’s… let’s have a drink first.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, no… keep playing. Anne and I want to hear
this, don’t we, Anne? Adam… ghost… and me.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: What shall we drink to?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: To the ghost?… To Adam, to the director of the
new medical center.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Don’t you ever stop working for him?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Adam!</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: I came up here to get away…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, I’m not. What’s wrong with being the
director of the new medical center?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Nothing, except that I’m not going to take
it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why? Because your uncle resigned?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: That’s partly it. There are other
things.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What other things?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: You too?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes, me too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne, if Adam doesn’t want to discuss it,
let’s not.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: All right, let’s discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But calmly.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Calmly. Go ahead, Jack. Why do you think he
wants me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because you’re the best man for the job.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: It could have nothing to do with my name
being Stanton?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It could have. Let’s grant that.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: That’s your answer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, it’s not. If that were the only answer I
wouldn’t be with him any more. There’s another side of it. I’ve learned
something from him. You can’t make an omelet without cracking eggs.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Or heads.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: But at least a hospital will be built, and the
sick will be cared for.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: At what price?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: At any price.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Do you really believe that, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I really believe that Stark wants to do good.
You do too. It’s a matter of method. Many times out of evil comes good.
Well, pain is an evil. As a doctor you should know that.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It is not
evil in itself. Stark is evil.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The people of the state don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: How would they know? The first thing he did
was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. Why be so afraid
of criticism? If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be
interested in the truth. I don’t see how you can separate the two. No,
Stark is not for me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No, Stark is not for you. Well, what is for
you? Pride. Pride, that’s all it is… foolish, stupid pride. All you’ve
ever talked about is what you could do if… if somebody would tear down
and build. All right, all right, somebody has, and he’s given it to you.
But he’s not for you. No, he’s not for you.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Anne… Anne…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will I find anything, Judge? Will I? I didn’t
find it all at once. It takes a long time to go through old courthouse
records and musty deeds… a very long time. But it wasn’t too hard for
me. I was well trained in research, especially this kind.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I found what I didn’t want to find.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Have some photostat copies made of these. I’ll
be back tomorrow for them.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>sadie’s voice</strong>: It’s me, Sadie Burke.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All right, come in.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot of
whisky. You sober?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stone.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I’ll have one with you. What are you hiding
out for?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not. I’ve been sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: For four days? You’ve been back in town for
four days.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Willie knows everything.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Willie’s worried about his boy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Willie’s boy is worried about Willie’s
boy.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Well, why don’t you put something on the
phonograph – a low-down, mean blues. Play it over and over again until
you’re sick of it. Then crack it and go back to work. I do it all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s not my problem.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: No, it isn’t your problem. I’ll wait for you
if you want to powder your nose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll be with you in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I’ve got to look in
the mirror to be able to see it. Soft, white skin… not like mine. I had
smallpox when I was a kid. Where I lived it seemed nearly all the kids
had smallpox…</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: It leaves your face hard. Then she’s got
poise. Look at the way she holds her head… at just the right angle. That
takes training. That takes years of training…</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I see what Willie sees. Willie’s got big
ideas, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: A girl like that could be a governor’s wife.
Or even a President’s.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and he’ll
ditch you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: He’ll ditch everybody in the whole world
because that’s what Willie wants. Nobody in the world but him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: You and your high-tone friends. What do they
know? What do they know about anything? Why did you have to mix her
in?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re crazy, Sadie. You’re out of your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Am I? Well, why don’t you go down and ask
her. Or ask him. Ask Willie.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Go ahead, ask him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Ask him!</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Ow-oo… oh… oh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s off today.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s only practice. He’ll be all right
tomorrow… You been gone a long time, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. I figured if you needed me you’d
yell.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why’d you lay around the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thinking.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Things.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What did you find on the Judge?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You sure you didn’t find anything on the
Judge?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re going to keep trying, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you want me to.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I want you to. There’s something else I want
you to do too.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What? Bucket boy? Towel slinger? What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s eating you, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What else do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: If you’ve got something on your mind, boy,
spit it out. We’ve been together too long to play games.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I hear your pal Adam Stanton turned down the
job as director of the hospital. That’s bad. Especially at a time like
this.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh? How did you hear it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why? What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I just wanted to know.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I heard it around.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How did you hear he turned it down,
Willie?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ll be right back, Jack. I want to see
what’s happening here.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: You going to practice the way I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m going to do it the way I want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Tom, come here. What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: I don’t care if he is your son, Governor… No
special rules for him.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It doesn’t make any difference to me either
way… whether I play or not.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, it does to me. What do you want him to
do?</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: To behave himself. Like the rest of the boys.
Four times this season he’s broken training. He comes on the practice
field half potted.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Tom, you’re going to have to obey the rules.
Do you hear me? You’re going to obey the rules.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I put ’em across, don’t I? Every Saturday I put
’em across and I can still do it, drunk or sober. That’s all you want,
isn’t it… for me to put ’em across so you can big-shot it around? Isn’t
that all you want?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Tom! He’s a little high-strung. Tom, come
here. Tom!</p>
<p><strong>helene</strong>: Come on, Tommy… let’s go faster. Come
on…</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: It’s the governor’s son.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Willie, Mr. Hale’s here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Go on upstairs, Lucy. I have some business I
want to talk over with Mr. Hale.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: What I’ve got to say anybody can listen to…
Where’s your boy?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Now… now, don’t get excited. Get me another
drink, Sugar.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: My daughter may die.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: She’s not going to die. She’ll get the best
medical attention there is. No expense will be spared.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Where’s your boy?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Wait a minute, Lucy. He’s asleep. And the
doctor said after a good night’s sleep he’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No, he won’t be all right unless you make him
all right. I’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Lucy! You care for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Accidents will happen, you know.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Accidents? Your boy was drunk.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I saw the police report. There… there was
nothing about drunkenness on the police report.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Whose police and whose report? I say the boy
was drunk. And I know it.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Right here before your father… I want you
–</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Mr. Hale –</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Tom, the doctor says you need rest, boy.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t want you to try to cover up for me. I
was wrong… that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You don’t know what you’re talking about. I
saw the police report –</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t care what the police report says. I was
driving and I was drunk. It’s all my fault. Anything you want to do to
me, you can do. Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nobody has to do anything. Stop worrying.
I’ll take care of everything.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t want you to take care of anything.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Tom, go on upstairs and get some rest, boy.
Go on… go on… go on.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sugar, help him… Mr. Hale, come on over and
sit down. You sure you wouldn’t care for a drink, Mr. Hale?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hey, Tiny, go home. Go on, out of here… out
of here. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What business did you say you were in?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: I didn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What business are you in?</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: Trucking business.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Trucking business. Trucks run on state
roads. If a man in the trucking business had a contract with the state,
a big one, that would be pretty good, wouldn’t it? Go on, Jack. Tell him
what would happen.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Go on, tell him.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You’re trying to bribe me, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No, no. No, I’m not trying to bribe you.
I’m… I’m only talking things over with you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>hale</strong>: You’re pretty good at talking. I remember when
you first started talking. A place called Upton. You did a lot of
talking then and the things you said made sense, to me and a lot of
other people. I believed in you… I followed you… and I fought for you.
Well, the words are still good. But you’re not. And I don’t believe you
ever were.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sugar, follow him. Keep calling in.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Lucy!… Lucy!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’d like Anne to see you now. I’d like Anne to
see you now, you drunken sot! Come on.</p>
<p><strong>newsmen</strong>: What about the girl’s father, Governor?
Have you a statement to make?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, all right, gentlemen. I’ll give
you a statement. This whole thing is a mess of lies. It’s a frame. The
man that made that statement… have him repeat it to my face. He can’t.
He vanished. Let me ask you some questions. Where has he gone? Where is
he?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Maybe you could answer those questions
too, Governor.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I won’t dignify that question with an
answer.</p>
<p><strong>another reporter</strong>: One more question, Governor…
Where’s your son?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: At the football stadium, where he’s supposed
to be. He’s going to play for State University, which this
administration is responsible for. He’s not hiding from anybody,
gentlemen. He’ll be out there in full view of seventy thousand cheering
fans. One of which will be me. See you, men.</p>
<p><strong>crowd voices</strong>: Where’s Stark? How about Tommy Stark?
Hey, Willie, send your boy in.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why don’t they put him in!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come on, Willie… send your boy in.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: What’s the matter, Willie… is your little boy
ashamed to show his face?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get that man out of here! Come on, get him
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They’re booing you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ever since the accident, my head…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: The doctor said it was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Get dizzy… can’t see… dizzy…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re scared… plain scared.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Atta boy… get mad. Show some spirit. Jack,
tell him what his playing means. Go on, tell him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can never tell about a head injury. Maybe
the boy’s hurt.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He’s hurt? I’m hurt. It wasn’t me that
wrapped that car around the tree. It wasn’t me that got drunk. But me,
I’m takin’ the rap. Go on, kid. Get out there and play. Show ’em the
kind of stuff a Stark is made of.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tom… cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: All right, I’ll play. Now get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>p.a. announcer</strong>: Stark’s going in!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Tommy… Tommy… Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>sugar boy</strong>: B-b-boss, you gotta eat. You g-g-
gotta.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m the one that made him play. I sent him
in.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Sit down, Willie. Please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I sent him in.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What difference does that make now?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What goes on?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There isn’t a plane flying.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They gotta fly. This is my son. He’s got to
live.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: I just got a call from Dr. Birnham. The
earliest he can possibly get here will be tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Isn’t there anybody else we can get?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I still think Dr. Stanton should operate.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: That’s up to Governor Stark. He wanted
another doctor… a specialist. I sent for one.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How bad is it really, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: He’s unconscious… and paralyzed.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Has he got a chance?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: To live? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Even if the operation’s successful – that
is, if he lives – I think he’ll be paralyzed for life.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’ll do everything you can, won’t you?
Anything between you and me.. that won’t count, will it? It doesn’t have
to. Look, doc, anything you want in the world you just ask for it and
you got it. Go on, doc… ask for it.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: There are some things, Governor Stark, that
even you can’t buy. Do you want me to operate, or don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yes… I want you to operate. Please, may I see
Tom now?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How much does the doc know?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, you know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: About Anne and me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He doesn’t know a thing… not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Jack, how is he?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The boy?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’ll live.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, thank God. How is –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Willie?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He blames himself, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’ll find someone else to blame in a few
days.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, I tried to call here at the hospital, but
I just…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne… Anne, why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He wasn’t like anybody I ever knew before.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You mean he wasn’t like me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He wasn’t like anybody I ever knew before. I
love him, I guess. I guess that’s the reason.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everybody loves him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He wants to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you going to?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Not now. It would hurt him. A divorce would
hurt his career.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: His career!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Jack… Jack, what are you going to do? You
can’t leave him now. He needs you now more than he ever did before.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What Willie needs, Willie’s got.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You don’t know him. You’ve known him all these
years and you don’t really know him at all.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What about Adam?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Adam?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, you don’t have to worry about him. If
Adam finds out it’ll be easy to prove a Stanton is no different than
anybody else. Just show him these. Willie was right… a man is conceived
in sin and born in corruption. Even Judge Stanton. Show them to him,
Anne. Change the picture of the world that Adam has in his head, just
like our picture of it has been changed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Wipe out everything he’s ever believed in.
It’ll be good for him. There’s no God but Willie Stark. I’m his prophet
and you’re his… Oh, Anne… Anne, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean… Anne!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s all right, officer… we both work for
Willie Stark.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Right over there, that’s going to be the
main building… fifteen stories high, like on the model. Over there,
that’s the laboratory. Finest technical equipment in the world.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: What are you trying to convince me of? I’ve
taken the job.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: My reasons are my own. Why are you building
a hospital?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: To do some good for the people of the
state.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: And get some votes.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, there are lots of ways to get votes.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Yes, I know… I won’t stand for any
interference.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I won’t interfere. I may fire you, but I
won’t interfere.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: If that’s a threat, you’re wasting your
time. You know what I think of your administration.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yes, I know. I’ll tell you what… You stay on
your side of the fence; I’ll stay on mine. Is that a deal?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now he had us all… me, Anne, and Adam. Now we
all worked for him.</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: And so the eyes of the entire
nation are now focused upon Governor Willie Stark, an amazing phenomenon
on the American political scene. The whole state is filled with his
accomplishments – each of them, of course, bearing his personal
signature, to make sure that no one will ever forget who gave them to
the state.</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: This is the way the roads used to
be. But there are those who claim that they were adequate for the
people’s needs, that you don’t need a four- or six-lane highway for a
horse and buggy.</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: When Stark boasts of his great
school system, his critics say: you can’t go to school and work in the
fields at the same time. And they question the benefit of these
projects, charging that the need and the poverty of the people is as
great as before.</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: Willie Stark has never forgotten
the source of his power: the people who supported him.</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: He still keeps in touch with these
people of the backwoods, making periodic trips to such places as Kanoma
City, now famous as his birthplace…</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: For those who say that Willie
Stark is a man of destiny, there are others who claim that he is a man
of evil, a man who cares neither for the people nor the state, but only
for his own personal power and ambition.</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: Obviously, these ambitions go far
beyond the boundaries of the state. Just how far, only time will tell.
Meanwhile, he is here…</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: …and from the looks of things, he
is here to stay. Willie Stark: messiah or dictator?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: How do you like it, Governor?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How many theaters will this play in?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: All over the country.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hear that, Jack. All over the country.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, there’s one thing in there I didn’t like
too well. That messiah or dictator.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: That’s our point of view, Governor. And
that’s the way it stands.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, all right, that’s the way it
stands… as of now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hello, Lucy… How are you making it, Pa?… How
are you, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I made some refreshments for your friends.
I’ll get them.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No, thank you. Thank you kindly.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you don’t mind, Mrs. Stark… the boys have
to get back to make the morning editions. Set ’em up on the porch,
fellows. We’ll take some pictures out here, first.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mrs. Stark, please… All right, fellows, take
one down there, will you please… Shoot it up this way.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re still a great cook, Lucy. Great cook.
Well, I guess I better be getting back to town. Nice to have spent the
day with the family. Goodbye, Lucy. Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Take care of yourself, Pappy. Oh, uh… how do
you like the new radio I got you? You know how it works? You can get
police calls on it. Come here, come here… I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This one for police calls up here.</p>
<p><strong>police broadcast</strong>: Car sixty-two, proceed to five-
eighteen Oak Street. Tom Jones beating his wife again.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, go ahead, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: We interrupt this program to
bring you a special announcement. This afternoon, the body of Richard
Hale, father of the girl who died in the automobile accident involving
the governor’s son, was found. A medical examination revealed he was
beaten to death.</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: The ugly charge of “official
murder” has been hurled at the administration by a coalition of Stark’s
opponents, led by Judge Stanton, lately an outspoken critic of the
administration.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Your friend, the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: Thus an almost forgotten incident
provided the spark that might set off the explosion needed to rock
Willie Stark out of power. The latest report is that impeachment
proceedings may be instituted…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How long will it take you to pack? I want
you to go back to Capital City with me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Because I need you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ll explain all of that later. Now, Lucy,
do like I say.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You stay right here, Jack. I want you bear
witness to what I’ve got to say.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: She can be a witness too.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: I’m going back to the capital and get hold of
Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You stay right here, Sadie.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Somebody’s got to go back to the capital.
I’ll go in the other car.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, then tell Duffy not to do
anything or say anything until I get there.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Yes, Governor.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Now he needs us. Now that he’s in trouble he
needs us, so he can lead us around like monkeys with rings in our noses.
So he can say to people, look at me, feel sorry for me… just a family
man with a wife and a crippled son…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Willie!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why don’t you leave us alone?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Leave him alone. How many scrapes have I
gotten him out of? How many girls?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Willie, stop.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s not him they’re after. It’s me. How
many halfwitted apes do you think I’m going to have to pay to square
this one? What do you think this is going to cost me?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What do you think it cost him?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A man builds for his son. That’s all he
builds for.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Willie! Tom… Tom.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Give me a drink, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: She’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>pappy</strong>: No good, Willie. No good.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Mr. Speaker, I offer a house resolution.
Whereas Willie Stark, governor of this state, has been guilty of
incompetence, corruption, and favoritism in office – yes, and other high
crimes – that he is hereby impeached, and ordered to be tried by the
senate.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s the score?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: They’re lined up against you solid. They had
a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How do you know? Were you there?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Me? What would I be doing there?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Selling me out.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How many votes have we got?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: We need twenty.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: We might be able to dig up a few more.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah. Do you know how?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, Jack. Come here. What have you got in
your black book about that old friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You know who I’m talking about… your old
friend, the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If and when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: If and when? I need it right now. He’s got
four senators wrapped up in his hip pocket. Come on, come on, boy… what
have you got?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m going to give him a break. If he can prove
it isn’t true, I won’t spill it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I ought to bust you, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I promised two people I’d do it this way.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Myself… and someone else. It doesn’t matter
who. I’m going to give him a break.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, give him a break. But if you got
the facts, you got the facts. The truth is sufficient… just like it says
in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s the way it’s going to be.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: All right, boy… I’ll trust you. Where are
you going?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll be around.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Who else do you think he promised,
Willie?</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: You’d be smart… play square with him. You’re
going to need people like us around.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The chips were down, and Willie knew it. He
was fighting for his life. He roared across the state making one speech
after another. And all of them added up to the same thing… “It’s not me
they’re after, it’s you!”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Willie hollered foul. Willie knew if you
hollered long enough, hard enough, and loud enough, people begin to
believe you. Just in case they didn’t, he organized spontaneous
demonstrations.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Tell the boys to get the hicks out. Bring
’em in from the sticks, empty the pool halls. Turn ’em out. Turn the
yokels out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: In case anyone hollered back, he organized
spontaneous slugging. Willie pulled every trick he ever knew – and added
a few more.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey, Sugar! You’ll never live to be
impeached!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Boy, I’ll live to be President…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’ve got fourteen senators to vote against
impeachment. If I win, you’re out of politics.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: I’ll do whatever the Judge says.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And always the trail led to one place…
Burden’s Landing… and the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You sure you don’t want me to go in with
you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, hurry it up, boy. We’ve got places to
go.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Judge, I beg you, as a favor to yourself, to
me… call up, release your votes.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I made a mistake once, Jack… when I resigned.
It was too easy then, just resigning, pulling out. No, Jack, I’ve made
my choice. I have nothing more to lose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Judge, you know what Stark is capable of.
Think it over. I’ll leave now. I’ll come back tomorrow and we’ll talk
about it again. You can give me your answer then.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I can’t wait until tomorrow. I’m a very
impatient man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I told you not to come in here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is it true, Judge, that you’re behind the
impeachment proceedings?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes, it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I wanted to hear you say it with your own
silver tongue.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Well, you’ve heard it. If that’s all you came
to hear you could have saved yourself a trip.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Mind if I pour myself a drink? How about
you, Judge, will you have one? You better… You’re going to need it.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’d he say, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ll get your answer tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Are you kidding? Did you show it to him, or
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Show me what?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: That’s what I figured. Let’s get down to
cases, Judge. Do you remember a man with the name of Littlepaugh?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Remember the Fortune Electric Company?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Of course. I was their counsel for over ten
years.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Remember how you got the job?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Do you remember how you got the job?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You know, Judge, dirt’s a funny thing. Some
of it rubs off on everybody. How did you get the job, Judge?
Blackmail?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I swear I never even remembered his name.
Isn’t that remarkable, Jack? I never even remembered his name. It’s all
so long ago it’s hard for me to realize it ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah. But it did.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes, it did. But it’s difficult for me to
realize it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For me too, Judge.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Thanks for that much.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, I guess you know what the next move
is, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes, I do. Jack Burden. Willie Stark’s
hatchet man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I asked you… how did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This would never stand at law, not for a
minute. It happened over twenty- five years ago, and you could never get
any testimony. Everybody is dead.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Everybody except you, Judge. You’re alive.
And people think you’re a certain kind of man. And you just couldn’t
bear for people to think otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Ever since then I… I’ve done my duty. I… I’m
responsible for many good things. But I also did this.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yes, yes, you did.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Judge, I beg of you, call and release your
votes, for your sake.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You have tender sensibilities for a hatchet
man. Good night, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How about my answer?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You’ll have it in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I want it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: In the morning. Good night, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: We’ve got a lot to do. It’s getting late,
Jack. Let’s get back to town.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know we’re through, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Aw, you don’t mean that, boy.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s all right, doc. Just here to discuss
some politics with the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Oh, I see. Well, good night.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did you give him –</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Wait a minute, Jack –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Answer me. Did you give –</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Aren’t you going back with him?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Why not? You belong with him. Jack, how
could you have done it? When Anne brought me those papers she told me
you promised not to tell Stark until…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah. I know. Well, I kept my promise.</p>
<p><strong>stanton</strong>: Anne? Anne?</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: From all over the state they’re
streaming in. From the hill country and farms, the lumber camps… by
boat, by train, by horse, and on foot. Willie Stark’s army.</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: The state capital is filled with
rumors, one of which is that Stark is planning to seize power by force.
As commander of the state militia, he has –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come in. The door’s open.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Jack…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I want to see you cry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I called you. All afternoon I’ve been calling
you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know. I was here.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’ve got to tell Adam. You’ve got to see
him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tell him what?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He knows about me and…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: About you and Willie?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I tried to explain to him. I… I tried to
explain to him that it wasn’t the way he thought it was.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How was it, Anne? You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He hit me, Jack. My own brother… he hit
me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your brother is an old-fashioned man. He
believes in his sister’s honor. Me, I’m a modern man. The
twentieth-century type. I run.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m frightened, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For who? Your brother, or Willie?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: We’re through.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who’s through with who?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He called me this afternoon. He’s going back
to Lucy. He said it was better that way.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Better for who? Him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Both of us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did he tell you that too when he asked you to
betray the Judge? At least I walked out on him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh Jack… help me, please, please. Adam’s all
I’ve got left now. Oh, Jack, if you ever loved me…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If I ever loved you. I’ll go find Adam.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Where do you think you’re going? Oh, I’m sorry.
I didn’t recognize you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you know who Dr. Stanton is?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did he try to come through here today?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Haven’t seen him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, can you check the other entrances?</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: There’s no other entrances today. The other
entrances are blocked off. Orders are to take no chances.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: If you care to come inside and wait,
Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, thanks. I’ll wait out here. If Dr. Stanton
shows up, let me know. Pass the word along to the boys, will you?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker</strong>: All right now. Everybody… that means
everybody… let’s let Willie know we’re here! All together: WE</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: We will first proceed to take the judgment
of the senate on the question of the impeachment of the governor.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask us to
vote in the face of the kind of intimidation and pressure that has been
exerted here in the past few weeks. Even that crowd outside, yelling on
cue, is part of that pressure.</p>
<p><strong>crowd noise</strong>: We want Willie. We want Willie.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Attention, please. Attention, please.
This is a special announcement from Willie Stark to you people out
there. He doesn’t want any one of you to leave…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: He wants you to stay in front of this
state Capitol until the fight is over. If you want Willie Stark to win,
stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Do you hear me… stay where you are. Don’t
go away. Stay where you are. Don’t go away.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Attention, please. Attention, please. The
balloting on the impeachment proceedings against Governor Stark has just
ended. This is the result: Willie Stark has won.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They tried to ruin me. But they are ruined.
They tried to ruin me because they did not like what I have done. Do you
like what I have done?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Remember, it’s not I who have won, but you.
Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and I shall live
in your right and your will. And if any man tries to stop me from
fulfilling that right and that will, I’ll break him. I’ll break him with
my bare hands. For I have the strength of many.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hello, Jack boy, I’m glad you’re here. I
knew you’d come back.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh, doctor, I’m very glad to see you.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Stand back, everybody. Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>sugar boy</strong>: D-does it hurt m-much, boss? D-d- does it
hurt much?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne, Anne… Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t know. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, that’s too easy.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Leave me alone, please.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, no more.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: My brother’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ve got to go on living.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So that Adam’s death has meaning, so that it
wasn’t wasted. Anne, our life has to give his death meaning. Don’t you
see that? Look at those people…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look at them! They still believe in him. And
we’ve got to make them see Willie the way Adam saw him, or there’s no
meaning in anything… anything.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Mr. Burden… the governor’s asking for
you. You better hurry. He’s going fast.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will you wait here?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will you wait here?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It could have been the whole world, Willie
Stark. The whole world… Willie Stark. Why did he do it to me… Willie
Stark? Why?</p>
