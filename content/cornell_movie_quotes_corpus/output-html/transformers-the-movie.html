<h1 id="transformers-the-movie">transformers-the-movie</h1>
<p><strong>arblus</strong>: Transform and flee, Kranix! You must warn
all you meet of the horror of Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature is
surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has
simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid.</p>
<p><strong>kranix</strong>: Arblus! No!</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It is the year 2005. The treacherous
Decepticons have conquered the Autobots’ home planet of Cybertron. But
from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron’s moons the valiant
Autobots prepare to retake their homeland.</p>
<p><strong>ironhide</strong>: Every time I look into this thing, my
circuits sizzle. I’m tired of this waiting game, Prime. When are we
gonna start bustin’ Deceptichops?</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: We still don’t have enough Energon
cubes to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.</p>
<p><strong>ironhide</strong>: Then let me make another run to Autobot
City on Earth. I’ll bring you back more cubes than you’ll know what to
do with.</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.</p>
<p><strong>yahoo!</strong>: Your days are numbered now
Decepticreeps.</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Jazz, report security status.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: No sign of Decepticons in this sector,
Prime.</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: What about Moon Base 2?</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Jazz to Moon Base 2.</p>
<p><strong>another moon</strong>: This is the second moon. It is much
closer to Cybertron than the first one. This is where Bumblebee and
Spike are stationed.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Jazz to Moon Base 2.</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: Bumblebee and Spike here.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: We’re about to send up the bird. Any
Decepticon shenanigans in your sector?</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: All clear, Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Hey, Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I miss
him, and tell him I’ll be coming home as soon as we’ve kicked Megatron’s
tail across the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>ironhide</strong>: Will do, Spike.</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.</p>
<p><strong>cliffjumper</strong>: Five…Four…Three…Two…</p>
<p><strong>cliffjumper</strong>: One….</p>
<p><strong>cliffjumper</strong>: Liftoff.</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: Now, all we need is a little Energon and a
lot of luck.</p>
<p><strong>prowl</strong>: Slow down, Ironhide. We want to get to
Autobot city in one piece.</p>
<p><strong>ironhide</strong>: If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can
sure as shootin’ dodge a couple of asteroids.</p>
<p><strong>prowl</strong>: You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>ironhide</strong>: That wasn’t an asteroid. There is a blast
of light and they turn to see…</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Die Autobots!</p>
<p><strong>brawn</strong>: is cut in half by Megatron’s blast.</p>
<p><strong>on prowl</strong>: as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.</p>
<p><strong>the insecticons</strong>: …eat away at the hole in the
shuttle to make way for… …an ARMY of other Decepticons including
Laserbeak who enter, firing.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: This was almost too easy, Starscream.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than
attacking the real threat: the Autobots moon base.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: You’re an idiot, Starscream. Were we
simply to wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another
one.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: But when we slip by their security systems
in their own ship and destroy Autobot city, the Autobots will be
vanquished forever!</p>
<p><strong>ironhide</strong>: Fat chance, Megatron!</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Such heroic nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint
zeta.</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: Daniel, a classic twelve year old
American boy watches the portable viewer which is like an over-sized Boy
Scout compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an old fashioned “fishin’
hole” on Earth - surrounded by weeping willows, assorted trees and
shrubs, and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt, the line
floating lazily out on the water.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Let’s watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As
Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device, hits a button, and watches,
it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it, like a surfer up a steep,
grassy hillside we change angle to feature…</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: an “adolescent” Autobot. He is in robot
mode, sitting with his fishing rod held between two fingers, looking
bored with it all.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Talk about dull……!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Hurry or we’ll miss it!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: lopes up hill after Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: If you’re gonna ride, Dan-O …ride in style!
Hot Rod catches up with Daniel, scoops him off his hoverboard,
TRANSFORMS to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST OF HILL with Daniel
in the front seat.</p>
<p>****: Autobot City looks like a federal energy project gone mad.
Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit every known means of getting
energy. The mountain is covered with solar panels, windmills spin in the
valley, oil derricks pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches
millions of volts. Near all of these various things are energon
compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN THE
BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel truck-type
Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this energon, convert to
humanoid mode, load up their vans, then convert to Auto mode again and
drive the Energon into Autobot City. In short, it should be clear that
the purpose of Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod
and Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up into
neighboring hills for an overview of the -</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Hey! Let me out.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Why settle for a peek when you can see
everything from Lookout Mountain?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: But we’re not supposed to go beyond City
limits!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Chromo-Chicken!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the
mountain.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Cam bustin’, turbo revvin’ young punk.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: This is it! Now take a squint through those
babies.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Hot Rod, look! There’s a hole in the
shuttle!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Decepticons!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: This is for Ironhide. As so’s this!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: He ducks away from the door.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: I’m hit!</p>
<p><strong>the constructicons</strong>: Firing out of the hole.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: He’s furious.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: You imbecile, our cover is blown!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: It was your stupid strategy!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: What’s that darn fool doing? Hound looks up and
points.</p>
<p><strong>hound</strong>: Decepticons!</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Attack!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p>****: WHoooooooaaah</p>
<p><strong>blitzwing</strong>: Come on down, Autobrat!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Yiiiiiiiiii!</p>
<p><strong>on blitzwing</strong>: about to fire, when…</p>
<p><strong>shrapnel</strong>: who is flying nearby.</p>
<p><strong>blitzwing</strong>: transforms to robot mode and turns as…
Kup comes flying, feet first, into Blitzwing knocking him off the
mountain ledge.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Not bad for an old timer!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Old timer?! That’s something you’ll never be if
you don’t get back to the city. You know what we used to do with cocky,
insubordinate upstarts?</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Save it.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: transforming into jet mode, fires on
them with laser bursts which…</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: transforms to humanoid and runs toward……
… Three new Autobots, ARCEE, a lovely female Autobot of about Hot Rod’s
age, SPRINGER, a very muscular and bantering “Indiana Jones” type
Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS, the large and soldierly City Commander.</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Ultra Magnus…..a cursory evaluation of
Decepticon capability indicates a distinct tactical deficit!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: In other words, Perceptor…</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: We’re outnumbered!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Springer, Arcee, transform Autobot
City!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Pathetic fools!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: TRANSFORMS and hovers in robot mode,
firing all around them as they…</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: There’s no escape…Uuuuh! Just then, the
floor of the courtyard STARTS TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the
floor snaps shut like the halves of a gigantic steel shelled clam,
trapping Starscream’s foot.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Agggggggh! My foot!</p>
<p><strong>on megatron</strong>: as he FLIES OVER SCENE, BLASTING this
way and that, shouting</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Breach their defenses!</p>
<p><strong>on insecticons</strong>: who are trailing Megatron, attack
the fast CLOSING CITY, trying to GNAW AND DEVOUR their way through the
PORTS and BRIDGES leading inside.</p>
<p><strong>kickback</strong>: Delicious, eh Shrapnel?</p>
<p><strong>shrapnel</strong>: A little heavy on the electrons.
Electrons.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: The Insecticons are in our way.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Wrong! They’re our way in! Yaaaaaaay-
hah!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hot Rod speeds up, passes Kup and… …
rides up and over Kickback’s back, using it like a stunt driver’s ramp
to…</p>
<p><strong>on shrapnel</strong>: As Shrapnel looks up and reacts… …Kup
hurtles up and over Kickback’s back just as Kickback is starting to rise
to see what knocked him face down onto the bridge in the first place. …
Kup goes SAILING OT OVER OPEN SPACE between Kickback’s back and the
doorway into the city- -clobbering Shrapnel, who is in the way and
landing on the city doorstep, driving in as…</p>
<p><strong>the doorway</strong>: transforms, shutting down with metal
shields with a “clank” sound as Kickback and Shrapnel both leap at is
to… … bite Kup and Hot Rod and instead BREAK THEIR TEETH on steel door,
falling face down with a grunt as LAST BITS OF CITY</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: You can explain your security
violation later, Hot Rod! Now, man your battle station.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I don’t have to explain my so called
violation to you or anyone…</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: He said “later!”</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: Lookout and shout! Yow! Explosions rock the
Crows Nest. Blaster swivels around and tilts to see…</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: activates turret type LASER CANNON</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: Gonna lay some slugs on those overweight
bugs!</p>
<p><strong>cannon swivels</strong>: LASER BLAST cooks out and we FOLLOW
IT OFF SCREEN to…</p>
<p><strong>the insecticons</strong>: as a Laser BLAST hurls Bombshell up
and out of sight and causes Shrapnel and Kickback to get sucked into the
vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: Perceptor joins him.</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: I’m talkin’ hits here, Autobuddies! Hits
with a capital “aitch” like in Hard, Heavy and… Hey, Perceptor, what’s
shakin’ other than this fortress?</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Blaster, Ultra Magnus sends orders to
contact Optimus Prime for reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: Alright! Cover your receptors, Perceptor!
Blaster transforms to ghetto blaster mode and broadcasts VISIBLE
waves…</p>
<p><strong>the waves</strong>: rise and expand into space</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: Optimus Prime… Do you read me? The
Decepticons are blitzing Autobot City. We’re really takin’ a pounding.
Don’t know how much longer we can hold out.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Soundwave! Jam that transmission.</p>
<p><strong>on soundwave</strong>: SOUNDWAVE moves forward and starts
heaving CASSETTES upwards toward Blaster’s Crows Nest position.</p>
<p><strong>soundwave</strong>: Rumble! Frenzy! Ravage! Ratbat! Eject!
Operation: interference.</p>
<p><strong>on cassettes</strong>: as they transform and attack the crows
nest.</p>
<p><strong>on rumble</strong>: as he starts PILE DRIVER MOTION on Crows
Nest windows</p>
<p><strong>rumble</strong>: First we crack the shell. Then we crack the
nuts inside.</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: We got Cassette Critters knockin’ on the
window!</p>
<p><strong>on rumble</strong>: as he CRACKS THROUGH GLASS and he and
others swarm in and attack Perceptor who tries to beat them away</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Run, Blaster! Save yourself!</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: No way. Two can play!</p>
<p><strong>on blaster</strong>: as he spews out CASSETTES which
TRANSFORM into CUBBIE, a lion, STRIPES, a tiger, STINGER, a scorpion and
BOLTS, a small, tough robot.</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: Sic ’em!</p>
<p><strong>on rumble</strong>: as Cubbie takes him down by the foot,
turning him over and over</p>
<p><strong>on stripes</strong>: as he SNAPS at Ratbat who screams and
darts, trying to escape as we move to</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: You think you got through to Prime?</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: Let’s hope so! Cause if I didn’t we’re
gonna look like burnt out toaster ovens!</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Constructicons merge for the kill!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Great! Megatron’s making his big push and
we can’t even push… …back!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help’s at hand!
Together now!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: also leans against it, his small legs
churning.</p>
<p><strong>the catapult</strong>: starts moving easily now.</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Hot Rod. She likes him but</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Hey, I wasn’t worried for a micro-second,
Arcee!</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Then you probably didn’t understand the
situation. Before Hot Rod can react, Kup steps back from repositioned
Catapult</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: That did it!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Kup, Hot Rod! Look!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Devastator!</p>
<p><strong>on devastator</strong>: as he rises up and starts FIRING,
HAMMERING, TEARING AWAY at metal shields which create armored walls of
the transformed City.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: I got better things to do today than
die.</p>
<p><strong>devastator</strong>: and explode harmlessly as Devastator
continues to grunt and tear off armored layers of the city. He grabs Hot
Rod and Kup and starts to crush them.</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Hot Rod!</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Dinobots. Destroy Devastator!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Uhhhh! Me Grimlock love challenge!
Dinobots, transform!</p>
<p><strong>dinobots</strong>: transform into humanoid mode, and, with
Grimlock at the front… …fly out of the shuttle in wedge formation,
blasting in unison.</p>
<p><strong>follow dinobots</strong>: In as they transform again and, in
dino mode, swoop over to Devastator…</p>
<p><strong>devastator</strong>: Roars towards the Dinobots.</p>
<p><strong>their battle</strong>: shakes the Earth…</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: Megatron must be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: No matter the cost.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: as he commands his troops.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Their defenses are broken. Let the
slaughter begin.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Prime!?</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: smashing through a wall of lesser
Decepticons.</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: One shall stand, one shall fall.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Why throw away your life so
recklessly?</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: That’s a question you should ask
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: hurls himself at Optimus Prime… …. both
tumble into the walls of the City… …denting the walls and causing the
electronic panels inside to short circuit, surrounding them with a fiery
nimbus of crackling electrical energy.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: We’ve got to save Prime! Punching…</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: That’s his fight, lad! Stay away.
Shooting..</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: grabs a jagged, spearlike piece of steel
and hurls it at</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: The steel “spear” pierces his side and sticks
in him as… … he charges Megatron, …dodging shots from Megatron’s gun to…
…deliver a huge UPPERCUT which… …lifts Megatron into the air so high
that… …</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: his head butts sharply against overhanging
concrete balcony, mashing him down…</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger
from his boot, turning and slashing at…</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: as he comes for him, tearing… …a gash across
Prime’s midsection, which spews smoke and sparks and…</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Farewell, Prime!</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: as he lifts chunks of broken concrete
and catches the laser dagger on it, tossing it aside as he lunges
at-</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: who claws his fingers and digs them into
Prime’s eyes</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: I’ll rip out your optics! Optimus grabs
Megatron’s clawed hand in one of his hands, twists it in see-sawing test
of strength which… Optimus wins in a judo toss which sends Megatron - -
skidding face first through steel rubble, in a shower of sparks until he
crashes into the side of the city.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: That’s showing him, Optimus!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: knocks two Decepticons on their tails and
turns.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Finish him off, Prime! Do it now!</p>
<p><strong>on megatron</strong>: as he spots a gun on the ground ahead
of him</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: No more, Optimus Prime! Grant me mercy, I
beg of you!</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: You who are without mercy now plead
for it. I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Megatron!</p>
<p><strong>prime</strong>: Out of the way, Hot Rod.</p>
<p><strong>on megatron</strong>: firing blaster again and again</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Fall! Fall!</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: I would have waited an eternity for this.
Crawl, slave! On your knees!</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Optimus! Forgive me!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: How do you feel, Mighty Megatron?</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Enshrine me!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Take this scrap to Cybertron!
Astrotrain, transform and get us out of here!</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: The Decepticons are retreating.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Prime did it. He turned the tide! He shoots
into…</p>
<p><strong>the autobots</strong>: fire after them, closing ranks on the
shuttle, and pouring shots into the melee.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Astrotrain, take off.</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: as he lies on an improvised bier-like
platform, a profusion of electricity discharging tubes and “plasma”
bottle devices hooked up to his arms and into his gaping middle
wound.</p>
<p><strong>scanners</strong>: emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic
patterns but sounds and wave patterns are steadily growing weaker and
weaker.</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: is bent over Prime, in microscope mode,
examining him… He then transforms and straightens up, his voice strained
and cracking with emotion.</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: I fear the wounds are…</p>
<p><strong>intercut to hot rod, kup, arcee, daniel</strong>: AND OTHER
AUTOBOTS as they react.</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Autobots…do not grieve… Soon, I shall
be one with the matrix.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Prime!</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Ultra Magnus! It is to you, old
friend, I shall pass the matrix as it was passed to me ….</p>
<p><strong>magnus</strong>: Prime, I’m just a soldier. I’m not
worthy.</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Nor was I, but one day, an Autobot
shall rise from our ranks and use the powers of the Matrix to light our
darkest hour.</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Until that day…</p>
<p><strong>astrotrain</strong>: Jettison some weight, or I’ll never make
it to Cybertron.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has
requested that we lighten our burden!</p>
<p><strong>bonecrusher</strong>: In that case, I say it’s survival of
the fittest.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: So I hear a second on that?</p>
<p><strong>healthy decepticons</strong>: Aye!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: And against?</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: The ayes’ have it!</p>
<p>****: Beat it! Spare me!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Oh, how it grieves me to do this.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Wait, I still function!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say
- departed. I nominate myself as the new leader.</p>
<p><strong>scrapper</strong>: The Constructicons form Devastator, the
most powerful robot. We should rule.</p>
<p><strong>soundwave</strong>: Constructicons inferior. Soundwave
superior.</p>
<p><strong>bonecrusher</strong>: Who are you calling inferior.</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: Nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like
you.</p>
<p><strong>rumble</strong>: Hey, nobody calls Soundwave uncrazmatic.</p>
<p><strong>frenzy</strong>: Yeah! Let’s kick tailgate.</p>
<p><strong>the constructicons</strong>: try to form Devastator, but…</p>
<p><strong>hook</strong>: Constructicons, unite!</p>
<p><strong>rumble/frenzy</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>blitzwing</strong>: I am a triple changer. I am worth any two
of you. I should run things.</p>
<p><strong>dirge</strong>: Death comes to anyone who crosses me. He
attacks Blitzwing.</p>
<p><strong>astrotrain</strong>: Stop squabbling or we’re gonna
crash.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Welcome, Megatron.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: I am Unicron.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Show yourself!</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: I have summoned you here for a purpose.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Nobody summons Megatron!</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Then it pleases me to be the first.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: State your business.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Bring me the Autobot Matrix. It is the one
thing - the only thing that can stand in my way.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: You have nothing to fear. I have already
crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: You exaggerate.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: The point is, he is dead! And the Matrix
died with him.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: No. It has been passed to their new leader.
Get it for me.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: Why should I? What’s in it for me?</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Your bargaining posture is highly dubious,
but very well, I will provide you with a new body, and new troops to
command.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: And nothing.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: I belong to nobody.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Perhaps I misjudged you. Proceed on your
way to oblivion. The Mist appears and starts to dissolve Megatron.</p>
<p><strong>megatron</strong>: No, no. I accept your terms. I accept!</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Excellent! Behold - Galvatron! X-ray
images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on and off as a new and larger
being starts to form, changing from dented Megatron to a huge, new
creation: Galvatron.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Long live Galvatron!</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: And these shall be your minions…</p>
<p><strong>scourge</strong>: SCOURGE is bearded, fanged and ferocious
looking and as soon as he has been CREATED, he roars and stretches and
an ARRAY OF SIMILAR CREATURES - smaller and all wearing dark and
matching uniforms - are INSTANTLY CREATED FROM OTHERS behind him</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Scourge, the tracker….and his huntsmen…the
Sweeps….</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Cyclonus, the warrior…and his armada…..</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: To Cybertron!</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Bring me the Autobot matrix! DURING
UNICRON’S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: I will rip open Autobot after Autobot
until it is yours, Unicron.</p>
<p><strong>other decepticons</strong>: in neat ranks but their grim
expressions show their displeasure.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Get on with the ceremony! Dirge and
others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up and off. Starscream looks where
others are looking and reacts.</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Who disrupts my coronation?</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Coronation? This is bad comedy!</p>
<p><strong>starscream</strong>: Megatron, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Here’s a clue!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: He transforms back to robot mode and
confronts other Decepticons boastfully.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Will anyone else attempt to fill his
shoes?</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Galvatron.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Bit by bit, we see new sections of the
planet being generated. Then, the sinister mist we saw at the beginning
of the film starts pouring out.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: A strange, LOUD HUM fills the air and the
ground heaves and SHAKES beneath their feet</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Where’d that come from?!</p>
<p><strong>cliffjumper</strong>: Who cares? I’m more worried about where
it’s going!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Talk to me, Earth! We got a situation out
here!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Roger me. Wilco me. Anything? Hello. Hello
Earth.</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: He reacts to muffled transmission from
Jazz.</p>
<p><strong>blaster</strong>: I’m pickin’ up a faint signal! BLASTER
TRANSFORMS to blaster mode and Jazz’s VOICE is broadcast loud and clear
causing Springer, Arcee, and Daniel to react</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: This is Jazz. I gi-normous weird lookin’
planet just showed up in the suburbs of Cybertron….</p>
<p><strong>cliffjumper</strong>: And it’s attack…</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Jazz! Cliffjumper!</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Got …to….blast free….if we can….. They get in
and start retro blasters, the flame of blasters whirling in wild winds
as moon is engulfed.</p>
<p><strong>cliffjumper</strong>: Ignition and….</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Hit it!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Suddenly it is pulled deep into
Unicron.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: How dare Unicron?! Cybertron and all it’s
moons are mine!</p>
<p><strong>scourge</strong>: But remember, WE belong to HIM!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: I….will obey, Unicron! Decepticons, to
Earth! The torture stops and Galvatron clutches his throat and tries to
regain his composure as we…</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: It’s like a terrible nightmare, Ultra
Magnus.</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: This thing - this juggernaut just ripped
the first moon to shreds.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: And it’s heading this way.</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: We’ll try ’n slow it down…</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: But you’d better get here fast because…
Suddenly, static obscures the transmission.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Autobots, prepare to board the
shuttles. This new menace is more dangerous than all the Decepticons put
together. Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: But what about my dad? He’s on the moon
between that monster and Cybertron.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Daniel, I’ll do everything I can for
Spike.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: And what are we going to do when we get
there? If that thing crunches moons, it’ll make short work of us.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Maybe the Matrix can stop it.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: You’re right! It can.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: What do you know about it lad?</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: It’s just a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: To the shuttles!!!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: There is no escape. I, Galvatron will
crush you just as the magnificent Megatron crushed Prime!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: And you’ll die trying just like
Megatron! Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits Galvatron.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: aaaaaaaah! Autobot cur!!</p>
<p><strong>cyclonus</strong>: You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for
you?</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: There are plenty of Autobots for you.
Ultra Magnus is mine!</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Stay close to me, Daniel…</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: And you better stay close to me… Arcee
pulls Hot Rod toward her before he gets hit by laser</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: No, you’d better stay close to me. Blurr is
trying to get Grimlock into Shuttle with the rest of the Dinobots as
Decepticon FIRE COMES IN ALL AROUND. Grimlock is like a “spooked horse”
refusing to be shut in the barn.</p>
<p><strong>blurr</strong>: him, talking very, very</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock, not “nice Dino!” Me bash
brains!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: He gives FIRE BREATHING BLAST AT JETS as
they go by STRAFING THE</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: as Kup, Hot Rod and Arcee MOVE INTO
SCENE</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Kup, Hot Rod. Get the Dinobots out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>on scourge</strong>: as he TRANSFORMS to Humanoid mode and
shouts orders, FIRING AT Blurr who BLURRS PAST and then at Arcee who
also SHIPS BY</p>
<p><strong>scourge</strong>: No survivors!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9, when
the Petro-Rabbits were… Grimlock, get your noodle out of my face!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock, love Kup’s war stories!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: You’re living one now! Engage the boosters for
Cybertron’s sake! Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand over bank of
SWITCHES all of which GLOW AND PULSE with the action.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as DECEPTICON FIREBALL COMES UP and
SPLATTERS AGAINST WINDOW, sending tongues of fire running across the
glass behind Hot Rod’s head</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: You got ’em!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Tell Grimlock about Petro-Rabbits
again.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: I’ll give you Petro-Rabbits. Contact! The
Shuttle lurches and shakes</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Yaaaaaaaaho! We’re airborne!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Groooooowwwwwrrrr!</p>
<p><strong>cyclonus</strong>: Vaporize them!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Looks like we’re shipmates, squirt!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: All right!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: But if you get space sick, you’re gonna
walk home.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Jump.</p>
<p><strong>on arcee</strong>: still going up the ramp while the shuttle
slowly leaves the ground.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: That was close!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Believe it or not, this is the fun
part.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: No time to preheat….Can this ship take
it?</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: With an accelerated ignition procedure
the ceramic housings might create a magnetic flux.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: He says “go for it!”</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: gives the thumbs up gesture.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: INCLUDING Ultra Magnus’ shuttle
through side port as Springer gives thumbs up signal in return and
Daniel waves</p>
<p><strong>on springer</strong>: as he turns and reacts, looking
straight up and ahead</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: It ought to be smooth sailin’ from here on
in.</p>
<p><strong>astrotrain</strong>: Fuse them!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Ultra Magnus…what next?</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Remember what we did off Beta
Four!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: I remember it well.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron’s ships</strong>: which swerve to avoid them
as….</p>
<p><strong>galvatron’s ship</strong>: emerges from the chaos.</p>
<p><strong>cyclonus</strong>: The explosions jammed my sensors. I have
lost track of the Autobots!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Damn it!! They did the same thing to me
off Beta four!</p>
<p><strong>shuttle</strong>: Possible song - optimistic adventure with
the suggestion that all dreams might not happen.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Congratulations Autobots, we’ve lost
’em at least for a while. So rest up. We’ll refuel on the Junk Planet
and work out our battle plan there.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Yep, I remember the dust was so thick off Beta
4 had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors….</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock, know all about wipers! Want
to hear good part of story!</p>
<p><strong>swoop</strong>: Good part, Kup! Tell Swoop good part!</p>
<p><strong>slag</strong>: Good part…tell</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Okay, Okay. The dust was really thick and then
this gigantic Ick Yak…</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Don’t you think we have better things to do
now than tell stories Kup?</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Like maybe figure out how we’re gonna stay
alive.</p>
<p>****: As he is speaking, Auto-Combatant “sees” its opening and gives
Hot Rod a swift kick in the rear, sending him flying</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Time out, for Cybertron’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>auto combatant</strong>: Time out, time out, time out!
Suddenly, the shuttle rocks from impact and SPARKS and flames shoot out
of large hole in wall</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Kup! Raise your force fields at once!
They’re armed with…..</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Moleculon Missiles!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: They’re closing on us!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Yeah, how’d you beat them?</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: I’m trying to remember…there were an awful lot
of casualties that day…</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Oh yeah, we inversed polarities.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: That’ll tear the ship apart!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: You got a better idea?!! With that, the ship
seems to stop, on a dime, in mid air! The missiles zoom past it.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Okay, so you were right.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Don’t run your programs until they’re
debugged.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: They’re coming back.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Let’s just hope we’ve screwed up their
trajectories.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Whew!!!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Yep, I thought we’d had it that time for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Dive!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: crushing the area between Hot Rod and
Kup.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Kup and Hot Rod just bought it!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: I can’t deal with that now.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Face it, Magnus, the Decepticons ’re gonna
dog us until they see us dead! Ultra Magnus nods solemnly</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Then that’s exactly what they’re gonna
see.</p>
<p><strong>on galvatron</strong>: as he works controls which eject more
Moleculon Missiles.</p>
<p><strong>cyclonus</strong>: The Autobots have been terminated!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Excellent. And soon we shall say the same
of that infernal Unicron. Suddenly, Galvatron’s body begins to twist,
and he writhes in pain.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Aaaah! Take me to Unicron…Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Did we have to detonate three- quarters of
the ship?!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Seeing how they would have detonated four
quarters, I think it was a good choice.</p>
<p><strong>sudden shudder and the ship drops</strong>: SHARPLY, all
holding on to each other and to any protruding handhold</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Perceptor….can you still locate the
Junk Planet?</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Gamma waves in this sector of space
create marginal navigation probabilities, however…..</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Holds his head in his hands as
Springer grimaces</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Ahem…..yes I think I can.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: still cartwheeling down toward the planet
below, trying to change the angle of his fall</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Kup….Grimlock? Slag!….Anybody? WE FOLLOW
him through undersea world as he rounds a “corner” of the Reef Wall and
reacts</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Kup!</p>
<p><strong>the squid</strong>: angrily streaks toward Hot Rod.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Fires at the Squid, but not stopping
him.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hot Rod’s shot plinks off a couple of
tentacles, but the squid keeps coming…</p>
<p><strong>the squid</strong>: releases a laser print ink stream which
boils out in the water in a series of dots and “x” shapes and
retreats.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m not coming after you.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: lowers his head and blows blast of air
through head-piece. The air blast clears the water, revealing Kup’s head
and torso half buried in the “sand”</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Kup! Say something!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Fix me!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Sure, Kup….right away! Hot Rod rapidly</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Well…what do you think? Kup feels his elbow
joint, twists his neck side to side and gets creaks and squeaks and
moves legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying himself out.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: There’s a piece missing.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: No way…. See, this wasn’t yours…it’s some
kind of prehistoric ion cruncher….and this doohickey looks like a funky
energon funnel… and this…</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: arms and hands, CREAKING,</p>
<p>****: Well, I still think I’m short a part! But all things
considered, you did an amazing job, lad! Amazing!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on my
rotator! Now, let’s find the Dinos and get off this twisted planet!</p>
<p><strong>on kup</strong>: as he transforms it’s evident that a fender
is misplaced and a wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides
unevenly with much chugging and oil spewing</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Of all the circuit glitched diode blowin’
dim-wittery… I told you a part was missin’.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Don’t act hostile. I’ll use the universal
greeting.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Universal Greeting.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Watch. I’ll have them eating out of my
hand.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Or our faces.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong…</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong… The
Sharkticons look interested.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: See, the Universal Greeting works every time.
Now, without making any sudden moves, give them an Energon goody. Kup
reaches into his belt, presses a button and pulls out an Energon cube.
Hot Rod, somewhat suspicious of the whole process does the came.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: This is getting expensive.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Don’t worry, they’ll reciprocate. They each
hand out three Energon goodies to the remaining six Sharkticons… The
Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they back off, eyeing the two
Autobots with menace.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I thought they were supposed to
reciprocate.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Customs vary from place to place. Suddenly, the
Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them.</p>
<p><strong>the quintessons</strong>: slender, spindly framed robotic
creatures with oversized five sided heads, each side bearing a different
mechanistic face with a different expression on each - smiling, angry,
grimacing, suspicious and the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As Hot
Rod and Kup are led to certain death in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh,
dissonant, metallic and terrifying music plays, underscoring the brutal
evil they face,</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on
Golgonath Seven….</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Every place reminds you of some place
else…..</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Experience, lad. You should learn to appreciate
it.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: A lot of good it’s done us so far!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I can’t transform!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: They’re restraining bolts, lad.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: We got to get a new travel agent…. What is
this place?</p>
<p><strong>kranix</strong>: The world of the savage Sharkticons and
their cruel masters the Quintessons. They hunt down those who try to
escape the wrath of Unicron, and put them on trial.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: But what if they’re innocent?</p>
<p><strong>kranix</strong>: Guilty or innocent, the sentence is always
the same - death!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Unicron?! Who’s Unicron?</p>
<p><strong>kranix</strong>: A planet six times the size of this one that
absorbs everything in its path.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: So that’s the monster’s name.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I wonder if there’s any connection between
it and Galvatron.</p>
<p><strong>quintesson guard</strong>: That one!</p>
<p><strong>quintesson guard</strong>: Soon, you too shall receive your
sentence.</p>
<p><strong>lead quintesson</strong>: Jury, have you reached a
verdict?</p>
<p><strong>juror #1</strong>: We have your honor.</p>
<p><strong>lead quintesson</strong>: Guilty…..Or innocent. I repeat.</p>
<p><strong>kranix</strong>: Spare me this mockery of justice.</p>
<p><strong>lead quintesson</strong>: I repeat, guilty…or innocent.</p>
<p><strong>jurors</strong>: Guilty!!</p>
<p><strong>granix {note</strong>: Yet another, final, reference to
Kranix as Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming
Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy. In moments, he is no more.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Not the end I’d wish for, lad.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Where are we, Springer?</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: The place where everything ends up after
you throw it out.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Brace for impact!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise…
Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and
dust off his shoulders</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Wow! That was better’n the Roller Coaster at
Future World!</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: The composition of this planet seems to
be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non-ferrous
articulations.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p>****: He says the planet’s made of junk.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Yep, this dump is a dump……</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: as he straps on TOOL BELT</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: We might be able to salvage this
thing. Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by Blurr who takes up a saw
and tool belt and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans as Daniel moves
out to join them</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Can I help, too?</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: It’s rough out there, kid. Stay inside and
play with crayons or something.</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: as she steps forward with a smile, a strange
GRID LIKE “SUIT” in her hand</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: I think Daniel can make himself useful
with….this! It used to be Spike’s.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Wow! Dad’s exo-suit. He told me about it but
I never saw it.</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Here, try it on.</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: as he gets inside the “suit” which fits
over his body like a grid-work metal “cage.”</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Just think about what you want to do
before you do it!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: brows knitted, thinking.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Don’t fight it Dan-O.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: It’s kind of tricky….</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: For the first time out, you were great!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Show time’s over! We’ve got work to
do!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: This must be the junk capital of the
universe!</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Stop thief! No welcome-wagon, “hello
stranger!” that good coffee flavor</p>
<p><strong>other junkions</strong>: Yeah, or your money back! Wreck-Gar
shows large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor sharp fins and rusty little
rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer like barrel</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Operators are standing by! They laugh in
guttural, clanking sounds and look out at Springer and the others who
keep working as we</p>
<p><strong>quintesson</strong>: Greetings, noble strangers.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock
search for friends.</p>
<p><strong>quintesson</strong>: And who might they be?</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Autobots. Hot Rod and Kup.</p>
<p><strong>quintesson</strong>: Oh yes. A young one and an old one.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Yes. You know friends. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>quintesson</strong>: They went down that path. He points
to…</p>
<p><strong>a path</strong>: It probably isn’t lined with primroses, but
it should be.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock. I
reward you, sometime.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Why do you torture me?!</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: You have failed.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Then where is the matrix?</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Destroyed, with him.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: The matrix can not be destroyed. And Ultra
Magnus lives on the planet of Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And bring
the matrix to me.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup
close! Get thump, thump, thump…</p>
<p><strong>slag</strong>: Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony.
He is just about to fall in when…</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium
salami! Slag gets up…</p>
<p><strong>slag</strong>: Beryllium balony!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Argh!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap
model.</p>
<p><strong>slag</strong>: Like your head! Grimlock jumps on Slag and
wrestles him to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE
speaks from o.s.</p>
<p><strong>squeaky voice</strong>: Friends find. Look behind.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Who say that?</p>
<p><strong>wheelie</strong>: Friends find. Look behind. Many Face lie.
You fool! You buy!</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock, “fool?”</p>
<p><strong>wheelie</strong>: Picture you got. Now fool you not! Grimlock
raises a claw to swipe Wheelie off Slag’s head</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock, no like you!</p>
<p><strong>on wheelie</strong>: as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE
IN SLING and slings it onto Grimlock’s nose where it EXPLODES making
Grimlock yowl and pull back, feeling his reddened nose and speaking
through his nose angrily</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Doooooooow! Why boy hit by dose?</p>
<p><strong>wheelie</strong>: Wheelie say, find friends today! Grimlock
and Slag react as we</p>
<p><strong>quintesson judge</strong>: Before we deliver your verdict,
would you like to beg for your lives?</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Remember when you put me together today?</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Sure, that’s all I got to think about.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: I know what part you forgot.</p>
<p><strong>quintesson judge</strong>: Silence or I’ll hold you in
contempt of this court.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I have nothing but contempt for this
court.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder
socket. Watch this, lad… without it, I’m double jointed as Houdini.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Wish you’d figured that out a little
sooner.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Better late than never!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: They’ve got more Sharkticons than we have
photon charges!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Let’s hold a demolition derby! Then, he roars
into a bunch of them, slamming a massive stack into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Didn’t even bend a fender.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Yeah, but look. There are a lot more of those
cam dinging, grill-crackin’ things.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: We can’t hold out forever, but we can give
them one whopper of a repair bill.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller
Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he’s a second
stringer, and scampers away.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag
barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of them,
while…</p>
<p><strong>the sharkticons</strong>: suddenly back off and begin
transforming to the dinobots.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I never thought I’d be so happy to see
those big bozos.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me Grimlock no bozo. Me king!</p>
<p><strong>quintesson judge</strong>: Sharkticons! Execute them.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me Grimlock say execute them.</p>
<p><strong>the sharkticons</strong>: for a brief instant, don’t seem to
know what to do. Then, they charge the Quintessons.</p>
<p><strong>the chase</strong>: The Quintessons start to flee, but it’s
clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other
Sharkticons, are going to catch them.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: I think the problems on this planet will be
solved very shortly.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: But what about our problems. We need a
ship.</p>
<p><strong>wheelie</strong>: WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Who are you.</p>
<p><strong>slag</strong>: Him Wheelie, him friend.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: HOT ROD He’ll be mine too, if he can find a
Quintesson ship.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: That’s a ship?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: If this doesn’t do it, nothing will.</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: now with a new bumpersticker which is a
Unicron with a red circle and slash through it, looks very fidgety.</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>the spaceship</strong>: takes off.</p>
<p><strong>on unicron</strong>: His mist surrounds the planet…</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: Five, four, three, two, one…</p>
<p><strong>bumblebee</strong>: It isn’t even dented.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>on unicron</strong>: The great Maw opens and we hear a grand
cosmic roar! Suddenly, the smoke and space junk from the explosion are
sucked into his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: We’re being sucked into it!</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Be sure the fittings are securely
welded!</p>
<p><strong>blurr</strong>: Absolutely, positively, definitely…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: This exo-suit is fantastic! Want me to do
that?</p>
<p><strong>blurr</strong>: Weld? You? Really? Well, why not? Give it a
try, but think it through first! Daniel knits his brow, extends FINGER
OF EXO- GLOVE which is part of exo-suit.</p>
<p><strong>blurr</strong>: Practice, practice, practice!</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Forward, avanti, apfel and like, go for
gusto….</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Hang on, this be industrial strength We
watch…</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: as he, too, hears and then looks up
and sees the Decepticon force</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Decepticons! We’ve got to draw them
off and then double back to the ship!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Cancel that last order.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>blurr</strong>: Transform! You can do… …it!</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: as he reacts, looks around, thinks, brows
knitting, looking off, reacting</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Transform….</p>
<p><strong>on scavenger</strong>: as he starts reaching for Daniel</p>
<p><strong>scavenger</strong>: Human germ!</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: as his Exo-Suit SUDDENLY TRANSFORMS INTO
auto mode and takes off and drives through…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Wooooh!!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: flies up to a ridge in advance of his
forces, motioning to them to split off and follow…</p>
<p><strong>sweep</strong>: He lets out a rayblast…</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Perceptor!</p>
<p><strong>on perceptor</strong>: He transforms to humanoid mode.</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: It appears that my lacerations were
primarily superficial.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Then move it…</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Stays behind, taking a few shots
at…</p>
<p><strong>sweeps</strong>: which streak over in deadly formations.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: He stands and shoots.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Ultra Magnus!</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Your estimated survival time is 10
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Then use that time to escape! The
Matrix was designed for an emergency like this. I’ll try to unleash its
power.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: But what if it doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Until all are one!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Damn it! Open it!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: Prime, you said the Matrix would light
our darkest hour.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Sweeps, quarter him!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Unicron, my “master,” with this I shall
make you my slave!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: as he moves out and looks down at Ultra
Magnus’ remains</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Ultra Magnus!</p>
<p><strong>blurr</strong>: Without the Matrix there is no hope. No hope
at all!</p>
<p><strong>on wreck-gar</strong>: as he roars into the lead and shows
his teeth</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Don’t look behind door number two, Monty.
It’s time to play End-of-the-line-my valentine!
Geroni-roni-doo-ron-ron-i-mo!</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Get gone!</p>
<p><strong>a junkion</strong>: roars alongside Springer on his
motorcycle and throws out laser barbed grappling hook, trying to hook
Springer. Springer ducks first pass of hook.</p>
<p><strong>on junkion</strong>: as he hurls GRAPPLING HOOK AGAIN</p>
<p><strong>on springer</strong>: as he catches HOOK BY THE CHAIN AND
YANKS</p>
<p><strong>the junkion</strong>: goes flying off his motorcycle.,, He
transforms into a motorcycle as The motorcycle transforms into a rider
and hops on the new motorcycle and then…</p>
<p><strong>on springer</strong>: He looks over, astonished.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: It’s not hard to knock ’em down. It’s
getting them to stay down that’s the trick.</p>
<p><strong>on arcee</strong>: as she fires at a Junkion who is trying to
swerve her off the road knocking him off the motorcycle… The Junkion
looks down at his missing arm, digs around in the junk for a minute,
comes up with another, and then transforms to a motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as Junkion rides over to her, starts
belting her with junk sword</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: They’re indestructible!</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: as he skids, stopping his Exo-Suit as he
reacts to what’s ahead</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: They’re everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>on springer</strong>: as he stops and Arcee, Daniel,
Perceptor and Blurr stop around him. They close ranks and look out at
the Junkions grimly</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Perhaps they’re not as vicious as they
look.</p>
<p><strong>on wreck-gar</strong>: as he gnashes his teeth and grins and
then BLINKS HIS EYES which roll to show eyes like ping pong balls.
Wreck-Gar makes blipping noises as he does this</p>
<p><strong>on springer</strong>: reacting to Wreck-Gar’s noises and
eyeball display</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Positive thinking gets on my nerves.
Suddenly, all react to sound and wind of passing space cruiser their
P.O.V- HOT ROD, KUP AND DINOBOTS IN CRUISER as it shoots past and banks,
coming back for a closer look</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: It can’t be….it’s…..Hot Rod! He’s
alive!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: as he looks up at passing Cruiser and
waves</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: And Kup and the Dinobots! We’re saved!</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: I wouldn’t count on that!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero have I
seen such a sight….</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Maybe they make me king, too!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Don’t hold your breath, your majesty.</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: as he watches Cruiser descend and start
gliding in for a landing</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Steady as she goes, mob! Snoopy visitors
get mud in the eye bye and bye, and film at five!</p>
<p><strong>junkions</strong>: Everything must go by midnight! With a
SINGING ROAR of musical, tribal excitement, the Junkions sweep Springer
and our friends along with them, following course of landing Cruiser
to</p>
<p><strong>on doorway</strong>: as Hot Rod steps out with big smile and
hand full of energon sticks followed by a very wary Kup, and the
Dinobots with Wheelie riding Sludge’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Guns aren’t exactly friendly.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Neither are they in case you haven’t
noticed.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: What was the Universal greeting again?</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: growls and slips a SNIPPER, BLOW TORCH
CUTTING TOOL out of a holster and starts toward Hot Rod with it</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: As Hot Rod says this…</p>
<p><strong>everybody</strong>: Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong Bah
weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong! Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni
bong….</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: hugs Hot Rod, and Perceptor who winces
and tries to enjoy it, and then hugs Daniel, Wheelie, Arcee, laughing
and dancing as SINGING goes.</p>
<p><strong>on grimlock</strong>: as he reacts to Wreck-Gar kissing his
leg</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Yuck! Me Grimlock, not a kisser! Me,
Grimlock, a king!</p>
<p><strong>wheelie</strong>: claps his hands and gleefully makes noises
as he hops about, dancing with Junkions until we CUT TO</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: as he stands on top of platform and RINGS
JUNK BELLS AND SIRENS getting silence and smiling as he waves hands all
around</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Have a nice day and please, close cover
before striking, friends! Amigos, buddies and side kicks, Breep drit, aw
rootie! So say the Junkions!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Where did you learn to talk like that?</p>
<p><strong>the watchman</strong>: On it is a crazy Eddy-type
commercial.</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: We talk T.V. You talk some T.V.?</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: looks around nervously.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: I talk some TV. And now, Hot Rod for the news.
Don’t touch that dial. Void where prohibited. JUNKIONS cheer wildly
while the Dinobots react with uncertainty</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: By George kimosabes your smashed up,
blotto friend, soon like brand new with ninety day warranty all iciban
parts and labor is!</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Happy motoring! Cock-a-doodle-do!</p>
<p><strong>springer and others</strong>: Ultra Magnus!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: You’re all alive…</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: The matrix!</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: It’s gone…</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: And with it, all hope.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: No… The matrix will not fail us.</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Didn’t you hear Ultra Magnus. We don’t have
it anymore. Galvatron does.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Then we’ve got to trust in ourselves, and
no matter what they odds, destroy Unicron.</p>
<p><strong>on wreck-gar</strong>: His eyes light up.</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Yeah! Destroy Unicron… Kill the grand
poobah…. Flush cosmic troubles down the drain.</p>
<p><strong>junkions</strong>: Destroy Unicron… Kill the grand poobah…
Flush cosmic troubles down the drain.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Listen, I don’t want to rain on anybody’s
parade, but how are we going to move the army to Unicron. We don’t have
enough room on that ship.</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: No fuss, no muss. Hurry, hurry. Sale must
end! Rush right on down to bridge and test drive latest with no
obligation.</p>
<p><strong>ultra magnus</strong>: You have ships here?</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek
sexy import with turbo handling.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: This is what I call traveling in
style.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Listen to me, or suffer the
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Aren’t we getting pompous?</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: I now possess that which you most fear.
Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks the surface of the planet,
knocking Galvatron to his knees.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: You will do my bidding, or… Unicron roars
with laughter.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: …taste my wrath.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: You underestimate me Galvatron.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: For a time, I considered sparing your
measly little planet, but now you shall witness its dismemberment!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>shockwave</strong>: Decepticons…we’re under attack…Scramble -
Then his voice is cut off as…</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: GALVATRON Stop feeding him, you
fools!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Doesn’t it remind you of something,
Kup?</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Nope, never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: I knew there had to be a first time….
Battle stations!</p>
<p><strong>unicron’s chest</strong>: Galvatron, the matrix hanging
around his neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up at… … A bright panel
on Unicron’s chest…</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Patented enamel resists fire, rain and
corrosion. Five year warranty, satisfaction guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>other junkions</strong>: Or your money back!</p>
<p><strong>closer</strong>: … tears it in half.</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Unshakable, unbreakable, unbeatable. And
for a limited time we include…</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Free bonus surprise!</p>
<p><strong>junkions</strong>: Free bonus surprise!</p>
<p><strong>perceptor</strong>: Most unscientific, but… effective.</p>
<p><strong>the cruiser</strong>: Is suddenly struck by a ray from
Unicron’s eye, and half of it is knocked off.</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Graaaaaaaaaaa!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Where’s Hot Rod?</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Sees something in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: I don’t know, but I hope they didn’t get
him.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: Debugoids!</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Quick! This way.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: The Autobot Matrix!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: It will do you no good, Autobot. It
cannot be opened.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Not by a Decepticon.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: It is strange that we should find
ourselves as allies…</p>
<p><strong>on galvatron</strong>: Suddenly, his body is violently
twisted, and his arms are almost broken off.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Uhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>unicron</strong>: Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from
limb to limb.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Of course, my master!</p>
<p><strong>on galvatron</strong>: He peers into the gloom.</p>
<p><strong>on galvatron</strong>: Weapon drawn.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime’s
courage. There is no response.</p>
<p><strong>assorted shots</strong>: Unicron now stands atop Cybertron,
fighting the various ships that swarm around him like bees. … Rays
streak from his one good eye. …</p>
<p><strong>assorted shots</strong>: His hands smash fighters… … Fire
shoots from his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>the dinobots</strong>: Now reaching Unicron’s butt, start
kicking.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me Grimlock kick Butt.</p>
<p><strong>grimlock</strong>: Me, Grimlock, need new strategy.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: He looks o.s. towards the others.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Help…</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Daniel!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I’m okay. They don’t even see me.</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: They must not programmed to catch flesh
creatures.</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: Us, on the other hand…</p>
<p><strong>arcee</strong>: Daniel… Try to find help! Arcee fires…</p>
<p><strong>unicron’s stomach</strong>: This is the central processing
area for Unicron’s “food” and “energy.” A long conveyer belt drops junk
into a clear, bubbling vat, where it is separated into raw material and
energy. The energy, which comes out in raw form, goes into a machine and
is crunched into energon cubes, while the solid material, is separated
into it’s component metals and plastics, formed into ingots and sent
elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: watches this with awe until he sees…</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: He dashes to the shores of the glowing
lake…</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Cliffjumper! Jazz!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Bumblebee! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Shut off the control, Daniel. Daniel looks
around.</p>
<p><strong>a control</strong>: .. which controls the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>on daniel</strong>: He runs up a catwalk towards it….</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What do I do? It doesn’t have any buttons or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Shoot it, Son.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: But I don’t have a gun.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Use your exo-suit.</p>
<p><strong>cliffjumper</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Starts frying the command console!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I can’t stop it!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: turns around and sees this.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Son.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: You did it!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Come out, Autobot. We all must die
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: stumbles backward.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot
Rod transforms back to car and tries to race away… … Galvatron jumps
after him and catches him… … Hot Rod, nearly pinned by Galvatron
transforms to humanoid mode.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now
you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily or I might have a sense of
satisfaction now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls at Galvatron’s
hands…</p>
<p><strong>wreck-gar</strong>: Ashes to ashes. Junk to junk.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Gasps.</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Die!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead,
spring to life for a moment and grasp the Matrix which hangs from
Galvatron’s chest.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: A miraculous transformation takes
place. … Hot Rod begins to grow at an alarming rate. … Age shows on his
face. … He is stronger and wiser.</p>
<p><strong>optimus prime</strong>: Arise, Rodimus Prime.</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: Optimus!</p>
<p><strong>galvatron</strong>: Nooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>hot rod</strong>: This is the end of the road, Galvatron.
With that, he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through…</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: I’m almost out of energy. Suddenly, he
looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above</p>
<p><strong>springer</strong>: That’s what I call the nick of time.</p>
<p><strong>jazz</strong>: Let’s burn rubber!</p>
<p><strong>kup</strong>: I knew you had potential, lad!</p>
<p><strong>rodimus prime</strong>: Autobots, transform and roll out.
Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots also
transform. Daniel and Spike jump into him. Then, in a continuous line,
he shoots off, the other Autobots racing behind him.</p>
<p><strong>rodimus prime</strong>: Let this mark the end of the
Cybertronian wars as we move forward to a new age of peace and
happiness….</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Until all are one!</p>
