<h1 id="trainspotting">trainspotting</h1>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Legs run along the pavement. They
are Mark Renton’s.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career.
Choose a family, Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing
machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat room. day</strong>: In a bare, dingy
room, Renton lies on the floor, alone, motionless and drugged.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Choose good health, low cholesterol and
dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a
starter home. Choose your friends.</p>
<p><strong>ext. football pitch. night</strong>: On a flood lit
five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on another team at
football.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.
Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking
fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning.
Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game
shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away
at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more
than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned
to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton lies on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I chose not to choose life: I chose
something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons
when you’ve got heroin?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Goldfinger’s better than Dr. No. Both of
them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in
its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course,
Thunderball was a notable success.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: People think it’s all about misery and
desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored,
but what they forget -</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I would say, in those days, he was a
muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like
Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a
formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: The only drawback, or at least the principal
drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you
that -</p>
<p><strong>int. pub i. night</strong>: Begbie, smoking and drinking,
speaks to camera.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: No way would I poison my body with that
shite, all they fucking chemicals, no fucking way.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub i. night</strong>: Tommy sits beside Lizzy. He
speaks to camera.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s a waste of your life, Rents, poisoning
your body with that shite.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton family home, living room. night</strong>:
Renton’s father and mother sit at the table eating.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Every chance you’ve ever had, you’ve blown
it, stuffing your veins with that filth.</p>
<p><strong>int. electrical retailers. day</strong>: Gav wears the
corporate jacket.</p>
<p><strong>gav</strong>: Get off that stuff, Rents and get a job. It’s
not as bad as it looks. While you’re here, you don’t fancy buying a
cooker, do you?</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Sick Boy and Spud lie
drugged up. Allison and Baby wait while Swanney cooks up.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: From time to time, even I have uttered the
magic words.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yeah. No more. I’m finished with that
shite.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Well, it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I’m going to get it right this time. Going
to get it set up and get off it for good.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Sure, sure. I’ve heard it before.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: The Sick Boy method.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: He’s always been lacking in moral fibre.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: He knows a lot about Sean Connery.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: That’s hardly a substitute.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: you’ll need one more hit.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: To see you through the night that lies
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: We called him the mother superior on account
of the length of his habit. He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew
it all. Of course I’d have another shot: after all, I had work to
do.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s flat room. day</strong>: The door opens and
Renton enters carrying shopping bags. He empties them on to a mattress
beside three buckets and a television.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation.
For this you will need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress;
tomato soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption
cold; ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of; Magnesia, Milk of, one
bottle; paracetamol; mouth wash; vitamins; mineral water; Lucozade;
pornography; one bucket for urine, one for feces, and one for vomitus;
one television; and one bottle of Valium, which I have already procured,
from my mother, who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way,
also a drug addict.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Swanney, Sick Boy, Spud
and Allison and Baby all lie inert while the telephone rings.</p>
<p><strong>int. call box. day</strong>: Renton curses as he slams down
the receiver. He dials again.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Mikey. It’s Mark Renton. Can you help me
out?</p>
<p><strong>int. mikey’s flat. day</strong>: Renton holds two opium
suppositories in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: This was typical of Mikey Forrester. What
the fuck are these? Under the normal run of things I would have had
nothing to do with the cunt, but this was not the normal run of
things.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Opium suppositories. Ideal for your purpose.
Slow release, like. Bring you down gradually. Custom fucking designed
for your needs.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I want a fucking hit.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: That’s all I’ve got: take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: For all the good they’ve done me I might as
well have stuck them up my arse.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Heroin makes you constipated. The heroin
from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt.
I am no longer constipated.</p>
<p><strong>int. betting shop. day</strong>: Renton walks through the
crowded, smoky betting shop towards a door marked ‘toilet’ with a bit of
card.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I fantasize about massive pristine
convenience.</p>
<p><strong>int. horrible toilet. day</strong>: This is the most horrible
toilet in Britain.</p>
<p><strong>int. horrible toilet cubicle. day</strong>: Renton locks the
door.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: A lorry on a building site dumps a load of
bricks, B52’s shed their load on Vietnam, the Blue Peter elephant,
etc.</p>
<p><strong>int. cubicle. day</strong>: Renton has his eyes closed. They
snap open.</p>
<p><strong>int. under water. day</strong>: Renton, dressed as before,
swims through murky depths until he reaches the bottom, where he picks
up the suppositories, which glow like luminous pearls, before heading up
towards the surface again.</p>
<p><strong>int. horrible toilet cubicle. day</strong>: The toilet is
empty.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s room. day</strong>: The mattress, buckets and
supplies are laid out as before.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Now. Now I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s room. day</strong>: The cans of soup, the
bottle of water, and the carton of ice cream are empty, the bottle of
pills spilt, the magazines well thumbed.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: You Only Live Twice?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Nineteen-sixty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Running time?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: One hundred and sixteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Director?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Lewis Gilbert.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Screenwriter?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Eh - Ian Fleming?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: OK, so who was it, then?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: You can look it up.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Who wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: But you’re looking better, it has to be
said. Healthier. Radiant even.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: You don’t know, do you?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: And I wondered if you’d care to go to the
park tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: The park?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Who wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Roald Dahl.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Roald Dahl. Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park. day</strong>: Typical weather, neither good nor
bad. The park is nondescript arid green with a few bushes. This is not
Kew Gardens. Renton and Sick Boy appear, dressed as before but for the
addition of cheap sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: The down side of coming off junk was that I
knew I would need to mix with my friends again in a state of full
consciousness. It was awful: they reminded me so much of myself I could
hardly bear to look at them. Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off
junk at the same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand,
but just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it, thereby
downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don’t you think? And when
all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry for myself, he insisted
on telling me once again about his unifying theory of life.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park. day</strong>: Seen through the telescopic sight of
an air rifle that wanders over various potential targets .</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: It’s certainly a phenomenon in all walks
of life.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Well, at one time, you’ve got it, and then
you lose it, and it’s gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for
example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Some of his solo stuff’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: No, it’s not bad, but it’s not great
either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it
sounds all right, it’s actually just shite.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: So who else?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm
McLaren, Elvis Presley. -</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: OK, OK, so what’s the point you’re trying to
make?</p>
<p><strong>ext. park. day</strong>: Sick Boy rests the gun down.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: All I’m trying to do is help you
understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise
uninterrupted downward trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What about The Untouchables?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I don’t rate that at all.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Despite the Academy award?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: That means fuck all. The sympathy
vote.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Right. So we all get old and then we can’t
hack it any more. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: That’s your theory?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Do you see the beast? Have you got it in
you sights?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should
present no significant problem.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: For a vegetarian, Rents, you’re a fucking
evil shot.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park. day</strong>: Renton loads up again.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Without heroin, I attempted to lead a useful
and fulfilling life as a good citizen.</p>
<p><strong>int. caf�. day</strong>: Two milkshakes clink together.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Good luck, Spud.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Now remember –</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: If they think you’re not trying, you’re in
trouble. First hint of that, they’ll be on to the DSS, ‘This cunt’s no
trying’ and your Giro is fucking finished, right?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: But try too hard –</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: And you might get the fucking job.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It’s a tightrope, Spud, a fucking
tightrope.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go
dumb and I can’t answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big
occasion, like a footballer.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Try this.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: A little dab of speed is just the ticket.</p>
<p><strong>int. interview office. day</strong>: A Woman and Two Men are
interviewing Renton. His job application form is on the desk in front of
them.</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the
Royal Edinburgh College.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: One of Edinburgh’s finest schools.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time
there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first
eleven, the soft know of willow on leather –</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: I’m an old boy myself, you know?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: Do you recall the school motto?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Of course, the motto, the motto –</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: Strive, hope, believe and conquer.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Exactly. Those very words have been my
guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.</p>
<p><strong>man 2</strong>: Mr. Renton –</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>man 2</strong>: You seem eminently suited to this post but I
wonder if you could explain the gaps in your employment record?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yes, I can. The truth – well, the truth is
that I’ve had a long-standing problem with heroin addiction. I’ve been
know to sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject
it into my veins. I’ve been trying to combat this addiction, but unless
you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven’t had a regular
job in years. I feel it’s important to mention this.</p>
<p><strong>int. office. day</strong>: The same office. The same team are
interviewing Spud.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was
worried that you wouldn’t have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh
College instead, because they’re both schools, right, and we’re all in
this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than
the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what’s the
point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many
O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that’s not
important. What’s important is that I am, right? That I am.</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your
application?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Only to get my foot in the door. Showing
initiative, right?</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: You were referred here by the Department of
Employment. There’s no need for you to get you “foot in the door”, as
you put it.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man.
You’re the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I’m merely
here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I’m not talking too
much. I don’t usually. I think it’s all important though, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>man 2</strong>: Mr. Murphy, what attracts you to the leisure
industry?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: In a word, pleasure. My pleasure in other
people’s leisure.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What do you see as your main strengths?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I love people. All people. Even people that no
one else loves, I think they’re OK, you know. Like Beggars.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Homeless people?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis
Begbie – one of my mates. I wouldn’t say my best mate, I mean, sometimes
the boy goes over the score, like one time when we – me and him – were
having a laugh and all of a sudden he’s fucking gubbed me in the face,
right –</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do
you see yourself as having any weaknesses?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I’m a
perfectionist. For me, it’s the best or nothing at all. If things go
badly, I can’t be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this
interview. Seems to me like it’s gone pretty well. We’ve touched on a
lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We’ll let you
know.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: The pleasure was mine. Best interview I’ve
ever been to. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Spud had done well. I was proud of him. He
fucked up good and proper.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub 1. day</strong>: Renton and Spud meet up after the
interviews.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: A little too well, if anything, a little too
well, that’s my only fear, compadre.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Another dab?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Would not say no, would not say no.</p>
<p><strong>int. office. day</strong>: The Woman and Two Men sit in
silence.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub 2. night</strong>: It is Saturday night in a busy,
city-centre pub on two levels. On a large upper balcony, overlooking the
bar and floor downstairs, sit Spud, Gail, Renton, Sick Boy, Tommy, Lizzy
and Begbie.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Picture the scene. Wednesday morning in the
Volley. Me and Tommy are playing pool. No problems, and I’m playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way. I’m giving the boy here the tanning of a
lifetime. So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot of
the tournament: I’m on the black and he’s sitting in the corner, looking
all biscuit-arsed. Then this hard cunt comes in. Obviously fancied
himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at me. Trying to put off,
like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if to say, ‘Come ahead, square
go.’ Well, you know me, I’m no looking for trouble but at the end of the
day I’m the cunt with the pool cue and I’m game for a swedge. So I
squared up, casual like. So what does the hard cunt do, or so-called
hard cunt? Shites it. Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the
fuck out of there. And after that, the game was mine.</p>
<p><strong>int. pool hall. day</strong>: The events in the pool hall, as
described by Begbie.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub 2. day</strong>: Begbie, his story complete,
finishes his pint. The others continue to stare at him, frozen as though
expecting something more. Begbie smiles and throws the pint over his
head.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: And that was it. That was Begbie’s story. Or
at least that was Begbie’s version of the story. But a couple of days
later I got the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he
never told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone.</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. day</strong>: Renton’s hand flicks through
a long row of videos on the floor while the sound of weights being
lifted emanates from nearby.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, sure it was Wednesday morning, we were
in the Volley playing pool, that much is true.</p>
<p><strong>int. pool hall. day</strong>: Tommy’s account over a
depiction of his version.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking
gash. He’s got a hangover so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue,
never mind pot the ball. I’m doing my best to lose, trying to humour
him, like, but it’s not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I
pot something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up. So
he’s got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so all he’s
go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a little pride and
maybe not kick my head in, right. So he’s on the black, pressure shot,
and it all goes wrong, big time. What does he do? Picks on this specky
wee gadge at the bar and accuses him of putting him off by looking at
him. Can you believe it? I mean, the poor cunt hasn’t even glanced in
our direction. He’s sitting there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him
with the cue. He was going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he
was going to do me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he’s a mate, you
know, so what can you do?</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. day</strong>: Tommy puts down his
weights.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Can I borrow this one?</p>
<p><strong>int. pub 2. night</strong>: The freeze-frame of the glass in
mid-air and Begbie’s smiling face.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yeah, the guy’s a psycho, but it’s true,
he’s a mate as well, so what can you do? Just stand back and watch and
try not to get involved. Begbie didn’t do drugs either, he just did
people. That what he got off on: his own sensory addiction.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: All right. Nobody move. The girl got glassed
and no cunt leaves here until we find out which cunt did it.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And who the fuck do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s flat. day</strong>: The empty cover for 100
Great Goals lies on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: And as I sat watching the intimate and
highly personal video, stolen only hours earlier from one of my best
friends, I realized that something important was missing from my
life.</p>
<p><strong>int. club. night</strong>: A mass of dancing bodies fills the
floor. The music is very loud.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How’s it going with Gail?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: No joy yet.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How long is it?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Six weeks!</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: It’s a nightmare. She told me she didn’t want
our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be
principally defined from then on in.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Where did she come up with that?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: She read it in Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Six weeks and no sex?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I’ve got balls like watermelons, I’m telling
you.</p>
<p><strong>int. nightclub, women’s toilet. night</strong>: Gail and
Lizzy are smoking and talking.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: I read it in Cosmopolitan.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: It’s an interesting theory.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Actually it’s a nightmare. I’ve been desperate
for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should
try it with Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get
from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: He forgot. Useless motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>int. nightclub. dance area. night</strong>: Tommy and Spud
seated as before. Their words are subtitled.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Useless motherfucker, that’s what she called
me. I told her, I’m sorry, but theses things happen. Let’s put it behind
us.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: That’s fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes, but then she finds out I’ve bought a
ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Went ballistic?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. ‘It’s me
or Iggy Pop, time to decide.’</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: So what’s it going to be?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, I’ve paid for the ticket.</p>
<p><strong>gail and lizzy</strong>: What are you two talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tommy and spuid</strong>: Football. What were you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: The situation was becoming serious. Young
Renton noticed the haste with which the successful, in the sexual sphere
as in all others, egregated themselves from the failures.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive,
but now it returned with a vengeance. And as the impotence of those days
faded into memory, grim desperation took hold in his sex-crazed mind.
His post-junk libido, fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine, taunted him
remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire dot.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. night</strong>: The Girl walks away from the
club, scanning the street for a taxi, and hail one which stops just as
Renton calls out.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Excuse me, I don’t mean to harass you, but I
was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt
with that situation. I thought to myself: she’s special.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Diane.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Where are you going, Diane?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: It’s where I live.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I’ll come back if you like, but I’m not
promising anything.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Do you find that this approach usually works,
or, let me guess, you’ve never tried it before. In fact, you don’t
normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you’re a quite,
sensitive type but if I’m prepared to take a chance I might just get to
know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a
little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don’t us girls just love
that?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Eh-</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, what’s wrong, boy? Cat got your
tongue.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I think I left something back at the -</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Are you getting in or not, pal?</p>
<p><strong>ext. road. night</strong>: The taxi motors along.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi. night</strong>: Renton and Diane are kissing
passionately in the back.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. night</strong>: Spud is pushed against the wall
held by his lapels. He drinks from a bottle of beer in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. night</strong>: Tommy and Lizzy kiss while
Tommy unlocks the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. diane’s home, hallway. night</strong>: In a darkened
suburban hallway, the door opens and two figures enter.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Diane.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Ssshh!</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. night</strong>: Tommy and Lizzy kiss
against the inside of th door, taking their outer clothes off.</p>
<p><strong>int. diane’s bedroom. night</strong>: By a pale bedside
light, Diane and Renton undress.</p>
<p><strong>int. gail’s bedroom. night</strong>: Spud is lying
unconscious on the bed. Gail stands over him.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Wake up, Spud, wake up. Sex.</p>
<p><strong>int. diane’s bedroom. night</strong>: Renton lies on his back
while Diane rides above him.</p>
<p><strong>int. gail’s bedroom. night</strong>: Gail throws Spud’s
clothes to the floor and throws a blanket over him.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. night</strong>: Tommy and Lizzy now lie on
the bed in a state of semi-undress.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Tommy, let’s put the tape on.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we’re
screwing.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fuck, OK.</p>
<p><strong>int. diane’s bedroom. night</strong>: Renton and Diane climax
together.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Christ, I haven’t felt that good since
Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Right. You can’t sleep here.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the
living room, or go home. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: And don’t make any noise.</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. night</strong>: The lights are full on
now. Lizzy sits on the bed clutching a blanket around herself.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: What do you mean, it’s ‘gone’? Where has it
gone, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’ll be here somewhere. I might have
returned it by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy?
To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off
to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.</p>
<p><strong>int. diane’s home, living-room. morning</strong>: Renton lies
submerged under a blanket.</p>
<p><strong>int. gail’s bedroom. morning</strong>: Spud opens his eyes.
With his fingers, he feels crusted liquid around his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>int. diane’s home, living-room. day</strong>: Renton pulls
himself up off the sofa and dresses as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>int. gail’s bedroom. day</strong>: Spud wipes the vomit from
his chest with a pillowcase, which he dumps in the middle of the sheets
before gathering the whole lot up as a bundle.</p>
<p><strong>int. diane’s home, hall/kitchen. day</strong>: The door
swings open. A Man and a Woman, about Renton’s age, sit at the kitchen
table. They look up to see Renton in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Good Morning.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Come in and sit down. You must be Mark.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yes, that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re a friend of Diane’s?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: More of a friend of a friend, really.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Are you her flatmates?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Flatmates. I must remember that one.</p>
<p><strong>int. gail’s home, hall/kitchen. day</strong>: The door swings
open to reveal the kitchen. Gail, her Father, and Mother are seated
around the table, eating breakfast. They look towards Spud, who carries
the knotted bundle of sheets as he approaches the table.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: Good morning, Spud.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Morning, Gail. Morning, Mrs. Houston,
Mr. Houston.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Sorry about last night -</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: It’s all right. I slept fine on the sofa.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I had a little too much to drink. I’m afraid I
had a slight accident.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh, don’t worry, these things happen. It
does everyone good to cut loose once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>gail</strong>: This one could do with being tied up once in a
while.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ll put the sheets in the washing machine
just now.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: No, I’ll wash them. I’ll take them home and
bring them back.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: There’s no need.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: It’s no problem.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No problem for me either.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Honestly, it’s no problem.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I’d really rather take care of it myself.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Spud, they’re my sheets.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I guess this means I’ll never get to have sex
with Gail.</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. day</strong>: Tommy sits alone,
watching</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Renton paces briskly down the
street, followed by Diane.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I don’t see why not.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Because it’s illegal.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Holding hands?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No, not holding hands.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: In that case you can do it. You were quite
happy to do a lot more last night.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: And that’s what’s illegal. Do you know what
they do to people like me inside? They’d cut my balls off and flush them
down the fucking toilet.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Calm down. You’re not going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Easy for you to say.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Can I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: If you don’t see me again I’ll tell the
police.</p>
<p><strong>ext. video store. day</strong>: In the cold light of morning,
Tommy and Lizzy wait, not speaking, outside the still-closed video
store.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rail bridge. day</strong>: A train speeds across.</p>
<p><strong>int. train. day</strong>: Sick Boy, Tommy, Spud and Renton
sit drinking from an extensive carry-out.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: This had better be good.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It will be. It’ll make a change for three
miserable junkies who don’t know what they want to do with themselves
since they stopped doing smack.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: If I’m giving up a whole day and the price
of a ticket, I’m just saying it had better be good. There’s plenty of
other things I could be doing.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Such as sitting in a darkened room,
watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer
your question?</p>
<p><strong>ext. station. day</strong>: The station is in the middle of a
moor. There appears to be no habitation around. In the distance are some
hills.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We go for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: A walk.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: But where?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I don’t know, Tommy. I don’t know if it’s…
normal.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s the great outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: It’s really nice, Tommy. Can we go home
now?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Look, Tommy, we know you’re getting a hard
time off Lizzy, but there’s no need to take it out on us.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Doesn’t it make you proud to be Scottish?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I hate being Scottish. We’re the lowest of
the fucking low, the scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile,
miserable, pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some
people hate the English, but I don’t. They’re just wankers. We, on the
other hand, are colonized by wankers. We can’t even pick a decent
culture to be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It’s a
shite state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make
any fucking difference.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton hands over money to
Swanney. Renton then begins cooking up. Also present and cooking or
shooting up are Spud, Swanney, Allison and Baby, and Sick Boy.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It looks easy, this, but it’s not. It looks
like a doss, like a soft option, but living like this, it’s a full-time
business.</p>
<p><strong>int. shop. day</strong>: Renton, Spud, and Sick Boy are
stuffing objects into their shirts and pockets.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton lies back,
narcotized.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Renton and Spud are running along
the street. Two uniformed Store Detectives are running after them. Sick
Boy stands in a doorway. As the Detectives run past, he strolls away in
the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton lies back as
before.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Ursula Andress was the quintessential Bond
girl. That’s what everyone says. The embodiment of his superiority to
us: beautiful, exotic, highly sexual and yet unavailable to everyone but
him. Shite. Let’s face it: if she’d shag one punter from Edinburgh,
she’d shag the fucking lot of us.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. later</strong>: Spud cooks up, watched
by Swanney. Nearby lie the drugged forms of Renton, Sick Boy and Allison
and Baby.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton family home, living-room. night</strong>:
Renton’s Mother and Father sit reading the paper and a magazine.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton family home, parents’ bedroom. night</strong>:
Renton trawls through drawers and any containers until he finds some
cash/jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton lies back, staring
vacantly ahead. Tommy flops down beside him. Renton shows barely a
flicker of awareness.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Lizzy’s gone, Mark, she’s gone and fucking
dumped me. It was the video tape and that Iggy Pop business and all
sorts of other stuff. She told me where to go and no mistake. I said, is
there any chance of getting back together, like, but no way, no fucking
way.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital ward sitting-room. day</strong>: A few elderly
patients sit in armchairs watching daytime television. Renton and Spud
jump and climb through an open window. Watched by the helpless patients,
they calmly disconnect the television and take it with them as they
leave by the same route.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton and Tommy slumped
side by side as before.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I want to try it, Mark. You’re always going
on about how it’s the ultimate hit and that. Better than sex. Come on,
I’m a fucking adult. I want to find out for myself.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Renton and Spud run along the
street.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Tommy lies drugged on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>int. flat to be burgled. day</strong>: The door of an
ordinary flat is kicked open. Begbie walks in, crowbar in hand, followed
by Sick Boy and Spud.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Honor Blackman a.k.a. Pussy Galore, what a
total fucking misnomer. I wouldn’t touch her with yours. I’d sooner shag
Col Kreb. At least you know where you are with a woman like that. Not
much to look at, like, but personality, that’s what counts, that’s what
keeps a relationship going through the years. Like heroin. I mean,
heroin’s got fucking great personality.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Swanney hands over a small
bag of heroin in exchange for ten pounds from Renton.</p>
<p><strong>int. flat to be burgled, kitchen. day</strong>: Spud checks
the fridge and pulls out a large chunk of deep-frozen meat. He hits with
the crowbar until it fractures and splits. Inside there is some
jewellery.</p>
<p><strong>int. car. day</strong>: The car is empty. A window is broken
and the door opened. The car alarm goes off. Renton reaches under the
seat and finds the radio/cassette. He then pulls the bonnet release.</p>
<p><strong>ext. car. day</strong>: The car alarm rings on until Renton
calmly produces a pair of wire cutters and a spanner to cut free and
release the battery. The alarm is silenced. Renton walks away with the
battery and the stereo.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Swanney taught us to adore and respect the
National Health Service, for it was the source of much of our gear. We
stole drugs, we stole prescriptions, or bought them, sold them, swapped
them, forged them, photocopied them or traded them with cancer victims,
alcoholics, old age pensioners, AIDS patients, epileptics and bored
housewives. We took morphine, diamorphine, cyclozine, codeine,
temazepam, nitrezepam, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal dextropropoxyphene,
methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine, buprenorphine,
dextromoramide chlormethiazole. The streets are awash with drugs that
you can have for unhappiness and pain, and we took them all. Fuck it, we
would have injected Vitamin C if only they’d made it illegal.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton lies back with his
eyes close. A football enters the frame to bounce off his head and out
again. He opens his eyes and it happens again. Opposite him, Spud, Sick
Boy and Tommy stand looking down on him. Tommy throws the ball
again.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub i. day</strong>: It’s the first day of the Edinburgh
Festival. Renton, Tommy, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie sit drinking. They
observe a young male American Tourist walk in in a bulky red anorak and
glasses. He goes past them towards the toilet. Begbie stands up.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub i, toilet. day</strong>: The American Tourist turns
from the urinal to see Begbie, Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and Tommy
approaching. Begbie punches and kicks the Tourist and pulls out a
knife.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi. day</strong>: The door of the taxi opens, Begbie,
Tommy, Spud, Sick Boy and Renton get in, carrying the red anorak and
glasses. As the taxi pulls away they study the photograph in the
passport. They look at one another in agreement.</p>
<p><strong>ext. taxi. day</strong>: The taxi motors along.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub i. night</strong>: A man at the bar is now wearing
the red anorak. Begbie divides up the money among Sick Boy, Tommy, Spud,
and Renton. Renton takes his share.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: And remember, Rents: no skag.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Aye, OK, Fr.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: But the good times couldn’t last for
ever.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Renton lies as before.
Around the room are Swanney, Allison, Tommy, Spud and Sick Boy. Allison
begins screaming and wailing. Slowly, the others rouse themselves to
varying degrees.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I think Allison had been screaming all day,
but it hadn’t really registered before. She might have been screaming
for a week for all I knew. It’s been days since I’ve heard anyone speak,
though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely
to fuck someone must have.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: What’s wrong, Allison?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Calm down, calm down. It’s going to be all
right, everything’s going to be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Nothing could have been further from the
truth. In point of fact, nothing at all was going to be just fine. On
the contrary, everything was going to be bad. Bad? I mean worse than it
already was.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to
Allison.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It wasn’t my baby. She wasn’t my baby. Baby
Dawn. She wasn’t mine. Spud’s? Swanney’s? Sick Boy’s? I don’t know.
Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to
say, something sympathetic, something human.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Say something, Mark, say something –</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I’m cooking’ up. There is a silence. Renton
begins scrambling around through the works.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Cook one for me, Renton. I need a hit.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: And so she did, I could understand that. To
take the pain away. So I cooked up and she got a hit, but only after me.
That went without saying.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Renton, Spud and Sick Boy cross
the road to approach the shop.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Well, at least we knew who the father was
now. It wasn’t just the baby that died that day. Something inside Sick
Boy was lost and never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which
to explain a moment like this.</p>
<p><strong>int. shop. day</strong>: Renton, Spud and Sick Boy are
stuffing their pockets, as seen before. Renton’s theft is interrupted by
Diane’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hello there, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Hey, go easy, lady. The boy’s got a habit to
support.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Opium doesn’t just grow on trees, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Renton and Spud are running,
pursued by the Two Store Detectives.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Nor did I. Our only response was to keep on
going and fuck everything. Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a
spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a
stinking purulent vein and do it all over again. Keep on going: getting
up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people over, propelling
ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong. As seen in
the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that screeches to a
halt as he crosses a road. He looks at the driver, at Spud running away
and the Store Detectives approaching. Because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal, you never have enough. No matter how often
you go out and rob and fuck people over you always need to get up and do
it all again. Renton smiles and waits. Sooner or later, this sort of
thing was bound to happen. One of the Detectives runs straight past him,
after Spud. The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch
in the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>int. court. day</strong>: Spud and Renton stand in the dock.
Renton’s Mother and Father, Sick Boy, Begbie, and Spud’s Mother are
among those in the gallery. The Sheriff delivers his sentence.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: …because shoplifting is theft, which is a
crime, and, despite what you may believe, there is no such entity as
victimless crime. Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does
not excuse them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret
or remorse. In sentencing you to six months’ imprisonment my only worry
is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton, I
understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an
attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The suspension of your
sentence is conditional upon your continued cooperation with this
programme. Should you stand guilty before me again, I shall not hesitate
to impose a custodial sentence.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Thank you, your honour. With God’s help,
I’ll conquer this affliction.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub i. day</strong>: The pub is crowded. Around Renton
are his mother, Father, Begbie, Sick Boy and Gav.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: It was fucking obvious that that cunt was
going to fuck some cunt.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I hope you’ve learned your lesson, son.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, my son, I thought I was going to lose
you there. You’re nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Clean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite
out for ever.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You listen to Francis, Mark, he’s talking
sense.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Fucking right I am. See, inside, you
wouldn’t last two fucking days.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: There’s better things that the needle,
Rents. Choose life.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I remember when you were a baby, even when
you would never do what you were told.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: But he pulled it off, clever bastard, and he
got a result.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Mrs Murphy, I’m sorry about Spud. It’s
wasn’t fair, him going down and not me –</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: It’s no our fault. Your boy went down
because he was fucking smack-head and if that’s not your fault, I don’t
know what is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. yard. day</strong>: Renton emerges into a narrow yard
surrounded by a high wall. He looks around. The steel back gate is
locked.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I wished I had gone down instead of Spud.
Here I was surrounded by my family and my so-called mates and I’ve never
felt so alone, never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they’ve had
me on this programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet
doses of methadone a day instead of smack. But it’s never enough, and at
the moment it’s nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning and
now I’ve got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a sweat on my
back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother superior for one
hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long, hard day.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. night</strong>: Swanney is cooking up.
Renton lands on the floor behind him like a gymnast.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What’s on the menu this evening?</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Your favourite dish.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Your usual table, sir?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Why, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: And would sir care to settle his bill in
advance?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Stick it on my tab.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Regret to inform, sir, that your credit
limit was reached and breached a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: In that case –</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Oh, hard currency, why, sir, that’ll do
nicely.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No, thank you. I’ll proceed directly to the
intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Perhaps sir would like me to call for a
taxi?</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s stairwell. night</strong>: The siren is a
little louder. Swanney holds Renton under his arms and drags him
backwards down the steps.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. night</strong>: As Swanney emerges, still
dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then an ambulance speeds by
without stopping. Swanney drags Renton across the pavement and into the
open door of a waiting taxi. Swanney then steps out of the taxi’s other
door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton’s pocket before
closing the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi. night</strong>: Renton lies on the floor of the
taxi, as Swanney left him, rolling slightly as the taxi takes a
corner.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hospital/taxi. night</strong>: The taxi is stationary.
We do not see the driver’s face but his hand opens the door and then
drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before taking the ten
pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away. Renton lies on the
pavement. Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a trolley. We do
not see the Porters’s faces as they wheel Renton into the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital accident and emergency department.
night</strong>: Renton is wheeled through the department, then into a
bay surrounded by a white nylon curtain.</p>
<p><strong>int. trolley bay. night</strong>: The Porters lift Renton
from one trolley on to another, then leave him alone in the bay
surrounded by the curtain. Renton lies alone. His breathing is still
shallow and erratic. Around him is the usual accident and emergency
paraphernalia: blood pressure machine, oxygen tap, bandages, etc. A
Doctor comes in and gives Renton an injection, then leaves.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Wake up. Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital corridor. night</strong>: The Porters wheel
Renton along.</p>
<p><strong>int. ward. night</strong>: The Porters lift Renton off the
trolley and dump him on the bed. A nurse sticks a thermometer in his
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>int. ward. day</strong>: Renton’s Father and Mother lift
Renton, now fully conscious, off the bed and dump him in a
wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital corridor. day</strong>: Mother walks ahead.
Behind her, Father pushes Renton in the wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>int. taxi. day</strong>: Mother and Father sit on either side
of Renton.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s bedroom. day</strong>: Father shoves Renton on
to the bed, then walks out past Mother, who looks at Renton for a moment
before closing the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. other side of renton’s bedroom door. day</strong>:
Renton’s Father’s hand slides three bolts across to lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s bedroom. day</strong>: Renton lies on the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I don’t feel the sickness yet, but it’s in
the post, that’s for sure. I’m in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill
to sleep, too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way.
Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have
ever known will soon take hold of me. It’s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We’ll help you, son. You’ll stay with us
until you get better. We’ll beat this together.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Maybe I could go back to the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No. No clinics, no methadone. That made you
worse, you said so yourself. You lied to us, son, your own mother and
father.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: At least get us some Tempazepam.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, you’re worse coming off that than you
are with heroin. Nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It’s a clean break this time.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re staying where we can keep an eye on
you.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I do appreciate what you’re trying to do, I
really do, but I need just one score, to ease myself off it. Just one.
Just one.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Well, this is a good laugh, you fucking
useless bastard. Go on, sweat that shite out of your system, because if
I come back and it’s still there, I’ll fucking kick it out.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: ‘Oh, you’ve got green eyes, oh, you’ve got
red eyes, and I’ve never met anyone quite like you before.’</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: It’s a mug’s game, Mrs Renton. I’m not
saying I was blameless myself, far from it, but there comes a time when
you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Better than sex, Rents, better than sex. The
ultimate hit. I’m a fucking adult. I’ll find out for myself. Well, I’ve
found out all right.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Mark, there’s something you need to do.</p>
<p><strong>int. consulting room. day</strong>: A Doctor stands up as
Renton enters.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Come in. Sit down, please.</p>
<p><strong>int. renton family home, living-room. day</strong>: Renton,
his mother and Father sit watching television.</p>
<p><strong>int. studio. day</strong>: Renton is sitting inside a plastic
booth shaped like a giant syringe. The Doctor, now dressed as a
game-show host, stands in front, with Renton’s Mother and Father beside
him.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Question number one: the human
immunodeficiency virus is a - what?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Retrovirus?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Retrovirus is the correct answer.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: CD4 receptor is the correct answer.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He’s our son.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Is the correct answer.</p>
<p><strong>int. consulting room. day</strong>: The Doctor watches in
silence as the Hostess, now dressed as a medical technician, draws blood
from Renton’s arm and puts it into a tube. She marks the tube with a
pre-printed, numbered label.</p>
<p><strong>int. studio. day</strong>: Mother opens one of the envelopes.
She is speechless with joy. The plastic booth opens up. Lights flash
again, etc. Renton steps out.</p>
<p><strong>int. social club. night</strong>: Renton, his Mother and
Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is a Saturday night
and the club is busy. Everyone sits in rapt silence. It is not initially
clear what is going on. Near the bar a Caller with a microphone calls
over the PA - Two and four, twenty-four…seven…fifteen…clickety-click,
sixty-six - And so on, as he draws the numbers from the drum. Everyone
studies their cards, except Renton, who studies the people instead, his
drink untouched. The number-calling continues until suddenly interrupted
by Mother’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Mark…Mark, you’ve got a house. House! House!
For goodness’s sake, Mark. They bustle around him and pass his card to
the front.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It seems, however, that I really am the
luckiest guy in the world. Several years of addiction right in the
middle of an epidemic, surrounded by the living dead, but not me – I’m
negative. It’s official. And once the pain goes away, that’s when the
real battle starts. Depression. Boredom. You feel so fucking low, you’ll
want to fucking top yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ext. housing estate. day</strong>: On the door of a flat
‘plaguer’, ‘HIV’, and ‘junky AIDS scum’ are daubed on the walls. The
sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be heard.</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. night</strong>: It is poorly furnished.
Tommy is seated. Renton has the football, which he kicks against the
wall and catches, then drops and kicks again, and so on. The ball is
slightly flat.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Are you getting out much?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Following the game at all?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No. Me Neither.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You take the test?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Clear?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I’m sorry, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Have you got any gear on you?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No, I’m clean.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, sub us, then, mate. I’m expecting a
rent cheque.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thanks, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No problem. No problem – easy to say when
its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital. night</strong>: Renton walks along a corridor
and into a ward.</p>
<p><strong>int. ward. day</strong>: Sheets cover the lower half of
Swanney in bed. They are thrown back to reveal the stump of an
above-knee amputation.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Surprise! Pa-pah!</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: And see when I get out of here. I’ve got
plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand,
where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live
like a king if you’ve got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your
pocket. No fucking problem.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: The strategy is this: get clean, get
mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I’ll be watching the
rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Sounds great, Swanney.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: You’ll have to send us a postcard.</p>
<p><strong>swanney</strong>: Sure will, pal, sure will.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park. day</strong>: Renton and Sick Boy are seated in
their firing patch, sitting on plastic bags with beer, vodka, hash and
the cassette player. The airgun is present as before, but they are not
making any use of it.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Eughh. Sounds horrible.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It wasn’t that bad.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Did he – you know?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No, he didn’t make me touch it.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Oh no, don’t even mention it.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: He made me lick it.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: God, you’re sick.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth,
jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: When are you going to visit him?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Don’t know. Maybe Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: You’re a real mate. And what about Tommy?
Have you been to see him yet?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Fuck you. OK, so Tommy’s got the virus.
Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn’t you noticed? Swanney
fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: You’re all hear.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee
lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them
happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It’s easy money for
me. Not exactly a fortune, but I’m thinking, ‘I should be coining it
here.’ Less whores, more skag. Swanney’s right. Get clean, get into
dealing, that’s where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good
load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: And I’ll tell you why. Because I’m fed up
to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies
and the like. I’m getting on with life. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s bedsit. night</strong>: Renton sits alone on
the bed, making a joint and reading a book. There is a knock at the
door. Renton answers the door.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Are you clean?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Is that a promise, then?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Calm down, I’m just asking. Is that hash I
can smell?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I wouldn’t mind a bit, if it is.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Well, it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Smells like it.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: You’re too young.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Too young for what?</p>
<p><strong>int. renton’s bedsit. night</strong>: Renton and Diane are
lying in the bed. Diane, wearing one of Renton’s T-shirts, is rolling a
mega-joint, quite unaware of the scrutiny of Renton.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: You’re not getting any younger, Mark. The
world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can’t
stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It’s Iggy Pop.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Whatever. I mean, the guy’s dead anyway.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year.
Tommy went to see him.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: The point is, you’ve got to find something
new.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: She was right. I had to find something new.
There was only one thing for it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. london. day</strong>: As contemporary retake of all
those ‘Swinging London’ montages: Red Routemaster/Trafalgar Square/Big
Ben/Royalty/City gents in suits/Chelsea ladies/fashion
victims/Piccadilly Circus at night. Incut with close-ups of classic
street names on a street map</p>
<p><strong>int. estate agent’s office. day</strong>: The montage ends on
one street, then draws back to reveal the whole map of London pinned to
a wall. A Man holding a telephone walks in front of the mape and belches
loudly. Revealing more, he is in a scruffy, cramped office with half a
dozen occupied desks and twice as many telephones. Seated at the one
nearest to the belching Man is Renton. He is wearing a shirt and tie
now. He turns in response to the belch.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Can you take this call?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Hello, yes, certainly. It’s a beautifully
converted Victorian town house. Ideally located in a quiet road near to
local shops and transport.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the ai in north london. day</strong>: Renton stands
waiting beside this busy London road, outside some very unfortunate
housing, as the traffic streams past.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Two bedrooms and a kitchen/diner. Fully
fitted in excellent decorative order. Lots of storage space. All mod
cons. Three hundred and twenty pounds per week.</p>
<p><strong>int. london flat. day</strong>: Renton shows the Couple round
a typical London flat nightmare. A poor conversion, poor decor,
everything small and ill-fitting. The windows rattle as the traffic
roars by.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I settled in not too badly and I kept myself
to myself. Sometimes, of course, I thought about the guys, but mainly I
didn’t miss them at all. After all, this was boom town where any fool
could make cash from chaos and plenty did. I quite enjoyed the sound of
it all. Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting, subletting,
subdividing, cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking away. There was
no such thing as society and even if there was, I most certainly had
nothing to do with it. For the first time in my adult life I was almost
content.</p>
<p><strong>int. london bedsit. night</strong>: Renton finishes eating a
pot noodle. He puts it down and picks up a letter. He lies back and
reads. Intercut with:</p>
<p><strong>int. schoolroom. day</strong>: A class is in progress. A
teacher lectures to a mixed class, but Diane is not listening as she is
writing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. school. day</strong>: Diane is leaving the school when
Sick Boy catches up with her. They stop and then she walks away.</p>
<p><strong>ext. park. day</strong>: Diane walks along a concrete path.
As she does so she has to step over Spud, who lies asleep/unconscious
beside the remains of a carry out.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Dear Mark, I’m glad you’ve found a job and
somewhere to live. School is fine at the moment. I’m not pregnant but
thanks for asking. Your friend Sick Boy asked me last week if I would
like to work for him but I told him where to go. I met Spud, who sends
his regards, or at least I think that’s what he said. No one has seen
Tommy for ages. And finally, Fracis Begbie has been on television a lot
this week. –</p>
<p><strong>int. london bedsit. night</strong>: Renton turns the
page.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: as he is wanted by the police in connection
with an armed robbery in a jeweller’s in Corstorphine. Take care. Yours
with love, Diane.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway outside bedsit. night</strong>: Renton opens the
door to an unseen figure. It is Begbie.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedsit. night</strong>: Renton sits on the bed. Begbie
stands over him, pointing a gun at his head. He pulls the trigger. It
clicks harmlessly.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Armed robbery? With a replica? How can it be
armed robbery? It’s a fucking scandal.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It’s a scandal, Franco.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Too right it is. Now look, have you got
anything to eat, ’cos I’m fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedsit. day</strong>: Begbie is sitting on the bed in
his underwear, eating cereal while watching television. A small
carry-out is nearby. Renton finishes dressing for work. He pauses at the
open door, looking back towards his guest.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Begbie settled in in no time at all.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway outside bedsit. day</strong>: Renton closes his
door. He is about to walk away when he heard Begbie shouting.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Rents, Rents, come fucking back here.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: I’ve no fucking cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedsit. night</strong>: Renton and Begbie lie in the
single bed with their heads at opposite ends. Begbie snores. Renton is
wide awake, with a pair of smelly- socked feet only inches from his
nose.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yeah, the guy’s a psycho, but it’s true,
he’s a mate as well, so what can you do?</p>
<p><strong>int. london bedsit. day</strong>: Where the first empty
packet of cigarettes fell to the floor there is now a large heap of
empty packets: the product of weeks at sixty a day. Another one lands on
the pile. Begbie, still in his underwear, still can in hand, sits
watchig the racing as before. Behind his, cigarettes and alcohol are
stacked up like a miniature duty-free warehouse. Renton sits behind him,
reading a book.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Hey, I’m wanting a bet put on.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Can you not go yourself.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: I’m a fugitive from the law. I can’t be seen
on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty.
Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway outside bedsit. day</strong>: The door opens,
Renton walks out, the door closes and Renton walks away. A wild,
frightening scream erupts from beyond the door.</p>
<p><strong>int. london bedsit. day</strong>: Begbie, alone in the
bedsit, is screaming a cry of primal joy.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Bad Bot came in at 16 to 1. And with the
winnings, we went out to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>int. london party. night</strong>: To loud music and
strobing, fractured lights, surrounded by dry ice, Begbie dances near a
tall woman. Other people dance nearby. Begbie gives the thumbs up to
Renton, who sits on a stool at one side drinking from a bottle of beer.
Begbie and the Woman walk away. Renton looks around the club at the
various men and women.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Diane was right. The world is changing,
music is changin, drugs are changing, even men and women are changing.
One thousand years from now there’ll be no guys and no girls, just
wankers. Sounds great to me. It’s just a pity that no one told
Begbie.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. night</strong>: A car sits in a street near the
club, windows steamed up.</p>
<p><strong>int. car. night</strong>: Begbie and the Woman embrace
passionately. The Woman undoes Begbie’s trousers.</p>
<p><strong>int. party. night</strong>: Renton’s gaze continues to wander
around.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: You see, if you ask me, we’re heterosexual
by default, not be decision. It’s just a question of who you fancy.</p>
<p><strong>int. car. night</strong>: Begbie and the Woman continue their
embrace as she unbuttons his shirt.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It’s all about aesthetics and it’s fuck all
to do with morality.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. night</strong>: Begbie stumbles away from the
car, pulling up his trousers as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: But you try telling Begbie that.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedsit. night</strong>: Begbie sits on the bed. Renton
is sitting on the floor watching.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: I’m no a fucking buftie and that’s the end
of it.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Let’s face it, it could have been
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Now, listen to me, you little piece of junky
shit. A joke’s a fucking joke, but you mention that again and I’ll cut
you up. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>int. bedsit. night</strong>: Begbie lies sleeping on the bed.
There are now two sets of feet by his head, one on each side. At the
other end lie Renton and Sick Boy .</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Since I last saw him, Sick Boy had
reinvented himself as a pimp and a pusher and was here to mix business
and pleasure, setting up ‘contacts’, as he constantly informed me, for
the great skag deal that was one day going to make him rich.</p>
<p><strong>int. estate agent’s office. day</strong>: Renton sits at his
desk, haggard and tired. Other people bustle around him. Telephones
ring, etc… In the background the Man is trying to promote a flat down
the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Beautifully converted Victorian town house.
Ideally located in a quiet road near to local shops and transport. Two
bedrooms and a kitchen/diner. Fully fitted in excellent decorative
order. Lots of storage space. All mod cons. Three hundred and twenty
pounds a week.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedsit. night</strong>: Renton , Begbie and Sick Boy sit
in a line on the bed with fish suppers laid out on their laps, but
Renton’s is untouched.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Good chips.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I can’t believe you did that.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I got a good price for it. Rents, I need
the money.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It was my fucking television.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Well, Christ, if I’d known you were going
to get so humpty about it, I wouldn’t have bothered. Are you going to
eat that?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Well, this guy I’ve met runs a hotel.
Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting
British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Why would I want to sell my passport?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: It was just an idea.</p>
<p><strong>int. left luggage room. day</strong>: Renton drops his
passport into an envelope and throws the envelope into a locker. He
turns the key and pockets it. RENTON</p>
<p><strong>ext. busy london road. day</strong>: Traffic floods past as
before.</p>
<p><strong>int. london flat. day</strong>: Inside the flat that Renton
showed the couple around. Sick Boy and Begbie are standing in the
hallway. Renton is in the open doorway. He throws them the keys and
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>int. london bedsit. night</strong>: The cramped bedsit is a
mess, filled with litter and unwashed clothes. Renton lies on his bed,
content to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>int. london flat. night</strong>: The flat is in darkness.
The door opens a figure enters. It is the man from Renton’s office.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: But, of course, they weren’t paying any
rent, so when my boss found two desperate suckers who would, Sick Boy
and Begbie were bound to feel threatened.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: As you can see, it’s a beautiful conversion.
Two bedrooms, kitchen/diner. Fully fitted. Lots of storage. All mod
cons. Three hundred and twenty quid a week.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedsit. day</strong>: Renton looks around the stripped,
empty bedsit one last time before closing the door as he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: And that was that. But by then we had
another reason to go back. Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. railway. day</strong>: An InterCity train speeds by.</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. night</strong>: A kitten sits on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>gav</strong>: Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never
knew he’d gon full-blown.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What was it, pneumonia or cancer?</p>
<p><strong>gav</strong>: No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Eh? How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>int. crematorium chapel. day</strong>: A service is in
progress. Those present include Renton and Gav, who are engaged in
hushed conversation, Begbie, Spud, Sick Boy, and Lizzy.</p>
<p><strong>gav</strong>: He wanted to see Lizzy again.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.</p>
<p><strong>gav</strong>: Exactly. I’m not wanting a cat, she says. Get
to fuck, right. So there’s Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine
what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over
the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or
downers. He didn’t know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I didn’t either. What the fuck is it?</p>
<p><strong>int. tommy’s flat. day</strong>: The kitten as before. Slow
track back to reveal more.</p>
<p><strong>gav</strong>: He starts getting headaches, so he just uses
more smack, for the pain, like. There he has a stroke. A fucking stroke.
Just like that. God home from hospital and died about three weeks later.
Been dead for ages before the neighbours complained about the smell and
the police broke the door down. Tommy was lying face down in a pool of
vomit.</p>
<p><strong>int. crematorium chapel. day</strong>: The coffin travels
away. Gav and Renton watch it go.</p>
<p><strong>gav</strong>: The kitten was fine.</p>
<p><strong>int. pub i. night</strong>: Gav, Renton, Spud, Sick Boy,
Begbie and a few others are gathered in the pub, still dressed in their
funeral garb.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Every time I think of Tommy I think of
Australian, because every time I went round he was just lying there,
junked out of his mind, watching Aussie soaps. Until he sold the telly,
of course, then he was just lying there. Buy every time I think of him,
I still think of Australia.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. night</strong>: Spud, Begbie, and Renton
are seated. Sick Boy is handing around bottles of beer before he too
sits down. They are all wearing their funeral garb. Renton raises his
bottle.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: No. On you go.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: There’s a mate of swanney’s. Mikey
Forrester – you know the guy. He’s come into some gear. A lot of
gear.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: About four kilos. So he tells me. Got
drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian
sailors. They’re fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then,
like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he’s done and get
very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {———- He’s looking for Swanney
to punt it, but Swanney’s nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg.
———-}</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: So he met me and I offered to take it off
his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it
on myself to a guy I know in London.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: So we’ve just come from Tommy’s funeral and
you’re telling me about a skag deal?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What was your price?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Four Grand.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: But you don’t have the money?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: We’re two thousand short.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: That’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you’ve
been saving up down in London.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Sorry, boys, I don’t have two thousand
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Yes, you fucking do. I’ve seen your
statement.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Two thousand, one hundred and thirty-three
pounds.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Four kilos. That’s what – Ten years’ worth?
Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days?
You’ve been to jail, Spud, so what’s the deal – like it so much you want
to go back again?</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I want the money, Mark, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there’ll
be no one going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Renton is visible first,
apparently talking to himself, then Diane.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It’s so simple. We buy it at four grand, we
punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at
sixty. Everyone’s happy, everyone’s in profit. I put up two. I come away
with six.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Unless you get caught.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut,
we’ll not be getting caught.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: So why have you told me about it?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Well, you’re not going to tell anyone, are
you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go
somewhere together.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’ve got a boyfriend, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: What? Steady like?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: That’s right: ‘going steady’ for four weeks
now.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: And what age are you? Thirteen?
Fourteen?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Sixteen next month.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What do you think – I should be carrying a
torch for you?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: So, what’s he like?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, he’s young and he’s healthy.</p>
<p><strong>int. swanney’s flat. day</strong>: Heroin is in the process
of being prepared for injection: heated, drawn up, etc. An arm is
prepared for injection: sleeve rolled up, tourniquet bound, veins
tapped, etc. Mikey forrester, Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie look on.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I hadn’t told anyone everything that was
running through my mind about what might happen in London. There were a
lot of possibilities I didn’t want to talk to anyone about. Ideas best
kept to myself. What no one told me was that when we bought the skag,
some lucky punter would have to try it out. Begbie didn’t trust Spud and
Sick Boy was too careful these days, so I rolled up my sleeve and did
what had to be done.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It’s good, it’s fucking good. ———-</p>
<p><strong>ext. bus station. night</strong>: Renton walks past a Beggar
huddling against a wall. The Beggar’s sign reads: ‘FALKLANDS VETERAN. I
LOST MY LEG FOR MY COUNTRY. PLEASE HELP.’ The beggar is Swanney.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Yes, that hit was good. I promised myself
another one before I got to London – just for old time’s sake, just to
piss Begbie off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. road. night</strong>: The bus travels towards
London.</p>
<p><strong>int. bus. night</strong>: Sick Boy dabs at amphetamine. Spud
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>int. bus toilet. night</strong>: Renton cooks up in the bus
toilet.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: This was to be my final hit. But let’s be
clear about this: there’s final hits and final hits. What kind was this
to be? {———-Some final hits are actually terminal one way or another,
while others are merely transit points as you travel from station to
station on the junky journey through junky life. ———-}</p>
<p><strong>int. bus. night</strong>: Begbie sits grimly. The others are
relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in
a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most
useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his
mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or
another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of
that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie
was hard, but not so hard that he didn’t shite it off twenty years in
Saughton.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Did you bring the cards?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: The cards. The last thing I said to you was
mind the cards.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Well, I’ve not brought them.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: It’s fucking boring after a while without
the cards.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Well, I’ve not brought them.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: It’s fucking boring after a while without
the cards.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Bit fucking late, like.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Well, why didn’t you bring them?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Because I fucking told you to do that, you
doss cunt.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>ext. london. day</strong>: The bus travels through
London.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: The gang enter a cheap hotel.
Begbie’s bag contains the heroin.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel. day</strong>: They are met by Andreas, a man in
his late thirties of Mediterranean appearance. He shakes Sick Boy’s
hand.</p>
<p><strong>andreas</strong>: These are your friends?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: These are the guys I told you about.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Is he here?</p>
<p><strong>andreas</strong>: Yes, he’s here. I hope you didn’t get
followed or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: We didn’t get followed.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room. day</strong>: An exceptional Man is waiting.
Andreas leaves the room and closes the door. The Man opens both and
tastes the heroin. He produces a set of kitchen scales from his bag and
weighs the two bags.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Straight away he clocked us from what we
were: small-time wasters with an accidental big deal.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So what do you want for it?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Twenty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But it’s not worth more than fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Ninteen.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Nineteen I can’t offer you, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: This was a real drag to him. He didn’t need
to negotiate. I mean, what the fuck were we going to do if he didn’t buy
it? Sell it on the streets. Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>int. london pub. day</strong>: The pub is crowded with
afternoon drinkers. Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie sit drinking.
Begbie is still keeping a firm hand on the sports bag, which now holds
the money.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: So what are you planning with your share,
Spud?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Buy yourself that island in the sun?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: For four fucking grand? One plam tree, a
couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I don’t know, maybe I’ll buy something for my
ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take
her out like, and treat her – properly.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Shag her senseless.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: No, I don’t mean like that – I mean something
nice, like, that’s all –</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: You daft cunt. If you’re going to waste it
like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks
in.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I got a round already.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I got the last one.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: It’s your round Franco.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: OK. Same again?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I’m off for a pish. When I come back, that
money’s still here, OK?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: The moment you turn your back, we’re out
that door.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: I’ll be right after you.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: You’ll never catch us, you flabby bastard.
Right, see, when I come back –</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: We’ll be half-way down the road with the
money.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: I’d fucking kill you.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I guess you would, Franco.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: I don’t know. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Still here, I see.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Why not? I know I would. Where’s Franco?</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: For fuck’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sorry, mate, I’ll get you another.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: All down my fucking front, you fucking
idiot.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Look, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Sorry’s no going to dry me off, you
cunt.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Cool down, Franco. The guy’s sorry.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fuck you. If you can’t hold a pint, you
shouldn’t be in the pub, mate. Now fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: Good one, Franco.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: Shut you mouth or you’ll be next.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: You’ve stabbed me, man.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: You were in my way.</p>
<p><strong>sick boy</strong>: We’d better go, Franco.</p>
<p><strong>spud</strong>: I’ve got to get to the hospital, man.</p>
<p><strong>begbie</strong>: You’re not going to and fucking hospital.
You’re staying there. And you bring me a fucking cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room. day</strong>: Renton lies awake, sharing a
bed with Sick Boy, who is asleep. Spud and Begbie lie on the other, both
asleep. Begbie has an arm draped over the bag, holding it close. Renton
gets up and goes to the small bathroom. He puts the light on above the
mirror and looks at himself. He washes his face and drinks a glass of
water, then walks back to the bedroom. Renton pulls on his jacket and
shoes. He stands over Begbie, then reaches carefully down to life
Begbie’s arm up. As he does so he realizes that Spud is watching him.
They say nothing. Renton takes the bag. Begbie stirs but does not
wake.</p>
<p><strong>int. locker. day</strong>: Envelope being removed.</p>
<p><strong>int. left luggage. day</strong>: Renton takes the passport
from the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street. day</strong>: Renton walks away.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: Now, I’ve justified this to myself in all
sorts of ways: it wasn’t a big deal, just a minor betrayal, or we’d
outgrown each other, you know, that sort of thing, but let’s face it, I
ripped them off. My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn’t give a shit
about him, and Sick Boy, well, he’d have done the same to me if only
he’d thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for Spud – he
never hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel. day</strong>: Prostitutes, punters, Sick Boy and
Spud line the corridor as two Policement walk past towards:</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room. day</strong>: Begbie goes radge.</p>
<p><strong>renton</strong>: So why did I do it? I could offer a million
answers, all false. The truth is that I’m a bad person, but that’s going
to change, I’m going to change. This is the last of this sort of thing.
I’m cleaning up and I’m moving on, going straight and choosing life. I’m
looking forward to it already. I’m going to be just like you: the job,
the family, the fucking big television, the washing machine, the car,
the compact disc and electrical tin opener, good health, low
cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home, leisurewear,
luggage, three-piece suite, DIY, game shows, junk food, children, walks
in the park, nine to five, good at golf, washing the car, choice of
sweaters, family Christmas, indexed pension, tax exemption, clearing the
gutters, getting by, looking ahead, to the day you die.</p>
