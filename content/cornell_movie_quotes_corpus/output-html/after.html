<h1 id="after">after</h1>
<p><strong>blinding whiteness</strong>: We hear a MAN GASPING softly.
Rhythmically. A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing
whiteness. Gradually we realize we’re moving across the ALABASTER BODY
of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.</p>
<p><strong>on the woman’s face</strong>: Ethereal. Her eyes closed. Her
face lifeless. Then… …her eyes open. She looks straight at us with
unseeing pale blue eyes. This is ANNA . We pull back. PAUL makes love to
Anna. Their movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at her.
Realizes she’s not there. He suddenly stops. Rolls off her. Sits on the
edge of the bed.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p>****: You used to enjoy it. Now it’s…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …it’s like fucking a corpse.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shit. I’m sorry. That was–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna. I’m sorry. That was a stupid thing to
say. But you know sometimes… sometimes it’s like you’re not here
anymore. Like you’re somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is this about us?</p>
<p><strong>on anna</strong>: her head bowed as she lets the water wash
over her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s not about us.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Then what is it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just want us to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>a drop of blood</strong>: falls into the water. Then another
drop.</p>
<p><strong>on anna</strong>: her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips.
Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF WATER
carries into the next scene…</p>
<p><strong>a stream of crystal blue water</strong>: A MAN’S HANDS
penetrate the water. Thin and elegant. Perfectly manicured. Turning
slowly as he washes them meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded
white towel. Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: The Antique Carlisle. Solid cherry. Hand
rubbed satin finish. Tufted sovereign interior. Eternal-Rest adjustable
mattress with matching pillow.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Or perhaps the Aegean? Solid bronze exterior.
Hand brushed finish with Grecian bronze highlights.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ayres</strong>: The Antique Carlisle. Definitely the
Antique Carlisle.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Excellent choice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ayres</strong>: An antique coffin for an antique lady.
We suit each other.</p>
<p>****: You’ll look beautiful.</p>
<p>****: Now about the service. Would you like a private visitation?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mrs. Ayres?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ayres</strong>: I’m sorry. Yes. A private
visitation.</p>
<p>****: Mr. Deane? What happens when we die?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It’s different every time. Each person dies
in their own way.</p>
<p><strong>tall kid</strong>: Hey. Jack-off!</p>
<p><strong>tall kid</strong>: Didn’t you hear me Jack-off?</p>
<p><strong>acne kid</strong>: He must be deaf.</p>
<p><strong>tall kid</strong>: You deaf Jack-off?</p>
<p><strong>tall kid</strong>: Can’t fucking speak either.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing Miss Bryant.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nothing? The incubator didn’t just fall by
itself.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I tripped. It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Show’s over. Get to your classes.</p>
<p>****: Jack. Help me clear up.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think it’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. The poor thing’s just scared.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: OK. Who took the last pepperoni?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Great. Broccoli. Who the fuck ordered
broccoli?</p>
<p><strong>neal</strong>: Oh that’s just disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>preppy guy</strong>: What’s wrong with vegetarian pizza? It’s
healthy.</p>
<p><strong>neal</strong>: Pizza isn’t supposed to be healthy.</p>
<p><strong>neal</strong>: You ordering in another pizza?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts.</p>
<p>****: Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi baby. I’m really sorry about this morning.
I fucked up. I know.</p>
<p>****: We still on for tonight?</p>
<p>****: Anna?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Please Anna. It took me weeks to get the
table.</p>
<p>****: Maybe we can change it to Thursday–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. It has to be tonight.</p>
<p>****: Paul? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nothing. Don’t worry. I just need… I just want
us to have dinner tonight.</p>
<p>****: Great.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And Anna. Everything’s going to be fine.</p>
<p>****: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p>****: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is someone there?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Did I scare you Miss Bryant?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Shouldn’t you be home?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My mom’s picking me up.</p>
<p>****: It’s my birthday. We’re going to MacDonald’s. Then on Saturday
my mom’s taking me to Busch Gardens. We’re going to ride the
Alpengeist.</p>
<p>****: Continually voted one of the top ten roller coaster rides in
America, the Alpengeist is a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I didn’t know the park was open yet.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My mom’s friends with the manager. They’re
opening it specially for me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sounds like fun.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. It will be fun.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Jack. Those boys. Do they bother you a
lot?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know you can always talk to me about it if
you want to.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You sure you don’t need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well. I better run.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p>****: I have to go to a funeral. My old piano teacher.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can I come?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No Jack. Funerals are very private
affairs.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ve never been to a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It wouldn’t be appropriate Jack. Anyway
wouldn’t your mom worry about you?</p>
<p>****: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m sure she would. I’ll see you tomorrow in
class. Have a wonderful birthday.</p>
<p><strong>on sink</strong>: Startling white. A stream of water flows
into the sink. Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually
turns a deep crimson red.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Anna? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes Mother.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Terrible color.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Can I get you something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You have to eat.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The doctor said–</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: The doctor’s an idiot. He doesn’t know
what he’s talking about.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Why did you do it? Today of all days.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What have I done wrong this time?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You’ve forgotten haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No I haven’t forgotten. The service isn’t till
six.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Then you’ve got plenty of time to wash it
out.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s permanent. You can’t wash it out.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Then dye it back. You can’t show up at the
funeral looking like that. Like some prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t look–</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Don’t argue with me. Why are you
constantly arguing with me?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: To do the washing up.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: The sheets need changing. They haven’t
been changed in months.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I changed them Monday.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You weren’t here Monday. You never sleep
at home anymore. What if something happened to me in the middle of the
night?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nothing is going to happen to you.</p>
<p>****: Fat lot of good she is. I wouldn’t have to pay for a Nurse if
my only daughter wasn’t living in sin with that lawyer of hers. Doing
God knows what. They always leave you in the end. You’ll see. Just like
your father–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s enough Mother!</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: That’s it. Go and cry to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Go and bitch to Paul about your mean old
mother.</p>
<p><strong>father graham</strong>: We have entrusted our brother James
Hutton to God’s mercy in sure and…</p>
<p><strong>father graham</strong>: …certain hope of the resurrection to
eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died and rose again for
us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hutton</strong>: White roses. They were his favorite.
How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: They just seemed appropriate somehow.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hutton</strong>: He looks so peaceful. As if he’s only
sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Mrs. Hutton. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hutton</strong>: Thank you Anna. You were always his
favorite student.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hutton</strong>: How’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Fine. She sends her condolences.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hutton</strong>: You look tired dear.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. I’m fine. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s pov</strong>: James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the
velvet trimming. Suddenly his LIPS PART… as he GASPS SOFTLY.</p>
<p><strong>viewing room</strong>: Anna steps back terrified. Stares at
Hutton. His face serene again. It must have been her imagination. She
glances up quickly. Embarrassed. Eliot’s still observing her. He nods to
her cordially.</p>
<p><strong>eliot’s pov</strong>: Anna’s by her car rummaging in a bag
for her keys. Getting increasingly frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You scared the life out of me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Your hair.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I didn’t say that. It’s just very… red. I mean
it’s not really you is it?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Are you ready to order?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes. We’ll have the duck.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What? You always have the duck here.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t always have the duck.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ll have the duck.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The duck is very good.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s not argue tonight. OK?</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: Anna takes a sip of wine.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This is good.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And looks very expensive…</p>
<p>****: What’s the special occasion?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Actually there is something I need to talk to
you about.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve been offered a transfer to head office in
Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’ll mean more work of course. More
responsibility. A lot of changes. But it’s an incredible opportunity.
I’d be crazy to turn it down. And…</p>
<p>****: …well I’ve been thinking. Maybe it’s time for us to…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re going to leave me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You could’ve just told me this morning. You
didn’t need to buy me off with an expensive meal.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna wait.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why did you lie to me? You promised everything
was going to be OK.</p>
<p>****: Don’t be ridiculous. Anna. You’ve got it all wrong.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not being ridiculous. Why do you always
talk to me like I’m a small child?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: See? There you go again. Do you know how
irritating that is?</p>
<p>****: Jesus. Can’t we just have one fucking meal without arguing–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Keep your voice down, everyone’s watching.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re crazy. You know that? Just like your
mother.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m nothing like my mother!</p>
<p>****: I’m not running after you this time Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna. Open the door. Please. I want you to
come with me. I want to…</p>
<p><strong>on rearview mirror</strong>: Paul stands forlornly in the
rain. Their eyes meet.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s car</strong>: She hesitates. For a moment we think she
might go back to him…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: OK. OK. I saw you.</p>
<p>****: Jerk.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just
don’t want it to end like this.</p>
<p><strong>on metal pipes</strong>: The badly loaded pipes BANG
OMINOUSLY against each other.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re in a funeral home.</p>
<p>****: You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You had a car accident. It was raining. You
hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You were pronounced dead eight hours ago.
Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are
slowly dying. Your body’s already decomposing.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>on document</strong>: It’s Anna’s death certificate.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: This is your death certificate. Cause of
death. Massive internal trauma. Time of death. 8.23PM.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You were dead on arrival. The attending
physician signed here… …at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from
the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Don’t touch me! Why are you touching me?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m preparing your body. You have to look
beautiful for your funeral.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You all say the same thing.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. Maybe you should rest now.</p>
<p><strong>on anna</strong>: The lights go off. O.S. the door clicks
shut as it locks automatically behind Eliot.</p>
<p>****: I can’t be dead. It’s just a nightmare. I’ll wake up soon. Wake
up.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just
don’t want it to end like this.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: It’s the schoolteacher’s. From the car
crash. Should I answer it?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Someone’s in for a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: How many times do I have to tell you? You
can’t leave their stuff laying around. It should’ve been returned to the
family.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: I’ve been busy, OK.</p>
<p>****: Like she’s really going to need her rollover minutes now.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: What shall I do with this?</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: Where’s the other one?</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: Just burn it. You can’t send them back one
shoe. It’s not respectful.</p>
<p>****: You got it all wrong baby. I want you to come to Chicago with
me. Look. I’ll swing by your place on my way to the office. You know I
love you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p>****: It’s me again. I must have just missed you at home. Call me
when you get this. OK?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: … the shell grows slowly…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh hi. I’m looking for Anna Bryant.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry but you just can’t–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m Anna’s… fianc�e. Paul Conran. I thought
this was her class.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We had a little misunderstanding last
night.</p>
<p>****: She didn’t come in today.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did she call in sick?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: She hasn’t called in at all. It’s not like
her. She always calls in.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please don’t hurt me.</p>
<p>****: How can I hurt you? You’re already dead.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Then why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please. Just let me go. I won’t go to the
police. I won’t tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re still in denial. You have to trust me.
I’m only here to help you.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Don’t be scared.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor
mortis setting in so I can work on your body.</p>
<p>****: Your mother’s early.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It’s always so
tragic when you lose a child.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I lost her years ago.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: If you’d care to come to my office we can
discuss the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I want to see her.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: But she hasn’t been–</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I don’t care. I want to see her.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Ah. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: As I said. I’ve only just started preparing
her.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: What’s the point of preserving the body if
the soul’s already left?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. The soul never leaves.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: It’s us who are left behind. It’s us who
suffer.</p>
<p>****: Who’s going to look after me now? Did you think about that?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’ll confirm the date with Father Graham this
afternoon. Friday as you requested.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Just do what you think’s best. It’s just
details.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Oh there is one thing.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Her hair. She was a brunette. I’d like it
back to that color.</p>
<p><strong>paul’s pov</strong>: Beatrice’s car pulls up. Diane gets out.
Pulls the wheelchair out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>paul’s car</strong>: Paul grabs the flowers.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mrs. Bryant.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi Diane. I need to talk to Anna.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I think you better come in.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What happened? Where’s Anna?</p>
<p>****: Anna was in a car accident last night. My daughter’s dead.
That’s what happened.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A car crash? When?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: They said it happened just before 8.30.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: But… we were at the restaurant…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You shouldn’t have let her drive in that
weather.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. She can’t be dead. There must be some
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: There’s no mistake. We just got back from
the funeral home.</p>
<p>****: Flowers? How appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why didn’t you call me?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You took her away from me. I don’t want
you anywhere near her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I must be in shock. That’s all. It’s just
shock.</p>
<p>****: Let me out!</p>
<p><strong>eliot’s pov</strong>: Paul stands in the middle of the
driveway staring blankly at the Funeral Home.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Mr. Deane?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My name’s Conran. Paul Conran.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Of course. The lawyer. It’s a small town. In
my line of work you get to know everyone eventually.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m Anna Bryant’s fianc�e.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: That’s strange. She wasn’t wearing an
engagement ring.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well not quite fianc�e…</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’d like to see her.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m afraid the viewing isn’t until–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’d need to see her now. If that’s
possible.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s not possible. You’re not
family and–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Please. It’d only take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I understand. But–</p>
<p>****: Paul! I’m here! Paul!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I tried to stop her. She didn’t hear me.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mr. Conran. There really is nothing I can do.
I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No one.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No one?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It was Paul.</p>
<p>****: I know. I heard you talking to him. Why didn’t you let him see
me?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Did you love him?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You weren’t going to tell me Paul was here,
were you?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Because it would only hurt you. You have to
let go of the living. Just like they have to let go of you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t believe you. Why are you doing this to
me?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re all the same. You all blame me for
your death. As if it were my fault.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. You drugged me. So my mother</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: The others. They just see you as a dead body
on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m a busy man. I don’t have time for
this.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Oh I nearly forgot. How tall are you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Five seven.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why..?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I need to know how tall you are. For your
coffin.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh God. Please. I don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>on newspaper</strong>: Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car
Crash.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You were supposed to pick me up from school
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I waited.</p>
<p>****: Hang on a sec.</p>
<p>****: Mr. Conran. Heard about your girlfriend. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is Tom in?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: The captain just stepped out. He
won’t be long. You can wait in his office if you want.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thanks. I’ll just go and grab a coffee.</p>
<p>****: A buddy of the captain’s. Poor guy…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s car</strong>: Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the
KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places
his hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange noise. He
looks up… The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling face
now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until it abruptly stops.
Staring straight at us. Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a
PALE WOMAN’S HAND slowly reaches through the window… and touches Paul’s
shoulder. He jumps. Turns. ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at
him. The color drains from Paul’s face.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>garage</strong>: Paul gets out awkwardly. He can’t look Tom
in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p>****: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I just found out. I’m so sorry Paul. If you
need anything–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need to see Anna.</p>
<p>****: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The funeral director won’t let me see her Tom.
He says I’m not family. Can you talk to him? Put some pressure on
him.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tom. You’re my friend.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Paul. I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You sure you’re OK?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Paul. It was an accident. You should get some
rest. Let me drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I always fuck everything up.</p>
<p><strong>behind anna’s back</strong>: her hands clutch the large
scissors.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of
hair dye with photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he
looks across at Anna. She’s staring at something behind him. Eliot
turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old Woman on the gurney. He
quickly walks over. Carefully pulls the white sheet over the Old
Woman.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mrs. Whitehall.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You shouldn’t be afraid of her. The dead
can’t harm the dead.</p>
<p>****: But I’m not dead!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Give me the scissors. I only want to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Don’t come any closer. I swear to God I’ll
kill you.</p>
<p>****: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>close on eliot’s face</strong>: The sharp tip pushes into his
skin.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: For a moment we think she might do it.
But then she wavers.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m breathing! Look. I’m still alive!</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You think you’re still alive because you’re
still attached to life. It’s normal. You’re just imagining you still
have symptoms of life.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The doctors
made a mistake. They’re always making mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You died. Everyone dies.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How can I be dead if we’re talking?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: We’re talking not because you’re alive. But
because I have a gift.</p>
<p>****: I can talk to those between life and death.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: To help them make the transition.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is this what happens when you die?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It depends on how you lived your life.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as
soon as their body dies. Others don’t let go until long after they’re in
the grave.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Am I a ghost? Is that why I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re here so I can bury you.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Come. We’ve wasted enough time already.</p>
<p>****: No. Please. I don’t want–</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re a corpse. Your opinion doesn’t count
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But I can breathe. I must be alive.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You people. You all think that if you
breathe, shit, piss you’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You clutch onto life as if your life was
worth clutching onto. Was your life worth clutching onto Anna?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Was it? Maybe you died a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I have to tell you I’m surprised you’re still
arguing with me. You don’t have much time left. Look. She’s accepted her
death. Her life has been examined. She has no more regrets. And now
she’s at peace. She used her time well. You still have so much to
learn.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I have nothing to learn!</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Your funeral’s in three days. Soon you’ll be
enclosed in a coffin. Then buried in the ground. No-one will hear you
then. No-one will talk to you there.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Are you cold?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m so cold.</p>
<p><strong>on plastic ankle tag</strong>: Name: Carol Whitehall. Sex: F.
DOB: 11.02.30.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You had a long life.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You look so peaceful.</p>
<p>****: Aren’t you scared?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m scared. I’m so scared.</p>
<p><strong>on paul</strong>: The music’s strangely distorted now. Almost
silent. As if we were inside Paul’s head.</p>
<p><strong>from inside the darkness</strong>: the small shape of Anna in
the doorway. The huge dark space engulfs her. The only light comes from
the Prep Room behind her.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears
into the thick blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then… …a
CHILD’S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna’s wrist. Pulling her
in with surprising strength. Anna struggles to free herself. But the
hand drags her deeper into the darkness. The door slams shut behind
her.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: I’m disappointed with you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You promised me so many things.</p>
<p>****: You don’t recognize me?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I am you. I’ve been waiting for you. You
shouldn’t have disappointed me.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: You’re not ready.</p>
<p><strong>on casket</strong>: The Old Woman. Her long hair braided. She
looks serene.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Then perhaps you can help me. Could you throw
these away for me?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>on jack</strong>: as he looks at the wilted flowers. He
crushes a petal then sniffs his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: There’s no life left in them.</p>
<p><strong>viewing room</strong>: Jack looks up. Eliot’s watching him
carefully.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: They belong in the garbage.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’ve seen you round here before.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought it was Miss Bryant’s funeral.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Ah. Miss Bryant. No. Her funeral’s not until
Friday.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where is she now?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: She’s downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Why? Because she’s not ready.</p>
<p>****: Is the flower for her?</p>
<p>****: She was my teacher.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Well Jack. What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mrs. Whitehall’s funeral. Did you find it
interesting?</p>
<p>****: It was OK I guess.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Oh. I see.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are all funerals the same?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No Jack. They’re never the same. Each one is
special. The dead always speak to us in different ways.</p>
<p>****: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It was a pleasure talking to you Jack.</p>
<p>****: Why did you do this?</p>
<p><strong>why did you do this?</strong>: Anna stares at him
blankly.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is this the afterlife? Am I in heaven? Or am I
in hell?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The door…</p>
<p>****: There was a door. Just there.</p>
<p>****: It won’t be long now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I used to believe in God. I thought I’d see
him when I died. Instead I saw you.</p>
<p>****: Maybe you are God.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’ll be at peace soon. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul.</p>
<p>****: Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul’s pov</strong>: Anna stands in front of the shower with
her back to him. She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then
her hand moves to her chest. There’s a STRANGE WET SUCKING sound… …as
Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her
bathrobe.</p>
<p><strong>on the still beating heart</strong>: dripping crimson blood
onto the bone white tiles.</p>
<p>****: Anna.</p>
<p>****: Mom! We’re out of milk.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It’s your dress. For your funeral. Your
mother brought it round this morning.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This isn’t my dress. This is my mother’s
dress! It was supposed to be for her funeral. Why has she given it to
me?</p>
<p><strong>on eliot’s hand</strong>: An old-fashioned wooden rosary.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then
glances over at Anna. She’s still staring at the dress. He opens a
drawer beneath the counter. It’s full of rosaries and printed Holy
cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the drawer. Closes it. Then
turns back to Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It should have been her not me. She was the
one dying. Not me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not ready to die.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Why are you still struggling?</p>
<p>****: I’m not ready to die. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: There’s nothing out there for you
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>on eliot</strong>: as he gets up and turns to Anna.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: Anna looks at him calmly. We can’t tell
if she managed to get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and
wheels the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room. Nudges
the door stop away with his foot.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’ll be back soon.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Thirty-four fifty.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Sir. Your change.</p>
<p>****: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s pov</strong>: Eliot’s van pulls up in front of the
house.</p>
<p><strong>entrance hall</strong>: Anna’s trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of
Eliot’s footsteps on the gravel outside. Anna looks round
desperately.</p>
<p><strong>just around the corner</strong>: Anna pushes herself against
the wall clutching the knife.</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: Eliot turns towards her… then at the last
moment changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction towards the
viewing room.</p>
<p>****: Please pick up. Please pick up.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul. Please pick up.</p>
<p>****: Paul. I’m here.</p>
<p>****: Help me Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m the only one who can hear you now.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’d be very careful if I were you. The dead
have such a hold over the living.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: He still feels your presence. You’re only
causing him more pain. If you really loved him, you’d accept your death
and let him go.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Then prove to me I’m really dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You people. You always need proof.</p>
<p><strong>on mirror</strong>: A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes. A
blood-stained tear in the side of her RED SLIP.</p>
<p><strong>upstairs room</strong>: Anna’s stunned. She moves closer to
the mirror. Touches her reflection through a thin layer of dust.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why do I look like a corpse?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Because you are a corpse.</p>
<p><strong>on mirror</strong>: Anna stares blankly at her image in the
mirror.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It’s time you finally accepted the truth. You
are dead. You will never live again.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I am dead.</p>
<p><strong>upstairs room</strong>: Eliot smiles. Like a father proud of
his child’s first step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a
brief flicker of unease in Eliot’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eliot’s pov</strong>: Jack stands in the driveway holding his
bicycle. Looking up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.</p>
<p><strong>jack’s pov</strong>: Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She
looks frightening in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>driveway</strong>: Strangely Jack isn’t scared. He continues
staring up at the window. Calmly. Curiously.</p>
<p>****: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Bad dream?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I was dead. I had a car accident. Did you ever
dream you were dead?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ssh. Don’t talk so loud. You’ll wake the
neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What neighbors? You don’t have any
neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you ever love me Anna?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Say it. Say you love me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Aren’t you going to pick it up?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Me? No. It’s probably for Eliot.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is it always like this?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I thought when you died you wouldn’t feel
anything. You wouldn’t feel any more pain. You wouldn’t have to struggle
anymore.</p>
<p>****: But it just doesn’t stop does it?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. It’s no problem at all.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’ll pick up the deceased from the hospital.
Yes. This afternoon? That’ll be fine. It’s my pleasure Mr. Merano.</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: Well here he is. Frank Merano.</p>
<p><strong>on body</strong>: FRANK , the top half of his head has been
flattened. His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Ouch. That had to hurt.</p>
<p><strong>morgue</strong>: Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain.
Signs the release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy.</p>
<p>****: I’ll leave you to sort out her things.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr. Conran?</p>
<p>****: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My name’s Jack. Miss Bryant was my
teacher.</p>
<p>****: I saw her last night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was going past the funeral home. Miss Bryant
stood there. In the window. In a red dress.</p>
<p>****: Anna doesn’t have a red dress.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You think I’m lying. I’m not lying.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look… Jack. I’m in no mood–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She needs your help.</p>
<p>****: Jack. Anna’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t help her anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Maybe you just don’t love her anymore?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You little fuck. You think this is funny?</p>
<p><strong>stocky teacher</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Are you alright sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: The police are on their way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jack… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Step back sir.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They’re not pressing charges.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What the hell’s wrong with you? You’re this
close to fucking up your career.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know what he told me? He told me Anna’s
alive.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You didn’t believe him did you?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s just… I’m having these…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nothing. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s pov</strong>: Frank stares back at her with open dull
eyes. His face partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to
give Frank’s face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of wire
with a fishhook-like barb at each end.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: His mouth. To keep it closed.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Now his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is this how you’ll prepare my body?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. There’s no need. I had to rebuild his
face. You’re still beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Does he have family?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes. A brother. He’s coming in later.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: My mother… She didn’t cry did she? When she
came to see me?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And Paul?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It’s not important anymore.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I need to know.</p>
<p>****: No. He didn’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I knew he wouldn’t. He always got upset when I
cried. He said crying never helped.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You should rest.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re getting weaker. It’s almost time.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why do we die?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: To make life important.</p>
<p><strong>on polaroid</strong>: The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in
her casket.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found what
you were looking for.</p>
<p><strong>room</strong>: Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply. As if someone
had spoken to him.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman. No need to
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I really enjoyed our time together.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Anthony. Anthony. Always confused.</p>
<p><strong>eliot’s pov</strong>: A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front
door. A SQUAD CAR parked on the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>eliot’s room</strong>: Eliot steps back. Calmly continues to
dry his hands.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: How can I help you Officer?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I’d like to see the body.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Frank Merano. I’m his brother. Vincent
Merano? I called this morning.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mr. Merano. Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I hope it’s no trouble. I’d just like to
see him before the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It’s no trouble at all.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Your brother’s here.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He looks so peaceful. You’ve done a
beautiful job. Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You should remember him as he used to be.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s the schoolteacher isn’t it?</p>
<p>****: Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything else I can help you
with?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Something’s not right here.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Not right?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: His smile. It was a bit more…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …smiley.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Smiley.</p>
<p><strong>on frank’s mouth</strong>: Eliot manipulates Frank’s
lips.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A touch more.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s much better. Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m glad I could help.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes
alone with him?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. Not at all. I’ll wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t see…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well. I guess I should be off then. I’ll
see you at the service. Thanks again.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I just told you. That was your brother. You
had an accident. You’re dead. Why do you people never listen to me?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. It’s not a gift. It’s a curse.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I take care of each of you as if you were my
children. I wash the shit from your bodies. I dress you. I do everything
to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. And what do
you do?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You argue with me. As if it were my fault
you’re dead. As if I was to blame. What? You’re not talking to me now?
You don’t want to?</p>
<p><strong>on frank’s face</strong>: The crudely drawn bright red lips.
Clown-like circles of rouge. Gaudy and macabre.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You don’t talk because you have nothing to
say. And you have nothing to say because you’re a corpse.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: From Eliot’s reaction it seems as if
Frank has started to talk again.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. Now I don’t want to talk to you
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m off to school now.</p>
<p><strong>jack’s pov</strong>: Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet
interior. His face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.</p>
<p><strong>viewing room</strong>: Jack stares in fascination at Frank’s
body. He reaches into the casket. Touches Frank’s cold hand. In the b.g.
Eliot walks into the viewing room. He stops surprised. Watches Jack
intently.</p>
<p>****: What’s it like? Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>viewing room</strong>: Jack turns quickly. Eliot stands over
him.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You have empathy with the dead. You’re drawn
to them. Just as they’re drawn to you. It’s a rare gift.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I know you saw Anna.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re frightened by it. I was scared too the
first time. But you shouldn’t be. Christ had the same gift. He raised
Lazarus and spoke to the dead.</p>
<p>****: You spoke to Miss Bryant?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ve spoken to others?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes. Many others.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who was the first one you spoke to?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: My mother.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You shouldn’t be afraid.</p>
<p>****: The others. They won’t understand. They don’t see what we
see.</p>
<p>****: I can help you. I can teach you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Your fingernails are dirty.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Your hands are normally so clean.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’ve been gardening.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is it sunny outside?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes. The tulips love the sun.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I miss the sun.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Are they your favorite flower?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Tulips? Yes. I think so.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I thought it’d be lilies. White lilies. Don’t
they symbolize death?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. They symbolize purity.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And tulips?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Unrequited love.</p>
<p>****: What’s your favorite flower?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Violets.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: A beautiful flower. They need shade and lots
of water.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What do they symbolize?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Faithfulness.</p>
<p>****: Do they?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Roses are red, violets are blue…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. Leave it on. It’s so peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>on store window</strong>: A RED-SLIP on a mannequin. Just
like ANNA’S RED SLIP.</p>
<p><strong>street</strong>: The light’s turned green. The DRIVERS HONK
angrily. Paul doesn’t hear them. He places his hand against the plate
glass. Stunned.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Deane.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mr. Conran. A pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I love gardening, but I’m not sure gardening
loves me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s not dead is she?</p>
<p>****: Mr. Conran.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Someone saw her.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: One of Anna’s students. In the window.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Do you mean Jack?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Of course I know him. He’s often round here.
He seems to have a strange fascination with death. He’s eleven years old
Mr. Conran. And like all young boys has a vivid imagination. Now if
you’ll excuse me–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t think he imagined it. I think he
really saw her.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Maybe you just want to believe he saw
her.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mr. Conran!</p>
<p>****: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mr. Conran. I think you should leave before I
call the police.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s down there?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s in here isn’t she? Give me the key.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Give me the fucking key.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m here Anna.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. Please Anna.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We’ll be happy again. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t live without you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mr. Conran. She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I know what you’re going through. Denial’s a
natural part of grieving…</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: …but you’ve got to accept she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She needs my help.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You can’t help her anymore. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need you to issue a search warrant.</p>
<p>****: I need a fucking search warrant. Now are you going to help me
or what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Paul. Sit down.</p>
<p>****: Sit. Down.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just what the hell do you think you’re doing? I
got a call from Eliot Deane. Are you out of your fucking mind?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna’s not dead Tom. He won’t let me see her.
He’s keeping her there–</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Anna was in a car accident. Her car was wrecked
Paul. Remember? It’s downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Here’s the Coroner’s report.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look. The paramedics phoned it in. They only
checked for eye dilation and pulse. The doctor signed the death
certificate without even seeing her body.</p>
<p>****: So? That’s standard procedure.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There was no EEG. Nothing. He could have
drugged her to make it look like she was dead.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Drugged her? Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: There are drugs like that chief. Hydronium
Bromide. Total paralysis within seconds. The heartbeat slows to almost
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: See? I’m telling you. She’s not dead. The boy
at school. Jack. He saw her.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I saw her.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: She was on the slab. Dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ve seen dead bodies. Believe me, she was
definitely dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Tom. Just go down there and check the place
out.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: On what grounds Paul? Do you have any
evidence?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No. But–</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Do you have anything?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think she called me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Called you?</p>
<p>****: On the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Collect or long distance?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: First you hit a fucking kid. Then you attack
Deane. And now you’re telling me your dead girlfriend called you? What
the fuck’s going on? You’re loosing it Paul.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I know you feel guilty but you’ve got to pull
yourself together.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Maybe you’re right. But why won’t he let me
see her?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look Paul. The funeral’s tomorrow. You’ll see
her then. It’ll help. It will give you closure. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You said you could teach me.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It’s only a hole in the ground. I’m digging
it for–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Miss Bryant.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Exactly. For Anna. She belongs here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: No. Because there’s no life left in her.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Don’t you see? I have no choice. I’m the only
one who can see all these corpses. Wandering the earth aimlessly. All
they do is piss and shit. Suffocating us with their stench. Doing
nothing with their lives. Taking the air away from those who actually
want to live. I have to bury them all. I have no choice.</p>
<p>****: Now there’s two of us.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You did well this morning.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This morning?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: When Paul came. You did the right thing. You
let him go.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’ll be all right now? Won’t he?</p>
<p>****: Why do I have to get dressed?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Tomorrow’s your funeral.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Already?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I told you. You only had three days.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I told you to use your time well.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I need to… I have so many regrets. I have
nothing but regrets.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s why I’m here isn’t it? To be
judged.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re here to understand your life. So you
can finally be at peace.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I wanted a different life.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Then why didn’t you do anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No matter what I did everything just stayed
the same. I’d wake up. I’d shower. Sit in the same traffic everyday on
my way to work. Go home. Go to sleep. Then wake again.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: What did you really want from life?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I just wanted to be happy.</p>
<p>****: Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy. What does it mean
Anna? To be happy?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know. Don’t you understand? That’s the
whole point. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Yes you do! You’re just too scared to admit
it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it anymore. I just
want this to be over.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: What did you want from life?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t fucking know!</p>
<p><strong>i wanted love! ok!</strong>: Anna’s stunned. She’s finally
admitted it.</p>
<p>****: I wanted love.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You had love. Paul loved you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. You don’t understand. I was scared. I
wanted to love but I didn’t know how. I was…</p>
<p>****: When I was a child… my mother.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When I was a child. I learnt that love. That
when you love someone. You get hurt. So I learned not to love. That way
no one could ever hurt me again.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I was always pushing Paul away. He thought I
didn’t love him.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He was the only one I ever loved. But I never
told him that. And then he stopped loving me.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: What would you do if you had another
chance?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Well? Isn’t this what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>old women</strong>: Spit it out.</p>
<p><strong>old women</strong>: Spit it out.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I thought you were different. You all say
you’re scared of death. But the truth is you’re more scared of life.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m glad I’m dead. I’m glad it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>from the bushes</strong>: Someone watches Paul tentatively
move to another window.</p>
<p><strong>funeral home</strong>: Paul strains to open the window when
suddenly… he’s caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly. A
DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m taking you home.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t be scared. It’s better this way.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t even know your name.</p>
<p><strong>on anna</strong>: Her eyes still closed.</p>
<p><strong>on eliot</strong>: Eliot pauses. Too confused to look back at
her.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: It’s…</p>
<p>****: It’s not important.</p>
<p>****: It’s time now.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You have to look beautiful for your
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>on ampoule</strong>: We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM
BROMIDE.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: This will relax your muscles. Make your skin
radiant. As if you were still alive. Just sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: This is how they’ll all remember you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Can I see myself for the last time?</p>
<p><strong>on mirror</strong>: Anna looks peaceful. Beautiful.
Serene.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is this the end?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: The last part is the most difficult. You’ll
have to face it alone. But you’ll be at peace soon.</p>
<p><strong>prep room</strong>: Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged
mirror, then at Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Anna. We’ve been through this before. You’re
just imagining–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re still clutching onto life. Don’t give
in to your fears. You’re so close.</p>
<p>****: Why did you lie to me?</p>
<p><strong>on anna</strong>: …delicately closes Anna’s eyelids.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Good bye Anna.</p>
<p><strong>father graham</strong>: I am the resurrection and the life.
Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live.</p>
<p><strong>father graham</strong>: They that sleep in the earth will
awake and shout for joy; and the earth will bring those long dead to
birth again.</p>
<p><strong>on casket</strong>: Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes
closed. She can hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.</p>
<p><strong>father graham</strong>: We have come here today to remember
before God our sister Anna. To give thanks for her life.</p>
<p><strong>on anna’s face</strong>: We see an almost imperceptible
frown.</p>
<p><strong>viewing room</strong>: Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane
wheels her to the casket. Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then
touches the violets in Anna’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Violets. They were her favorite flowers. How
did you know?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Violets just seemed appropriate somehow.</p>
<p><strong>paul’s pov</strong>: Anna looks serene.</p>
<p><strong>viewing room</strong>: Paul takes out the ring box from his
pocket. Gently slides the engagement ring onto Anna’s stiff finger.
Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.</p>
<p>****: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s so cold.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m sorry Anna.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s at peace now.</p>
<p><strong>on coffin</strong>: A drop of blood falls onto the polished
wood.</p>
<p><strong>viewing room</strong>: Eliot stares at the blood for a
moment. Takes out a pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the
blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.</p>
<p>****: Don’t be scared. It’s better this way.</p>
<p><strong>father graham</strong>: We have but a short time to live.
Like a flower we blossom and then wither. In the midst of life we are in
death.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You sure you’re going to be OK?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah. Thanks Tom.</p>
<p><strong>on polaroids</strong>: We pan slowly across the other
photographs we saw before. But now we look at them differently. In some
faces there is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading look.
In others passive resignation.</p>
<p><strong>eliot’s room</strong>: Eliot moves towards the window.</p>
<p><strong>eliot’s pov</strong>: The dark cemetery. In the distance
flickering candles illuminate Anna’s grave.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Imagine Anna. The whole world, your mother,
your fianc�e, your friends. Everyone has buried you. They’ve placed a
stone above your body.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: They’ve said their good byes and gone back to
their TV dinners and shopping malls. Thinking that this is never going
to happen to them. Until it’s their turn to be buried. Think about it
Anna…</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: …think about it while you still can.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You said she was alive.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I never said she was alive. I just said I saw
her.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: OK. See you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr. Conran?</p>
<p>****: Don’t forget to fasten your seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>jack’s pov</strong>: Eliot stands in the window smiling at
him.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Don’t you think you’ve had enough to
drink?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p>****: Mr. Conran. We’re at a wake. You should show more respect.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know she wasn’t dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Wasn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral Home,
making wild accusations. You have no idea what happens when someone
dies. What happens to their body. What happens to their soul.</p>
<p>****: You think Anna was alive after the accident? Maybe you’re
right.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Maybe she’s still alive. You obviously don’t
believe a word I say. So why don’t you go and find out for yourself
Mr. Conran. Find out whether she’s alive or dead.</p>
<p>****: You twisted fuck.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You don’t have much time left.</p>
<p><strong>father graham</strong>: Please. Paul. You’re not well.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>the screen flashes to white.</strong>: Paul opens his eyes.
The ROAD’S EMPTY. No sign of any traffic. He’s confused. The road was
busy a moment ago. Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate
the car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.</p>
<p><strong>on rearview mirror</strong>: An AMBULANCE moves quickly
towards him. Blasts past.</p>
<p><strong>car</strong>: Paul looks through the front windshield.
Nothing. He frowns. Where did the ambulance go?</p>
<p><strong>up ahead</strong>: We see the Funeral Home. Bone white in the
moonlight. The cemetery next to it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna. I’m here. Please God. Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Baby. Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You came back for me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I came back for you. You’re safe now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p>****: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Are we going home?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Or do you want to make love here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where did you go?</p>
<p>****: I’ve been waiting for you. I missed you so much.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I love you. I always did.</p>
<p>****: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s only the scissors…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Scissors? What scissors?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Scissors. For your clothes. Eliot just put
them on the table.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re safe now. We’re finally together.</p>
<p><strong>fade to searing whiteness.</strong>: Paul blinks as he
gradually gets used to the harsh light. Slowly the room comes into
focus…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You’re in a funeral home.</p>
<p>****: You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You had a car accident. You swerved off the
road. On the way to the cemetery. Hit a tree.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I saw Anna. You buried her alive.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: I’m sorry Mr. Conran. You never made it to
the cemetery. You never saw Anna. You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: Your skull was crushed. Your spinal cord
pulverized. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body’s already
decomposing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>eliot</strong>: You people. You all say the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not dead.</p>
</body>
