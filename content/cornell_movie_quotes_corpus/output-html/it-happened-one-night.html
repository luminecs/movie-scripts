<p><strong>it happened one night</strong>: Written by Robert previous
hit Riskin</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Fine! Fine! She ought to like this.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Who’s gonna take it in to her? You?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Oh, no. Mullison! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>mullison</strong>: Not me, sir. She threw a ketchup bottle at
me this morning.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Well, orders are orders! Somebody’s gotta
take it in. Fredericks!</p>
<p><strong>fredericks</strong>: Before I bring her another meal, I’ll be
put off the ship first.</p>
<p><strong>steward’s voice</strong>: Henri!</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: No, Monsieur. When I leave the Ritz you do
not say I have to wait on crazy womans.</p>
<p><strong>another waiter</strong>: My wife was an angel compared to
this one, sir. And I walked out on her .</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Come on! Make up your mind!</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: What’s up? What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: These pigs! They’re afraid to take her food
in.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: That’s ridiculous! Afraid of a mere girl! Why
didn’t you do it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: I never heard of such a thing! Afraid of a
mere girl. I’ll take it in myself.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Can’t get a thing done unless you do it
yourself. Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: Afraid of a mere girl! Ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: On a hunger strike, huh? When’d she eat
last?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: She hasn’t had a thing yesterday�or
today.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Been sending her meals in regularly?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yessir. She refuses them all.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Why didn’t you jam it down her throat?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: It’s not quite that simple. I’ve dealt with
prisoners in my time, but this one�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Absurd! All this fuss over a snip of a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: This is dangerous business, Mr. Andrews.
After all, kidnapping is no child’s play.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What’s this! What’s happened here?</p>
<p><strong>lacey</strong>: She refused another meal, sir.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Get another tray ready. Bring it here at
once. Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What’s this about not eating?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t want to eat! And there’s one more
thing I don’t want! Definitely! That’s to see you.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Know what my next move is? No more
cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why don’t you put me in chains?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I might.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you
want! But I’m not going to eat a thing until you let me off this
boat!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know
I’m going to have my way.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I won’t stand for it! I won’t stand for your
running my life! Why do you insist on it!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You ought to know why. Because�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. I know. Because I’m your daughter and
you love me. Because you don’t want me to make any mistakes.
Because�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Because marrying that fool King Westley
is�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re wasting your time. I’m already married
to him.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Not so far as I’m concerned, you’re
not.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Wait a minute! Don’t get excited! This
isn’t for you. Put it right here.</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: Anything else, Monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: No. Everything seems quite satisfactory. I
may want some more of that delicious gravy. I’ll ring.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Very good, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Heavenly!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Smart, aren’t you! So subtle.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would
change the whole political situation in India.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You can’t tempt me. Do you hear? I won’t
eat!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Please. I can’t fight on an empty stomach.
Remember what Napoleon said.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I hope you’re not comparing yourself to
Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead
pipe.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Most humiliating thing ever happened to me. A
bunch of gorillas shoving me in a car! That crowd outside the justice of
the peace�must have thought I was a criminal�or something.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: South America.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: South America!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: We leave Miami in an hour. Soon’s we get
some supplies aboard.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’ll have a corpse on your hands! That what
You’ll have. I won’t eat a thing while I’m on this boat.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: In that event, we won’t need so many
supplies.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What do you expect to accomplish by all this?
I’m already married!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’ll get it annulled.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’ll never do it! You can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’ll do it if it takes every penny I’ve
got. I’ll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the
Peace! I’ll do it�if I have to prove that you were dragged in,
staggering drunk. You probably were. Mmm�mmm. This filet mignon is
divine!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’ve you got against King Westley?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Nothing much. I just think he’s a fake,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You only met him once .</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: That was enough. Do you mind handing me the
ketchup?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You talk as if he were a gigolo�or
something.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Never mind�I’ll get it myself. Gigolo? Why,
you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He’s one of the best fliers in the country.
Right now he’s planning a trip to Japan.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’re going to finance him, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why not? Look what he’s doing for aviation.
It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he’s
accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you’d like to have me marry
a business man. Well, I hate business men�particularly if you’re a
shining example.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Your whole life is devoted to just one thing.
To accumulate more money. At least there’s romance in what he’s
doing.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: He’s no good, Ellie, and you know it. You
married him only because I told you not to.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’ve been telling me what not to do since I
was old enough to remember.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Aw, listen, Dad. Let’s not fight like this
any more. I know you’re worried about me�and want me to be happy. And I
love you for it. But please try to understand. You’re not being fair,
darling. This isn’t just a crazy impulse of mine. King and I talked
about it a lot before we decided to get married. Look�why can’t we give
it a trial�let’s say�for a year or so. If it’s wrong, King and I will be
the first to know it. We can get a divorce, can’t we? Now, be a dear,
and let me off the boat. Keeping me prisoner like this is so silly.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’ll be set free when the marriage is
annulled.</p>
<p><strong>andrews’ voice</strong>: So there’s no use being a stubborn
idiot.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I come from a long line of stubborn
idiots!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: A time will come when you’ll thank me for
this.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I won’t thank you! I’ll never thank you!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Please don’t shout.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’ll shout to my heart’s content! I’ll scream
if I want to.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey,
too. Just the way I like it.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Ellie! Next on the DECK, at the open cabin
door, Andrews is seen, staring off at something and an amazed,
frightened look comes into his eyes. Then, as viewed from his position
at the cabin door, Ellie appears standing on the rail; and with a
professional dive, she leaps into the water.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: It’s my daughter! Go after her.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Lower the boats!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Sorry, sir. She got away.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Of course she got away�too smart for
you.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What a hell cat. No controlling these
modern girls. They’re terrible!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She’s
great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she
wants. She’s not going to get it though. She won’t get very far. Has no
money.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What about that diamond wrist watch she had
on�she can raise some money on that?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: We’re wastin’ our time. Can you
picture Ellie Andrews ridin’ on a bus?</p>
<p><strong>second detective</strong>: I told the old man it was the
bunk.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Here’s your ticket, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Oh, thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: When does the bus leave?</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: In about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: Hey, what’s going on here? I’d like to use
that phone.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Shh! Quiet. This is history in the
making.</p>
<p><strong>shorty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: There’s a man biting a dog in there.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Atta-boy, Petey, old boy! Atta-boy!�</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: I’m not going to stand for this any
longer. In a pig’s eye, you will!�</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Is that so? That’s telling him, Petey old
boy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, monkey-face�when you fired me, you
fired the best newshound your filthy scandal sheet ever had.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Say, listen, you wouldn’t know a story if it
reached up and kicked you in the pants. Yeah? Sure, sure, I got your
copy. Why didn’t you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I’d
start a new department.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That was free verse, you gashouse
palooka!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s okay by me! ’Cause as far as I’m
concerned, I’m through with newspapers! See? I’m through with stupidity!
I’ll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I
have to starve. Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with
that�</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: When you get through with that, I’ll have a
beard down to my ankles.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Gordon�</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Did you know he reversed the charges on
that call?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What! Say, listen you! When you get back to
New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office�unless you
don’t care what happens to that funny map of yours. In the PHONE BOOTH
Peter reacts to the phone being hung up on him. But he goes right on for
the benefit of the boys.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, so you’re changing your tune, eh? Well,
it’s about time. But it’s going to do you no good, my tough friend. It’s
a little too late for apologies. I wouldn’t go back to work for you if
you begged me on your hands and knees! I hope this is a lesson to
you!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Atta-boy, Peter. That’s telling him, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Give me any of his lip, will he? Huh! I guess
he knows now what I think of his job! Is my chariot ready?</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: Your chariot awaiteth withouteth, oh
mighty King.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Make way for the King. Long live the King. Make
way.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s right, my friends. Cling to your jobs!
Remain slaves the rest of your lives! Scum of the earth! Newspaper men!
Not me! When I’m basking in the glorious arms of the Muse�what’ll you be
doing? Chasing news. You miserable worms. For what? A mere pittance! My
heart goes out to you.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Goodbye, Oh mighty King! Peace be with you,
Courageous One!</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: All aboard. Philadelphia, New
York. All aboard.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Look out. Get back. Farewell. Farewell.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Scram.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, driver! How about clearing this stuff
away!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Whadda you want!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you’ll be good enough to remove those
newspapers I’ll have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young
feller.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Personally, I was raised on a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What do you think you’re doing!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean
throwin’ ’em out!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh�the papers�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s a long story, my friend. You see, I
don’t like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came
off on my white pants.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Hey, whadda you tryin’ to do�kid me?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t kid you . On the level, it
actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all
over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What’re you gonna do about the papers?
Somebody’s gotta pick ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s okay with me. I’m not arguing.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock
on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look here, partner. You may not like my nose.
But I do. It’s a good nose. The only one I’ve got. I always keep it out
in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it,
make sure you don’t miss.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Now, that’s a brilliant answer. Why didn’t I
think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You win!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Excuse me, lady�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I beg your pardon!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Now, listen. I’m in a very ugly mood. I put
up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it’s just the same to you�
scram.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Driver!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Are those seats reserved?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: No. First come, first served.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Driver!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: These seats accommodate two passengers, don’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Maybe they do�and maybe they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Move over, lady. This is a “maybe they
do.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Next time you drop in, bring your folks.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tell that man not to drive so fast.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He got away. I suddenly found myself in the
middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t know what you’re raving about, young
man. And, furthermore, I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well�of all the�well� Maybe you’ll be
interested to know your bag’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, my heavens! It’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I knew you’d catch on eventually.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front
of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What am I going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t tell me your ticket was in it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No, I’ve got that, all right. But my money.
All I have here is four dollars. I’ve got to get to New York with
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You can wire home for some money when we get
to Jacksonville.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, no�I� Yes . . . I guess I will.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll report it to the driver. About your bag,
I mean.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No. I’d rather you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t be a fool. You lost your bag. The
company’ll make good. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t want it reported!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why, that’s ridiculous! They’re responsible
for everything that�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: See here, can you understand English! I don’t
want it reported! Please stay out of my affairs! I want to be left
alone. A close-up of PETER shows him glaring after her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why, you ungrateful brat!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry� Silly, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Everybody’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That was foolish of me. Why didn’t you shove
me away?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I hated to wake you up.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No, thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How much time have I?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: About a half hour.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m going over to the Windsor Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>driver’s voice</strong>: The Windsor! You’ll never make it in
time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: You’ll have to wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>driver’s voice</strong>: Wait for you!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. I may be a few minutes late.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Where’s the bus to New York?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Left twenty minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, that’s ridiculous! I was on that bus�I
told them to wait!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry, Miss. It’s gone. Ellie’s face clouds.
The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her
eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the view then moves
over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Remember me? I’m the fellow you slept on last
night.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Seems to me I’ve already thanked you for
that. What time is the next bus to New York?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Eight o’clock tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Eight o’clock! Why, that’s twelve hours!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the matter? Wouldn’t the old meanies
wait for you? reply�this angers him, and he continues Say, how old are
you anyway? Don’t you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a
guardian.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What are you excited about? You missed the
bus, too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I missed it, too.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Don’t tell me you did it on my account!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re doing a pretty sloppy job of it.
Here’s your ticket.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: My ticket?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I found it on the seat.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ll never get away with it, Miss
Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and
Westley’ll make an ideal team.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Will you please tell me what you’re raving
about!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
Your father’ll stop you before you get half way to New York.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You must have me confused with�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Quit kidding! It’s all over the front pages,
You know, I’ve always been curious about the kind of a girl that would
marry King Westley.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Take my advice�grab the first bus back to
Miami. That guy’s a phony.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I didn’t ask for your advice.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s right. You didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re not going to notify my father, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If you play your cards right, you might get
some money out of it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I never thought of that.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Listen, if you’ll promise not to do it, I’ll
pay you. I’ll pay you as much as he will. You won’t gain anything by
giving me away as long as I’m willing to make it worth your while. I’ve
got to get to New York without being stopped. It’s terribly important to
me. I’d pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht
was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I’ll
give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get
to New York.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Never mind. You know I had you pegged right
from the start, you’re the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way
you can get anything is to buy it. Now you’re in a jam and all you can
think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word
“Humility”? No, you wouldn’t. I guess it never occurred to you to just
say, “Please mister, I’m in trouble. Will you help me?” No; that’d bring
you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something;
maybe it’d take a load off your mind. You don’t have to worry about me.
I’m not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley,
your father, you’re all a lot of hooey to me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You send telegrams here?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go on. Go on send the telegram.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: “How would you like to have the story, you
big tub of�of�”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mush. Mush.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: “Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I
said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you
burning? Peter Warne.” Well, that will be $2.60.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Send it collect.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Collect?</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: Bus for
blah-blah-blah-blah�Charleston�blah-blah-blah�and all points North to
New York!</p>
<p><strong>drummer</strong>: Hi, sister�All alone? My name’s
Shapeley.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley’s voice</strong>: Ask any of the boys. They’ll tell
you. Shapeley sure knows how to pick ’em. Yessir. Shapeley’s the name,
and that’s the way I like ’em.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: You made no mistake sitting next to me.
Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain’t
nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who
you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can’t be too particular,
neither. Once when I was comin’ through North Carolina, I got to gabbin’
with a good-lookin’ mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty
classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you
could’a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when
she’s yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well
give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin’ about. Yessir,
you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. What’s the matter, sister?
You ain’t sayin’ much.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Seems to me you’re doing excellently without
any assistance.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: That’s pretty good . . . Well, shut my big
nasty mouth!</p>
<p><strong>shapeley’s voice</strong>: . . . Looks like you’re one up on
me. Nothin’ I like better than to meet a high-class mama that can snap
’em back at you. ’Cause the colder they are, the hotter they get, is
what I always say.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Take this last town I was in. I run into a
dame�not a bad looker, either�but boy, was she an iceberg! Every time I
opened my kisser she pulls a ten strike on me. It sure looked like cold
turkey for old man Shapeley. I sell office supplies, see? And this
hotsy-totsy lays the damper on me quick. She don’t need a thing�and if
she did she wouldn’t buy it from a fresh mugg like me. Well, says I to
myself�Shapeley, you better go to work. You’re up against a lulu. Well,
I’m here to tell you, sister, I opened up a line of fast chatter that
had that dame spinnin’ like a Russian dancer. Before I got through she
bought enough stuff to last the firm a year. And did she put on an act
when I blew town!</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Yessir. When a cold mama gets hot�boy, how
she sizzles! She kinda cramped my style, though. I didn’t look at a dame
for three towns. Not that I couldn’t. For me it’s always a cinch. I got
a much better chance than the local talent. You see, they’re kinda leery
about the local talent. Too close to home. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley’s voice</strong>: But take a bird like me�it’s here
today�and gone tomorrow. And what happens is nobody’s business.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: But I don’t go in for that kinda
stuff�much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You’re my
type. No kiddin’ sister. I could go for you in a big way.
“Fun-on-the-side Shapeley” they call me, and the accent is on the fun,
believe you me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Believe you me, you bore me to
distraction.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Well, you’re two up on me now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s a seat over there for you.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: What’s the idea?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’d like to sit with my�uh�wife�if you don’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Wife?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Come on�come on!</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin’�you
know�to make things pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If you promise not to snap my head off, I’d
like to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Forget it. I didn’t do it for you. His voice
got on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Here you are, folks.
Candy�popcorn�cigarettes�magazines�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Here, boy!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’d you do? Wire one of your friends for
money?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No. It’d be useless. Father’d get the wire
before they would.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yes, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: A box of chocolates, please.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Never mind, son. She doesn’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: But the lady says�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Of course I do. What do you mean�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Beat it!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You have your nerve! Here, boy�!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars
last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re on a budget from now on.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Now, just a minute�you can’t�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: You won’t be able to pass till
morning.</p>
<p><strong>second policeman</strong>: Not even then, if this keeps
up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: Bridge washed out�around
Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Looks like we can’t go through till
morning.</p>
<p><strong>second policeman</strong>: Not even then, if this keeps
up.</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: Any of your passengers want a place
to sleep�there’s an auto camp up yonder a piece.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah? Where?</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: Up yonder. See the lights?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: That’s it. Dyke’s Auto Camp.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, Brat�!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Are you talking to me!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Come on�we’re stopping here for the
night.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey! Come on! We’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>dyke</strong>: Good evening. Hope you and your husband rest
comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Well, Brat�what do you say!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on! Come on! What are you going to
do?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Darn clever, these Armenians.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, it’s a gift.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I just had the unpleasant sensation of
hearing you referred to as my husband.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as
Mr. and Mrs.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, you did? What am I expected to do�leap
for joy?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I kind of half expected you to thank me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Your ego is colossal.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How’s your’s?</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! Let’s get
something straightened out right now. If you’ve any peculiar ideas that
I’m interested in you, forget it. You’re just a headline to me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: A headline? You’re not a newspaper man, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you
want to get to King Westley, don’t you? All right, I’m here to help you.
What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to-day account. All about
your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me
I’ve got to have it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Now isn’t that just too cute? There’s a brain
behind that face of yours, isn’t there? You’ve got everything nicely
figured out, for yourself, including this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This? Oh, that’s a matter of simple
mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I’m very sorry to
inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won’t stand for our having
separate establishments.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but�
you’ve been very kind.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah? It’s all right with me. Go on out
in the storm, but I’m going to follow you, see? Yeah. And if you get
tough I’ll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?
Now that’s my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple
people. Now if you behave yourself, I’ll see that you get to King
Westley; if not, I’ll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of
these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That, I suppose, makes everything�uh�quite
all right.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, this?�I like privacy when I retire. I’m
very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you mind joining the Israelites?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re not really serious about this, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: I once knew a chap who kept his hat
on until he was completely undressed.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Years later his secret came out. He wore a
toupee.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You’ll
notice my coat came first�then the tie�then the shirt�now, according to
Hoyle, the pants should come next. But that’s where I’m different.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Smart aleck!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Still with me, Brat? Don’t be a sucker. A
night’s rest’ll do you a lot of good. Besides, you’ve got nothing to
worry about. The Walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad
wolf.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You haven’t got a trumpet by any chance, have
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not even a mouth organ.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Do you mind putting out the light?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you mind taking those things off the Walls
of Jericho? It’s tough enough as it is.</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: Oh, excuse me. Ellie’s side of the
room appears, showing her crawling quickly into bed, pulling the covers
over her and glancing apprehensively in Peter’s direction�following
which a close view shows PETER being very conscious of her proximity.
The situation is delicate and dangerous; the room is atingle with sex.
He turns his gaze toward the blanket. The view moves to the BLANKET,
remaining on it a moment. It is a frail barrier. The view then moves
back to Peter, whose eyes are still on the blanket, his face
expressionless. A close view of ELLIE, next shows that she, too, has her
eyes glued on the blanket, a little fearfully. She turns her head and
gazes at the ceiling for a moment. Then suddenly her eyes widen�and she
sits up abruptly.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, by the way�what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who, me? Why, I’m the whippoorwill that cries
in the night. I’m the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely
face.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’ve got a name, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter Warne? I don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t let it bother you. You’re giving it
back to me in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne . . .</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The pleasure is all mine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve been thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ve had a pretty tough break at that.
Twice a Missus and still unkissed.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: I’ll bet you’re in an awful hurry to
get back to New York, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Goodnight, Mr. Warne.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>first pilot</strong>: The old man’s screwy!</p>
<p><strong>second pilot</strong>: What’s ’at?</p>
<p><strong>first pilot</strong>: I said, the old man’s screwy!</p>
<p><strong>second pilot</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>first pilot</strong>: The dame’s too smart for him.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Here’s another wire, sir. This one’s from
Charleston.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Any others?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yessir. There’s a report here from every
State along the East coast. Want to hear them?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What do they say?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: They’re practically all the same,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Amateurs!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: They’re the finest detective agency in
the country, sir.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I thought I made it clear I was in a hurry
to get to New York? What are we crawling for!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We’ve got her wide open, sir.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well, step on it! Step on it!</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: I hope she’s all right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Of course she’s all right. What do you
think can happen!</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Nothing, sir!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Then shut up about it!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Darn planes�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey�you not up yet? Come on�come on!</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Eight o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Here�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What is it? Why, it’s a toothbrush! Thanks.
You�you had it pressed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, you sweet thing, you. Where’d you get it
pressed?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, Brat�I’m going to count to ten. If
you’re not out of bed by then I’m going to yank you out myself.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: One�two�three�four�five</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, you bully. I believe you would.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: �six�seven�eight�nine�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m out! I’m out!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ll find the showers�and things�right back
of the second cottage.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Outside!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Certainly, outside. All the best homes have
’em outside.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I can’t go out like this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Like this. I have no robe.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Here�take mine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But make it snappy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Where’d you say the showers�and
things�were?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey�you’re little, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Where is the shower?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your hair’s cute like that. You should never
comb it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’ll find it myself.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Can’t a body have some privacy around
here?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Don’t she look funny, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Hello, sister.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Sorry about last night. Didn’t know you
were married to that guy. Shoulda told me about it right off. There I
was, gettin’ myself all primed for a killin’, and you turn out to be an
old married woman.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Hey, what’s this? Wearing Papa’s things?
Now that’s cute. That’s what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If you don’t get out of here, I’ll slap that
fresh mouth of yours.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Sorry�I didn’t mean to�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Okay. I was just trying to make
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: High time you got back.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I met some very interesting women at the
showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time
files.</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: We must come back to this place
often. You meet the nicest people!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I saw the little Pussinfoos girl. She’s
turned out quite a charming creature.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny.
Wasn’t that cute?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hurry up and get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, Peter! Don’t you want to hear about our
lovely friends?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you didn’t waste so much time on that
wise-cracking drummer�we’d have been through with breakfast by this
time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, I hope you’re not going to dictate whom
I can talk to.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know a couple of truck drivers I’d like to
have you meet sometime. Come on, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank you. My, my! Scrambled eggs.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Egg. One egg�doughnuts�black coffee. That’s
your ration till lunch. Any complaints?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Nope. No complaints.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’d have gotten you some cream but it meant
buying a whole pint.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, you don’t have to apologize, Mr. Warne.
You’ll never know how much I appreciate all this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Must be the Spring.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought maybe�uh�“believe you me” told you
a couple of snappy stories.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He apologized for last night. Said he didn’t
know we were married.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just shows you how wrong a guy can be.
Doughnut?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thanks. You think this whole business is
silly, don’t you? I mean running away and everything.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. No. It’s too good a story.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes, you do. You think I’m a fool and a
spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don’t see how I can be. People
who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On
the contrary, I’ve always been told what to do and how to do it and
where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I’ve
ever been alone with a man!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s a wonder I’m not panic stricken.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Um. You’re doing all right.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even
body-guards. Oh, it’s been a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: One consolation; you can never be
lonesome.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It has its moments. It got to be a sort of
game to try to outwit father’s detectives. I�I did it once; actually
went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely
immoral. But it didn’t last long. They caught up with me in a department
store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car
I saw. Guess who was in it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Santa Claus?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: King�King Westley was in it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh. Is that how you met him?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father
was frantic. By 6 o’clock he was having all the rivers dragged.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Say, where did you learn to dunk, in
finishing school?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Aw, now, don’t you start telling me I
shouldn’t dunk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course you shouldn’t. You don’t know how
to do it. Dunking’s an art. Don’t let it soak so long. A dip and plop,
into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it’ll get soft and fall
off. It’s all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thanks, professor.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and
you don’t know how to dunk.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’d change places with a plumber’s daughter
any day.</p>
<p><strong>dyke</strong>: You can’t go around bothering my tenants. I
tell you, there’s no girl by that name here. Besides, how do I know
you’re detectives?</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Show him your credentials, Mac.
I’ll look around.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Detectives!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s Father at work, What’ll I do?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t look at me. I didn’t marry King
Westley.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Maybe I could jump out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Come here, you little fool!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She
says if we don’t stop over at Wilkes-Barre she’ll never forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The baby is due next month�and they want us
to come.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: She says she saw your sister Ethel
the other day, and she’s looking swell.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: I hope Aunt Betty has a boy, don’t
you? She’s always wanted a boy. I think we’ll stop over in Wilkes-Barre
this trip, darling. Give the family a treat.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: There’s a man here to see you,
Sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Who�me? Want to see me?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Are you addressing me?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Yeah. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! You’re talking to my
wife! You can’t walk in here and�what do you want, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: We’re looking for somebody.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, look your head off�but don’t come
bustin’ in here. This isn’t a public park.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I got a good mind to sock you right in the
nose.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Take it easy, son. Take it
easy.</p>
<p><strong>second detective</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>dyke</strong>: These men are detectives, Mr. Warne.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wouldn’t care if they were the whole police
department. They can’t come in here and start shooting questions at my
wife!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Don’t get excited, Peter. They just asked a
civil question.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There you go again! How many times did I tell
you to stop butting in when I have an argument?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, you don’t have to lose your temper!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t have to lose your temper!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He didn’t make a pass at me! I told you a
million times!</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Oh, no! I saw him! He kept pawing you
all over the dance floor!</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: He didn’t! You were drunk!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, so now I was drunk!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, you were!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t take another sock at
him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aw, nuts! You’re just like your old man! Once
a plumber always a plumber! There isn’t an ounce of brains in your whole
family!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter Warne, you’ve gone far enough. I won’t
stand being insulted like this another minute.</p>
<p><strong>dyke</strong>: Now look what you’ve done!</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Warne. But you see,
we’re supposed to check up on everybody.</p>
<p><strong>second detective</strong>: We’re looking for a girl by the
name of Ellen Andrews. You know�the daughter of the big Wall Street
mug.</p>
<p><strong>first detective’s voice</strong>: Your wife sure looks like
her. Don’t she, Mac?</p>
<p><strong>second detective’s voice</strong>: She sure does.</p>
<p><strong>dyke’s voice</strong>: I told you they were a perfectly nice
married couple.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’ll be a dirty trick on Aunt Betty if it
turns out to be a girl after all.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like
that. Got a brain, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You weren’t so bad yourself.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We could start a two-person stock company. If
things get tough�we can play some small town auditoriums. We’ll call
this one “The Great Deception.”</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Next week “East Lynne.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: After that “The Three Musketeers.”</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How about Cinderella�or a real hot love
story?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No mushy stuff. I’m running this troupe.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I did! It was my idea, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You always want to run everything.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you don’t like it, you can resign from the
company.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I refuse to resign!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then I’ll fire you. I’ll do all the parts
myself.</p>
<p><strong>dyke</strong>: Your bus leaves in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Holy jumping�! We haven’t started to pack
yet!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Here’s another wire from Peter Warne.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Throw it in the basket.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Collect?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Don’t accept any more.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Three days! Three whole days! And what have
you accomplished!� All you’ve shown me is a stack of feeble reports from
those comical detectives of yours. I want action, Lovington!</p>
<p><strong>lovington</strong>: We can’t do the impossible,
Mr. Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What I’m asking isn’t impossible. My
daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!</p>
<p><strong>lovington</strong>: I’ve put extra men on, all along the
way.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: It’s not enough! Are you certain she’s not
with King Westley?</p>
<p><strong>lovington</strong>: No. He’s been trailed twenty-four hours a
day since this thing started. He can’t even get a phone call we don’t
know about.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’m worried, Lovington. After all,
something might have happened to her.</p>
<p><strong>one of them</strong>: Yessir?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Oh, Clark�want you to arrange for a radio
broadcast�right away�coast to coast hook-up! Offer a reward of ten
thousand dollars for any information leading to her whereabouts.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Brown�</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Yessir?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Send the story out to the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>ten thousand dollars reward”</strong>: The view then draws
back to reveal SHAPELEY reading the newspaper. He stares long and
absorbedly at the picture. Then slowly he turns his head toward the rear
of the bus, and the view following his gaze passes a group of men
singing “The Man On the Flying Trapeze.” They are huddled together, and
accompanied by a man who plays a guitar. Then the view continues moving
until it reaches Peter and Ellie who join in the song, and a close-up of
ELLIE shows her eyes sparkling as she sings gaily.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What’sa matter, Ma? Don’t you feel all
right?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter! There’s something the matter with that
woman. She looks ill.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be
tough on an old woman�a trip like this.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, Galli-Curci, come on�get onto it! You,
too, McCormack.</p>
<p><strong>ellie and peter</strong>: “O-o-o-oh�He flies through the air
with the</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank the man for me, Peter. This is the
first comfortable position I’ve had all night.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: “She flies through the air with the greatest
of ease.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Ma! Ma! What’sa matter with you? Somebody help
me! Somethin’s happened to her!</p>
<p><strong>peter.</strong>: Get some water, somebody. Let me get in
here, son.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s better. You’re all right now. Just
took a little nose-dive, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Ma�oh, gee, Ma�!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on, son. Better give your mother a
chance to snap out of it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’d better rest. It’s been a hard trip,
hasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: We ain’t ate nothin’ since yestidday.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened to your money?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn’t
know it was gonna be so much.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Going without food is bad business, son. Why
didn’t you ask somebody?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn’t let me. She
was ashamed, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: She’ll be all right, soon’s she gets
something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Here, boy�first town we come to, buy some
food.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I shouldn’t oughta take this. Ma’ll be
angry.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Just don’t tell her anything about it. You
don’t want her to get sick again, do you?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No-o. But I shouldn’t oughta take the money.
You might need it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Me? Forget it, son. I got millions.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Come on. Let’s go back to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: That storm sure made a mess outa these
roads.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Phone for help? We’re right in the middle of
nowhere. There isn’t a town within ten miles of here.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Looks like we’re going to be stuck for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Say, Buddy�</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Like to have a look at my paper?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Travelin’ like this, you kinda lose track
of what’s goin’ on in the world.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you
gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Take that story there, for instance. Be
kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah�wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: It’s a lotta dough. If I was to run across
that dame, you know what I’d do?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: I’d go fifty-fifty with you .</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Cause I’m a guy that don’t believe in
hoggin’ it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight
ball, is what I always say.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Five G’s�or I crab the works.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re a pretty shrewd baby. We better get
away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the
man I need.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: You’re not making any mistake, believe you
me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can use a smart guy like you.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Say listen, when you’re talkin’ to old man
Shapeley, you’re talking to�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you pack a gat?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A gat! A gat! Got any fireworks on you?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Why�no�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s all right. I got a couple of machine
guns in my suitcase. I’ll let you have one of them.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: If you come through all right, your
five G’s are in the bag. Maybe more. I’ll talk to the “Killer”�see that
he takes care of you.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: The Killer?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: You’re not kidnapping her, are you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What else, stupid! You don’t think we’re
after that penny-ante reward, do you?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Say, look! I didn’t know it was anything
like this, see�and�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the matter with you! Gettin’
yellow?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: But I’m a married man. I got a couple of
kids. I can’t get mixed up with�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sh-sh-sh�! Soft pedal, you mug!�before I�
What’re you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it! Now listen,
you’re in this thing�and you’re staying in! Get me? You know too
much.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: I won’t say anything. Honest, I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah ?�How do I know?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: You can trust me, Mister. I’ll keep my
mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>peter.</strong>: Yeah? What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Oscar Shapeley.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Orange, New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Got a couple of kids, huh?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Yeah. Just babies.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You love them, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Oh, gee, Mister�you wouldn’t�you ain’t
thinkin’ about�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ll keep your trap shut, all right.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Sure�sure�I’ll keep my trap shut. you can
depend on me, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you don’t�Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big
mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was
found in the bottom of the</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Gee! That musta been terrible. I guess he
had it coming to him though. But don’t you worry about me. I don’t talk.
I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn’t want anything to
happen to my kids.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew
you guys were kind-hearted.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on, scram! And stay away from that
bus.</p>
<p><strong>shapeley</strong>: Sure. Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn’t have
frightened him like that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: At the rate he started, he’s probably passed
two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat
lately. Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I was never built for these moonlight
strolls. Why did we have to leave the bus?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t trust that chatterbox.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: First town we hit in the morning, you better
wire your father.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Not as long as I’m alive.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation
diet.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What do you mean�starvation?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It takes money to buy food.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, haven’t you�?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not a sou. I had some before the fainting
scene.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You didn’t give that boy all your money?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I didn’t give him anything . You were the
big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Never! I’ll get to New York if I have to
starve all the way.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Must be some strange power Westley has over
you women. How do you expect to get there?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: To New York?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m following you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aren’t you afraid of me?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay. Hang on to these.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wish you’d stop being playful.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s the first time I’ve ridden “piggy-back”
in years.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This isn’t “piggy-back.”</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Of course it is.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And he carried you like this, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your father didn’t know beans about
“piggy-back” riding.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think there’s a “piggy-back” rider in
your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good
“piggy-back” rider.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s silly.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: To be a “piggy-backer” it takes complete
relaxation�a warm heart�and a loving nature.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And rich people have none of those
qualifications, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not a one.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re prejudiced.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Show me a good “piggy-back” rider and I’ll
show you somebody that’s human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance�a
natural “piggy-backer.” Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt
family? Why, your father knew so much about “piggy-back” riding that
he�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Aw, nuts!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: My father was a great “piggy-backer.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hold this a minute.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This looks like the best spot.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: We’re not going to sleep out here, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know about you, but I’m going to give
a fairly good imitation of it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No, it isn’t. I’m hungry and�and scared.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: You can’t be hungry and scared at the
same time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, I am.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you’re scared it scares the hunger out of
you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Not if you’re more hungry than scared.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All right. You win. Let’s forget it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I can’t forget it. I’m still hungry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with
you!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If I had any sense, I’d have been in New York
by this time. viciously at the hay as both of them Taking a married
woman back to her husband. Hunh! What a prize sucker I turned out to be.
Come on�your bed’s all ready.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’ll get my clothes all wrinkled.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, take them off.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All right! Don’t take them off. Do whatever
you please. But shut up about it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re becoming terribly disagreeable lately.
Snap my head off every time I open my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter� but nothing stirs, and there is more
Peter!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, Peter�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s got into you?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, Peter! I was so scared.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wasn’t gone more than a minute. Just went
out to find you something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I know�but�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Here. Eat your head off.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t want it now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thought you were hungry!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I was�but�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But what!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I was so scared�that it scared�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Might get chilly later on. Better use
this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’ve had a lot of men crazy about you,
haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I guess you’ve pretty much had your own way
with them. That’s your trouble mostly. You’ve always had your own way.
That’s why you’re such a mess now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know what generally happens to people
like you? You get your values all mixed up. You attach all the
importance to the wrong things. Right now, for instance, there’s only
one thought in your mind�to get back to king Westley.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Comical part of it is, it isn’t what
you want at all. In a couple of weeks you’ll be looking for the nearest
exit . . . People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I
guess that’s what makes you so dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Do you know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nothing. Nothing you’d give two cents
for.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: I just want to be let alone, that’s
all. Life’s swell if you don’t try too hard. Most people want to get a
strangle-hold on it. They’re not living. They’re just feverish. If they
didn’t get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values,
they’d find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to
it, what’s all the shootin’ for, will you tell me? After all, you can
only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed� Right now, that hay
feels pretty good to you, doesn’t it? Sure it does. ’Cause you were
tired�and it’s the only thing around.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You sound like a hobo.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I am. I only work when I have to. Two years
ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell!
After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach
for six months. What could be sweeter?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Doesn’t sound very exciting.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I guess not. I’d have given odds it wouldn’t
mean anything to you. There were moments when I had hopes. When I�aw,
I’m wasting time�You’re destined to be a dope the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of
you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames
like you so dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’d you say we’re supposed to be
doing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hitch-hiking.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, you’ve given me a very good example of
the hiking� where does the hitching come in?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A little early yet. No cars out yet.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If it’s just the same to you, we’ll sit right
here till they come. Got a toothpick?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. But I’ve got a penknife.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hay�in my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There it is. Better swallow it. We’re not
going to have any breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Needn’t rub it in. pocket and starts nibbling
on it; Ellie What’re you eating?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Carrots.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raw?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh-huh. Want one?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t think I’m going around panhandling
for you. Best thing in the world for you�carrots. Had a tough time
getting them. If that farmer ever caught me�goodnight!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I hate the horrid stuff.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wish you wouldn’t talk too much. We let a
car get away.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What if nobody stops for us?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, they’ll stop, all right. It’s a matter of
knowing how to hail them.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re an expert, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called
the “Hitch-Hikers Hail.”</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: There’s no end to your accomplishments.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You think it’s simple, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, it is simple. It’s all in the thumb,
see? A lot of people do it�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tch! Tch! I’m sorry for the poor things.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But the thumb always works. Different ways to
do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a
short, jerky movement� That shows independence. You don’t care if they
stop or not. ’Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Clever.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Number two is a wider movement�a smile goes
with that one�like this. That means you got a couple of brand new
stories about the farmer’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You figured that all out yourself, huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, that’s nothing. Now take number three,
for instance. That’s a pip. It’s the pathetic one. When you’re broke�and
hungry�and everything looks black. It’s a long movement like this� �with
a follow through.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hm? Yeah, but it’s no good if you haven’t got
a long face with it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Here comes a car!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Now watch me. I’m going to use Number One.
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m still watching your thumb.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Something must have gone wrong. I guess I’ll
try number two.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I guess maybe I won’t write that book after
all.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. But look at all the fun you had.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You! Don’t make me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You’re such a smart aleck! Nobody can do
anything but you. I’ll show you how to stop a car�and I won’t use my
thumb.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’re you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Mind your own business.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You might give me a little credit.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I proved once and for all that the limb is
mightier than the thumb.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why didn’t you take all your clothes off? You
could have stopped forty cars.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: We don’t need forty cars.</p>
<p><strong>danker</strong>: So you’ve just been married, huh? Well,
that’s pretty good. If I was young, that’s just the way I’d spend my
honeymoon�hitch-hiking. Y-e-s s-i-r!</p>
<p><strong>danker</strong>: “Hiking down the highway of love on a
honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, hey, aren’t you afraid you’ll burn out a
tonsil?</p>
<p><strong>danker</strong>: Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil? “My
tonsils won’t burn�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All right, let it go.</p>
<p><strong>danker</strong>: . . . turn.”</p>
<p><strong>danker</strong>: How about a bite to eat?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, I think that would be�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, thanks. We’re not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>danker</strong>: Oh, I see, young people in love are never
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>danker</strong>: “Young people in love</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a
meal?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why not? I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Eat a carrot.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Never! I’m going in and ask him�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you do, I’ll break your neck.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let’s get out and stretch our legs.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on�get in.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, you’ve been hurt! There’s a cut on�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on! come on!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs
off with their stuff. What a racket!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’d you give him for the car?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A black eye.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Look�uh�how are the�uh�carrots holding out?
Any left?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t have to eat the carrots.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Haven’t much gas left in this thing. Got to
start promoting some. Better take the things out of the pocket of that
coat. Ought to be good for ten gallons.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I haven’t changed my mind, Westley, I want
you to understand that! I don’t like you! I never have! I never will!
That’s clear enough, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: You’ve made that quite evident�with all your
threats of annulment. Well, it hasn’t bothered me for a minute. Ellie
and I got married because we love each other. And she’s proving it; as
far as I’m concerned there’s going to be no annulment.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’ve got a good thing and you’re hanging
on to it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: I might have been able to help if it
weren’t for you. I’ve been watched so closely, I�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I
issued a statement yesterday that I’ve withdrawn my objections. Begging
her to come home. I haven’t heard from her. Apparently she doesn’t trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: Why should she? After all�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: All right. That’s why I sent for you.</p>
<p><strong>westley</strong>: If you really mean it, I will.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Of course I mean it! I don’t care whom
she’s married to� �as long as I can get her back. As Andrews opens the
door, a number of reporters enter.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Come in, boys. This is my�uh�this is King
Westley. He has a statement to make.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Hello, Westley . . . How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>andrews withdraws objection</strong>: Magnate and Aviator
Reconciled “Everything all right. Come home, darling,” says Westley.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: All right, Brat.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a
room.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What about money?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Talked him out of it. He thinks we’re going
to stay a week. I’ll have to think of something before morning.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s swell!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m glad you think so. If you ask me, it’s
foolish. I told you there’s no sense in our staying here tonight. We
could make New York in less than three hours.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I couldn’t arrive in New York at three in the
morning. Everybody’s in bed.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay. Cottage Number Three.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: There you go�trustin’ people again. How many
times did I tell you�</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: He looked like an upright young feller to me,
Ma.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yeah. They’re all upright till they walk out
on you.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Said he was gonna stay a week.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Mebbe.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for
security.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I don’t trust him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, here we are on the last lap.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Tomorrow morning, you’ll be in the arms of
your husband.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. You’ll have a great story, won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, swell.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Yep! The Walls of Jericho.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We certainly outsmarted your father.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Am I going to see you in New York?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t make it a policy to run around with
married women.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No harm in your coming to see us.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Won’t I ever see you again?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What do you want to see me for? I’ve served
my purpose. I brought you back to King Westley, didn’t I? That’s what
you wanted, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Peter, have you ever been in love?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I probably did the world a great favor at
that. Got two pinheads out of circulation.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Haven’t you ever wanted to fall in love?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. Haven’t you thought about it at all?
Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe. Sure�sure, I’ve thought about it. Who
hasn’t? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I’d� Yeah, but where you
going to find her�somebody that’s real�somebody that’s alive? They don’t
come that way any more.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve even been sucker enough to make plans. I
saw an island in the Pacific once. Never been able to forget it. That’s
where I’d like to take her. But she’d have to be the sort of a girl
that’d jump in the surf with me on moonlight nights�and love it as much
as I did.</p>
<p><strong>peter’s voice</strong>: Certainly I’ve been thinking about
it. Boy, if I could ever find a girl who’s hungry for those things�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m going to Swim in the surf with her�I’m
going to reach up and grab stars for her�I’m going to laugh with her�and
cry with her. I’m going to kiss her wet lips�and�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Take me with you, Peter. Take me to your
island. I want to do all those things you talked about.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Better go back to your bed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re forgetting you’re married.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t care. I love you. Nothing else
matters. We can run away. Everything’ll take care of itself. Please,
Peter. You can’t go out of my life now. I couldn’t live without you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Better go back to your bed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, Brat�! Did you mean that? Would you
really go? Hey, Brat�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All I’m asking is enough gas to get me to New
York. The bag’s worth twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, man�I’ll tell you what I’ll do. When
I come back in the morning, I’ll buy it back from you and give you ten
dollars profit? What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I ain’t got a hat�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I ain’t got a hat.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, you got one now. �Come on, fill ’er
up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fine! That’s fine, Tony. Now get me a drink
and make sure nobody disturbs me for half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>italian</strong>: Sure. Sure, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello, Agnes.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Better not go in. He’ll shoot you on
sight.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I haven’t been shot at for days.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wait a minute, Gordon�I�</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Joe, listen�</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Don’t “Joe” me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay, Joe. Listen�you know I’ve always liked
you. Anytime I could do you a great turn�anytime I ran into a story that
looked good�I always came running to you, didn’t I? Well, I got one now.
Those wires I sent you were on the level. It’s the biggest scoop of the
year. I’m giving it to you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You mean about the Andrews’ kid?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s it. I got it all written up. Ready to
go. All I want is a thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: A thousand dollars! Get out of this office
before I throw you out bodily.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t get sore, Joe. This is something you
got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars�and I need it quick. I’m in
a jam.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What’s the thousand bucks for?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: To tear down the Walls of Jericho.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Never mind . . . Listen�suppose I should tell
you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That she’s going to marry somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Would an exclusive story like that be worth a
thousand bucks to you?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: If it’s on the level.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I got it, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Who’s she gonna marry?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I wouldn’t trust you as far as I could throw
that desk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn’t
afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I’d be crazy. There isn’t a
newspaper in the country’d give me a job after that! I could go to
jail!</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: I’d put you there myself.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure. I wouldn’t blame you, either.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Who’s the guy she’s gonna marry?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I am, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Now I know you’re drunk. I’m going home.
Don’t annoy me any more.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: For heaven’s sake, Joe�stop being an editor
for just a minute. We’ve been friends for a long time, haven’t we? You
ought to know when I’m serious. This is on the level.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been
with her every minute. I’m in love with her, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Well, I’ll be�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, Pal�you’ve got to get this money for
me. Now. Minutes count. She’s waiting for me in an auto camp outside of
Philadelphia. I’ve got to get right back. You see, she doesn’t know I’m
gone. A guy can’t propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can
he?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What a story! On her way to join her
husband, Ellen Andrews falls in love with� Lemme see that a minute.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I told you! I told you, you couldn’t trust
him! He’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: That feller last night, that’s who! He was
gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he’s skipped. Took the car with him, too.
We wouldn’t have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn’t took
that magnesia. Come on, get up, don’t lay there. Let’s do something
about it.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: See that. They’re gone!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Looks like it, don’t it? Here’s the woman,
ma.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Oh!!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: owner and his wife come up to her;
timidly�sitting What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Where’s your husband, young lady�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Husband?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yes�if he is your husband.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Isn’t he here?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: No, he ain’t! And the car’s gone, too.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, he’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his
suitcase and everything. Kinda surprised, huh? It’s just like I told
you, Zeke. They ain’t married a’tall . . .</p>
<p><strong>wife’s voice</strong>: . . . could tell she was a hussy just
from the looks of her.</p>
<p><strong>owner’s voice</strong>: Hey! You! Got any money?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why�no.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Then�you’ll have to git !</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Yeah, you’ll have to git .</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why, you can’t put me out in the middle of
the�</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you
take up with on the road. You can’t go plyin’ your trade in my camp.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: But can’t you wait until morning�</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Ain’t gonna wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Not a minute!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Better start gettin’ into your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Zeke. Git!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Yes, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to
New York.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: You ain’t gonna stick me for no phone calls.
You can go down to the Sheriff’s office.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: And listen, next time better keep away from
here. I run a respectable place.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Okay, pete. escorts peter out, his arm
around his For my dough, you’re still the best newspaperman in the
business.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: S’long, kid. And good luck.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: ’Bye, Agnes. You’re beautiful. All women are
beautiful! Gordon is immediately electrified into action.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: There’s Hank.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Hank! Listen. Hold the morning edition.
Break down the front page. Gonna have a completely new layout�Send a
couple of re-write men in here. Don’t do a thing�I got a story that’ll
make your hair curl.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Don’t annoy me. I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What!�Ellen Andrews! You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Yeah. She just phoned her father from an
auto camp to come and get her. He’s getting a police escort. Westley’s
going along, too. She’s been traveling by bus. The moment she read that
her father and Westley made up, she phoned in.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You sure that’s right! Say, you haven’t been
drinking, have you! Okay�grab a car�and stay with them. Put Hank on.
Agnes! Get me a doctor. I’m about to have a nervous breakdown.
Hank�forget everything I just told you. I was just having a nightmare!
Call up the police department! Tell ’em to find Peter Warne. Send out a
general alarm. I want the dirty crook pinched.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: You want us?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yeah. Shove everything off the front page.
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father�she’s coming home. The moment she
heard the old man withdrew his objections, she gave herself up. Spread
it all over the place. Here’s your lead: “Love Triumphant!” Step on
it!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: I knew she was safe.</p>
<p><strong>lovington</strong>: Certainly gave us a run for our
money.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Can’t you get them to go any faster?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: “I found a million dollar baby�”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on, Dobbin, old boy. We got a police
escort.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Dobbin, me lad. You failed muh. I’m afraid
you’re gittin’ old.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Will you make a statement Miss Andrews?
Was it an exciting experience? How did you travel?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Later, boys, later. See her at home.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Take it easy, Dobbin. Remember your blood
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Better get that toy train out of here. I’m in
a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>“glad to be home says ellen”</strong>: This dissolves to the
anteroom of a NEWSPAPER OFFICE. The place is alive with activity, and
copies of newspapers are lying around, bearing headlines relating to the
Andrews story. Peter, a bewildered, stunned expression on his face,
enters and crosses funereally toward Gordon’s office. Several people
standing around look up.</p>
<p><strong>people</strong>: Hi, Pete�Didya see this? Ellen Andrews is
back. Gonna marry that Westley guy after all�What a dame! What a
dame!</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Gordon’s out back some place.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: See that he gets that, will you, Agnes? Tell
him I was just kidding. As Agnes stares after him, puzzled, Gordon
dashes in from a back door.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: You can’t get a thing done around her
unless�</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Peter Warne was just in.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Huh? What?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Left this money. Said to tell you he was just
kidding.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>gordon’s voice</strong>: Hey, Pete!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine.
Thought I’d have some fun with you.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wouldn’t have made a bad story, would it?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Great! But that’s the way things go. You
think you got a swell yarn�then something comes along�messes up the
finish�and there you are.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, where am I?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well, here we are; it’s all set. You’re
finally going to be married properly.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Why; naturally, I�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Naturally. You’re going to become a partner
in a big institution. It’s one of the largest in the world.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: You talk as if�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Someday perhaps, you might even take
charge.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The thought of it makes me shudder.</p>
<p><strong>king’s voice</strong>: You might be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I hope so. However, that’ll take care of
itself. There’s another responsibility you’re taking on. One that I’m
really concerned about.</p>
<p><strong>king’s voice</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: My daughter.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Ellie? Oh, she’s no responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: No? Say, listen�I’ve devoted a whole
lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever
hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn’t he? Well, I
tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I’ve browbeaten
financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers�some of the most powerful
people in the world�but I’ve never been able to do a thing with her.
She’s been too much for me. I’m glad you think it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: What would you like to have me do?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Sock her!</p>
<p><strong>andrews’ voice</strong>: Sock her at least once a day. Do it
on general principles. Make her know you’re the boss and never let her
forget it. Think you can do that?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: It’s quite an assignment�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Try. Do me a favor. Try. It’s your only
chance. And hers, too. Do that for me�and maybe we’ll be friends� Maybe.
Do we understand each other?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Fine. I’ll see you at the reception.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Oh, by the way, Mr Andrews, I thought of a
great stunt for the reception.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You thought that up all by yourself,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Why, it’ll make all the front pages. A
spectacular thing like that�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Personally, I think it’s stupid! But go
ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn’t object.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Oh, no. She’ll be crazy about it. Well, see
you later. I’m going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: We’ve done that already.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Autogyro! I hope he breaks his leg.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Oh�Mary�</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why�uh�she’s all right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What’s the matter? Anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, no, sir. No different than�</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yessir. If you’ll excuse me, sir�she sent me
for a drink. Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the
stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in
front of Ellie’s door. Andrews enters and knocks several times.
Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Ellie�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, hello, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well, everything’s set. Creating quite a
furor, too. Great stunt King’s going to pull.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Stunt?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, yes. I heard.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Yes. Personally, I think it’s silly,
too.</p>
<p><strong>andrews’ voice</strong>: You look lovely. Are you pleased
with the gown? Ellie!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What’s the matter, Ellie? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’ve been acting so strangely since you
returned. I’m�I’m worried. I haven’t bothered to ask you any
questions�I�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: If you have, it isn’t too late. You know
how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a
scare�I�when I couldn’t find you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sorry, Dad. I wouldn’t hurt you for the
world. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Ellie�what is it? Aren’t you happy,
child?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I thought so. I knew there was something on
your mind.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: What is it, darling? You haven’t fallen in
love with somebody else, have you?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Have you? Ellie now rises and walks
miserably away from him, dabbing her eyes. Andrews, watching her,
realizes he has hit upon the truth. He walks over to her.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I haven’t seen you cry since you were a
baby. This must be serious. Where’d you meet him?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: On the road.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Now, don’t tell me you fell in love with a
bus driver!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t know very much about him. Except that
I love him.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well, if it’s as serious as all that�we’ll
move heaven and earth to�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’ll do no good. He despises me.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Oh, come now�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He despises everything I stand for. He thinks
I’m spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He doesn’t think so much of you either.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He blames you for everything that’s wrong
about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Fine man to fall in love with.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He’s marvelous!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well, what are we going to do about it?
Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’d like to have a talk with him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s no use, Dad. I practically threw myself
at him.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Well, under the circumstances, don’t you
think we ought to call this thing off?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No, I’ll go through with it.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: But that’s silly, child. Seeing how you
feel, why�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It doesn’t matter. I don’t want to stir up
any more trouble. I’ve been doing it all my life. I’ve been such a
burden to you�made your life so miserable�and mine, too. I’m tired, Dad.
Tired of running around in circles. He’s right, that’s what I’ve been
doing ever since I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>ellie’s voice</strong>: I’ve got to settle down. It really
doesn’t matter how�or where�or with whom.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’ve changed, Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes, I guess I have. I don’t want to hurt
anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity.
It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can’t walk out on
King now. It’ll make us all look so ridiculous. Besides, what difference
does it make?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Is that his name?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yes. Peter Warne.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Peter Warne!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why? Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Oh, no�no.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You haven’t heard from him, have you,
Dad?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Why, no . . . Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, please, Dad�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Looks like that was his only interest in me.
The reward.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’m sorry you read it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Are you going to see him?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Certainly! Pay him off. He’s entitled to it.
He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It’s worth
every penny he gets.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thanks, Mary. That’s just what I need.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. King Westley is on his way up.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Fine�Fine! Have him come in.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’ll be going. Ellie swallows her drink and
starts pouring herself another, as King enters.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, if it isn’t the groom himself! You’re
just in time, King.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: How are you, Ellie? perfunctorily�but he
insists upon being Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Happy? Why shouldn’t I be happy? I’m getting
the handsomest man in captivity.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: You bet we did.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s up to you now. I want our life to be
full of excitement, King. We’ll never let up, will we? Never a dull
moment. We’ll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you’ll
never let me get off? It’s the only way to live, isn’t it? No time to
think. We don’t want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep
going.</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Whatever you say, darling.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I heard about your stunt. That’s swell, King.
Just think of it�the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It’s a
perfect beginning for the life we’re going to lead. It sets just the
right tempo.</p>

and King Westley Resumed, as Father Yields. Wedding Reception to be Held
on Andrews’ Lawn.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello . . . Yes? . . . Who? . . . Oh . . .
Why can’t I see you at your office?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I leave for Washington tonight. May be gone
several weeks. Thought perhaps you’d like to get this thing settled.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t like the idea of walking in
on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me�those things give me a
stiff pain.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You needn’t see anybody. You can come
directly to my study. I’d appreciate it very much if�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No�no. What the deuce do I want to�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, wait a minute. Maybe I will come over.
I’d like to get a load of that three-ring circus you’re pulling. I want
to see what love looks like when it’s triumphant. I haven’t had a good
laugh in a week. Then the LAWN of the ANDREWS ESTATE dissolves in. It is
now filled with guests, who wander around, chattering gaily. The
orchestra plays. A captain of waiters in the foreground instructs his
men.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I want everything to be just so. When the
ceremony starts, you stand on the side�still . No moving around�no
talking, comprenez ?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Keep your eye on my car when you’re backing
up, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Show him in.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Mr. Warne?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Come in. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s typical of your daughter. Takes those
things for granted.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Please understand me. When I say she didn’t
tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She
thinks you’re entitled to anything you can get.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, she does, huh? Isn’t that sweet of her!
You don’t , I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I don’t know. I’d have to see on what you
base your claim. I presume you feel you’re justified in�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If I didn’t I wouldn’t be here! I’ve got it
all itemized.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I sold some drawers and socks, too; I’m
throwing those in.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: And this is what you want�thirty-nine
dollars and sixty cents?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why not? I’m not charging you for the time I
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Yes, I know�but�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s the matter? Isn’t it cheap enough? A
trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Let me get this straight. You want this
thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What ten thousand?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The reward.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who said anything about a reward!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I’m afraid I’m a little confused. You see,
I assumed you were coming here for�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you’ll
give me a check I’ll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You’re a peculiar chap.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ll go into that some other time.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: The average man would go after the reward.
All you seem to�</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of
you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You were taken for a buggy ride?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah�with all the trimmings. Now, how about
the check. Do I get it?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Certainly. While Andrews writes, Peter
wanders around the room in an attitude of bitter contempt. Andrews rises
and goes to him.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Here you are. Do you mind if I ask you
something frankly?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: That’s an evasion.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She grabbed herself a perfect running mate.
King Westley! The pill of the century! What she needs is a guy that’d
take a sock at her every day�whether it’s coming to her or not.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you had half the brains you’re supposed to
have, you’d have done it yourself�long ago.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Do you love her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A normal human being couldn’t live under the
same roof with her, without going nuts. She’s my idea of nothing!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I asked you a question. Do you love
her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes! But don’t hold that against me. I’m a
little screwy myself.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Perfect! Now you look natural.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I hope you got your money.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You bet I did.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Same to you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why don’t you stay and watch the fun? You’ll
enjoy it immensely.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I would. But I’ve got a weak stomach.</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: Here comes King! He’s just coming down!
Hurry up, everybody! Come on, Ellie!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I just had a long talk with him.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Now, wait a minute, Ellie�</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t want to hear anything about him!</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: That guy Warne is O.K. He didn’t want the
reward.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: All he asked for was thirty-nine dollars
and sixty cents . . . that’s what he spent on you. It was a matter of
principle with him�says you took him for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>a young girl</strong>: I wish I were in her shoes.</p>
<p><strong>second girl</strong>: Yes. She certainly is lucky.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: He loves you, Ellie. Told me so.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: You don’t want to be married to a mug like
Westley.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I can buy him off for a pot of gold, and
you can make an old man happy, and you wouldn’t do so bad for yourself.
If you change your mind, your car’s waiting at the back gate.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join
together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show
just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him speak
now or else hereafter forever hold his</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Ellen, wilt thou have this man to be thy
wedded husband so long as ye both shall live?</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: Ellie!</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: What’s happened? Where’s she going?</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Get her, Mac! She’s ducking!</p>
<p><strong>king</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Don’t want to talk to�don’t want to talk to
anybody. Don’t want to see anybody.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: But it’s King Westley on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: Ooooooh. Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law.
I’ve sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That’s the smartest
thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That’s
satisfactory, isn’t it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I’m not
complaining. It was dirt cheap. Don’t fall out of any windows.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: There’s another wire from Peter, sir.
They’re in Glen Falls, Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>andrews</strong>: “What’s holding up the annulment, you slow
poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling.” Send him a telegram right
away. Just say: “Let ’em topple.”</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Funny couple, ain’t they?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: If you ask me, I don’t believe they’re
married.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: They’re married all right. I just seen the
license.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: They made me get ’em a rope and a blanket, on
a night like this.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: What do you reckon that’s for?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Blamed if I know. I just brung ’em a
trumpet.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: A trumpet?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They
sent me to the store to get it.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: But what in the world do they want a trumpet
for?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I dunno.</p>
