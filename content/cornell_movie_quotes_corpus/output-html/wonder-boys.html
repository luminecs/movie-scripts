<h1 id="wonder-boys">wonder-boys</h1>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: ’The young girl sat perfectly still in the
confessional…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: …listening to her father’s boots scrape like
chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then grow faint, then
disappear altogether.’</p>
<p><strong>carrie mcwhirty</strong>: Let me get this straight. The girl
with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes
off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into
the house. Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working
this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning
before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a
little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession–only, once she gets in
the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he’s the mother’s
secret lover. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>carrie mcwhirty</strong>: I mean, Jesus. What is it with you
Catholics?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: All right. Let’s try to keep it constructive,
shall we? Howard, what about you?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I hated it.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s not exactly what I meant by
constructive, Howard.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I think James should try to be more
constructive. This is my second semester with him. His stories are
brutal, man. They make me want to kill myself.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes, Hannah?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I think maybe we’re missing the point.
It seems to me James’ strength as a writer is that he doesn’t take us by
the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us.
That takes . . . courage .</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on,
I think. Don’t forget about WordFest this weekend. And remember: those
of you driving V.I.P.s to tonight’s cocktail party need to have them at
the Chancellor’s house no later than 5:30.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Thanks for that. He all right?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I think so. ..What about you?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Me? Sure. Why?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Just checking.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Turn out the light, please.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for
today. This means we have no programs for the weekend. This means that
tomorrow morning, at 9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw
Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are going. It’s all right,
Elliot. I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Professor Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I got the message you called.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I got the message you called too.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Tripp!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: How are you, Crabtree?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss
Antonia. . .uh. . . .</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sloviak.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to
tonight’s festivities. You don’t mind, do you. Trip? ?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: The more the merrier.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Terry was telling me about you on the
plane. It was ail so interesting.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I was explaining to Antonia how a book
comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an
editor…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I sweat blood for five years and he checks
for spelling.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: That’s exactly what he said.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: We know each other pretty well. So where’s
Emily?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Emily?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Your wife.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh. We’re picking her up. Downtown.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Perfect. Well then, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Do you know how many times I’ve boarded an
airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly
while I’m on my way to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Lay off Pittsburgh. It’s one of the great
cities.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you’ll
get no argument from me.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She’s a transvestite.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: You’re stoned.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She’s still a transvestite.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: So how’s the book?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s fine. It’s done. Basically. I’m just
sort of. ..tinkering with it.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Great. I was hoping I could get a look at
it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t know. I’m sort of at a critical. . .
juncture .</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I thought you were tinkering.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I just mean. . .</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Forget I asked. I don’t want to pressure
you, Tripp. But… …I get pressure. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that
would be?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That would be a tuba.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That perfume you’re wearing, Antonia. It
wouldn’t happen to be Cristaile, would it?</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Why yes. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Lucky guess.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: You didn’t actually purchase this car, did
you. Trip??</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It was Jerry Nathan’s. He owed me money.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He owes God money. You know, he queered
himself for good with Esquire.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He said something about being between
things.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of
broken legs.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hi, Tanya. This is Tanya. My wife’s
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>tanya</strong>: Grady.. ..Emily’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You’re leaking, Tanya.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Trip? ?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She left me. Crabs.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Left you…? Who? Emily?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: This morning. I found a note in the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: But. ..why didn’t you say something,
Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I thought maybe I made it all up.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: That’s a nice greenhouse.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s Mrs. Gaskell’s. Her hobby.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell’s hobby,
Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Oh, I’m sure you’ll find another. You
always do.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Chancellor. Don’t you look ravishing.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Aren’t you sweet to say so. I was beginning to
wonder if you were ever going to–oh!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Easy there.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s these goddamned shoes. I don’t
know how anyone actually walks in these things.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Practice.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I don’t believe we’ve met…</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Antonia. Antonia Sloviak–</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Poe!</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: This wouldn’t be Walter’s dog, would
it?</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Who ’ s he barking at now?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He’s still barking at me. He’s blind.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Poe’ Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: That’s funny. I need to talk to you, too.
Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room,
Professor Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t believe I know where the upstairs
guest room is.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Well then. I’d better show you. Terry–</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: We’ll just make ourselves at home. Won’t
we, Poe? Yes, yes….</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: New?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Walter just got it back from the framer
today.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You go first.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: All right. This morning–</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well. This is…surprising. Does Walter… ?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I think Walter would find this a little more
than surprising.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Emily left me this morning.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: She’s left before…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She’s left the room before. She always came
back.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry
each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Simple.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Is that Cristaile?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: My God, I wear the same scent as a
transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn’t: she?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: If she’s not now, Terry will make sure she is
by the end of the evening.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Has he asked to see the book yet?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: And? Are you going to tell him?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No. Maybe. I don’t know. I don’t know what
I’m going to do.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Neither do 1.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sara, my arm. I’m stuck, honey.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I guess you’re going to have to chew it off
then.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Walter! I see you’ve met my friend.</p>
<p><strong>walter gaskell</strong>: Yes . She’ s charming.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Walter’s been telling me the most
fascinating things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?</p>
<p><strong>walter gaskell</strong>: Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia,
it’ s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of
American popular culture. Joe DiMaggio represented, metaphorically
speaking, the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be controversial,
I personally believe every woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn
Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Oh, I couldn’t agree more.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: And while my latest has been on the New York
Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can’t help but lament that my
first book, which contains what I consider my finest writing, was
remaindered in less than five. So, I find myself conflicted.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ask him if he’s conflicted about his house in
the Hamptons.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Grady.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Hello.. .Professor.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Q,. Hannah’s had two stories published in The
Paris Review. You’d best dust off the ‘A’ material for her.</p>
<p><strong>man in tweed</strong>: A supermarket for the mind, my ass.
I’m telling you, they’re nothing but a big, fat mob laundry. Have you
ever been to Davenport, Iowa? Let me tell you, they need a
30,000-square-foot bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
Grady!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hello, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>man in tweed</strong>: My God, I haven’t seen you since,
what? The PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for you, Grady.
GRADY was there for Arsonist’s Daughter,</p>
<p><strong>short man</strong>: Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not
when I say Arsonist’s Daughter belongs in the pantheon of late twentieth
century fiction. I’ve had it on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years
running.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No wonder it’s still in print.</p>
<p><strong>woman with cigarette</strong>: …can take my word for it,
writer’s are lousy fucks. Poets aren’t bad, but then you’ve got to deal
with the sweater thing. They’ll discover the cancer in your heart every
time, but God forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I could swear I had a ’63 Chateau Latour in
here. You haven’t seen it, have you?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I doubt I’d recognize a ’63 Chateau Latour if
I was sitting on it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’d recognize it if you tasted it.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I doubt it, darling.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he
will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You want to keep him happy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If he’ s happy. . . I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s fake.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It was my mother’s. She won it in a
penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s very convincing.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It used to shoot these little paper
caps, but they don’t make them anymore. The caps.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s just. ..for good luck. Some people
carry rabbits’ feet…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: …You carry firearms.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No, thank you. I don’t like to lose
control of my emotions.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m not supposed to be here, in case you
were wondering. I crashed. I mean, not intentionally…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James
?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No! What gave you that idea?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Relax, James. I’m not her father. I just rent
her a room.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: She likes old movies like I do, that’s
ail. Besides, she doesn’t really know me. She thinks she does, but she
doesn’t. Maybe it’s because she’s Mormon and I’m Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Maybe it’s because she’s beautiful and she
knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it’s
inevitable that it will in some way.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You’re not like my other teachers,
Professor Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You’re not like my other students, James. So
what was the movie you two saw?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power
and Frances Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She went crazy, Frances Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: So did Gene Tierney. She’s in it
too.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sounds like a good one.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s not bad.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Listen, James, about this afternoon. In
workshop. I’m sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: They really hated it. I think they hated
it more than any of the other ones.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It doesn’t matter. It only took me an
hour to write.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Really? That’s remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I have trouble sleeping. While I’m lying
in bed I figure them out. The stories.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You cold, James?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: So what are you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s colder in there. -</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I
thought …I thought I’d come out here and take a look at it. You don’t
see one of those every day. It looks like heaven…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Heaven?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I saw a movie once. Part of it took
place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like
that. At least that’s the way I remember it…</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I should be going.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James. Don’t leave just yet. There’s
something I think you ought to see.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’ll miss my bus.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: This is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Hey, you two.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No, I’m going ho–</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He’s going with me. You take Crabtree. And
his friend. All right?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Ail right. By the way, his
friend…?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: The answer’s yes. I think. Yes. I don’t know.
Where are they exactly?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Here we are!</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Nell, hello there.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: James’ll know about George
Sanders.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: George Sanders?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George
Sanders killed himself, only he couldn’t remember how.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava
hotel room.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: How comprehensive of you.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the
movie suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: There’s so many…</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Just a few then. The big ones.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Pier Angeli, 1971 or ’72, also pills.
Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In
a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know. . . He was
distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert
Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on
his stomach. Alan Ladd, ’64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I
forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg/
pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane– he was good–pills. Margaret
Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself
and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don’t know if you would have
heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia
Scaia?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I haven’t heard of half of those.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: You did them alphabetically.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: That’s just how my brain works, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Fascinating. Listen, why don’t you come
out with us after the lecture. There’s a place on the Hill I always get
Trip to take me.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Actually. ..I just want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Oh, don’t be silly. No one your age just
wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as
a field trip.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Is that really it?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s really it.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: The one she wore on her wedding day?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: So I’m told.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: They’re glass. The buttons.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Like the lady herself.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: She was small. Most people don’t know
that. The shoulders are small. It looks so perfect. I bet it’s the only
time she wore it. That day. She must’ve felt so …happy.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s feels unreal, like butterfly wings
or… something. It must’ve cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth
about how much he pays for these things.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You’re really good friends with the
Chancellor, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Pretty good. I’m friends with Dr. Gaskell,
too.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I guess you must be, if you know the
combination to his closet and he doesn’t mind your being here in their
bedroom like this.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: We, better skedaddle. Close that closet–
James? You ail right?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it’s
seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks…really lonely.
Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I’m just a little sad.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Maybe. I’m feeling a little sad myself
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You mean, with your wife leaving you and
ail? Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes. Well. It’s complicated, James. I think
we should go now.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell’s dog.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I had to. Didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Couldn’t you’ve just pulled him off me?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No! He was crazy. I didn’t-he looked– 1
thought –</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don’t freak out on
me.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Do you have a mirror? It’s the best way
to see if someone’s breathing.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He’s dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead
dog when I see one.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: First you’re going to give me that little cap
gun of yours.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a
question?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yea, James.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: What are we going to do with…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t know. I’m still trying to figure out
how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband’s dog.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Trust me, James, when the family pet’s been
assassinated, the owner doesn’t want to hear one of her students was the
triggerman.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Does she want to hear it was one of her
professors?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’ve got tenure.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: He’s still a little warm.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Yuck.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: That’s a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a
suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s just what they used to say in the ads.
Come on, Crabtree, I know you’re holding…</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Whose tuba is that anyway?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Miss Sloviak’s.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Can I ask you something about her?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She is. Ah. Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Oh. So. Is–is your friend Crabtree– is
he– gay?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Most of the time he is, James. Some of the
time he isn’t. Now what do we have here?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Looks like …our old friend Mr. Codeine. That
should take the pinch out of my ankle. Have one.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No thanks. I’m fine without them.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Right. That’s why you were standing in the
Chancellor’s back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight.
You’re fine, all right, you’re fit as a fucking fiddle.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m sorry, James. I’m sorry I said that.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: How ’bout we try that again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: …really needs no introduction. Walk down the
aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and you’ll see his
face beaming back at you. You all know the name, you all know the books,
so welcome if you will, the man those of us who know him simply call..
.Q.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: I am a writer.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: Grady? Grady?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You had another one, didn’t you? You have to
see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Is the thing-is it over?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Almost. Wane to sit up? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Nothing. I think I twisted my–</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I have to tell you something. Something..
.hard.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Then stand up. I’m too old for all this
roiling around on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Don’t. I know what you’re going to say.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No, really, Sara, I don’t think you–</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You love Emily. I know that. And you need to
stay with her.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t think I really have a choice in,
that. Emily left me.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: She’ll come back. That’s why I’m going to.
..to not have this baby.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Not have it.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No. There’s no way. I mean, don’t you think
there’s no way?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well, no, I don’t see any way. And I know how
hard it is for you to– to lose this chance.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No you don’t. And fuck you for saying you do.
And fuck you for “saying. . . …for saying there’s just no way. Because
there could be a way, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: He must be finishing. We should go.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Who’s gun is that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s-it’s a souvenir. Of Baltimore.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Caps.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Pow.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You got me.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I love you, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Woah! The doors made so much noise!</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: This is so embarrassing! You guys had to
carry me out.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Is he ail right?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He’s fine. He’s narrating.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: We’re going to the men’s room. Only we
might not make it in time.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you
to make that mistake, wait here.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: I need a ride.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m your man.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: There’s an explanation.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Couldn’t he have just thrown a shoe at
the poor thing?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James is. ..I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Disturbed. And when your friend
CRABTREE gets done with him, he’s going to be even more disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m not sure that’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Sure it is.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Listen, Antonia–</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Tony. Now that I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Tony. I’m sorry if things didn’t work out so
well for you tonight. With Terry.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Forget it. I should’ve known better.
Your friend is just, I don’t know, into collecting weird tricks.
Mind?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He’s writing his name in water.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Like most editors, he really wants to be a
writer, but he’s too busy living a novel to bother writing one.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: That sounds like a fancy excuse for
being a shit.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He’d call it habit. But now. ..I get the
feeling he’s going through the motions a bit.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: You mean because his career’s ruined
and all?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus. Is that what he told you?</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: He said he hasn’t had a success in ten
years and everyone in New York thinks he’s kind of .a. . .</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: …loser. But I’m sure your book is so
good that he’ll be able to keep his job.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Turn here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’’ s nice. All we have is a Japanese
beetle trap.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: It’s a bathtub. What she’s standing
under.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: There’s Pop. Let me see it. The
gun.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: Figures. It’s like the kind of gun
Bette Davis would carry. In a little beaded purse?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’d better go. I think I may have to rescue
James Leer.</p>
<p><strong>miss sloviak</strong>: You know, Grady, if I were you. I’d
think about going home. You look like you need a little rescuing
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Clean tonight, hub, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: As a whistle.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Double Dickel on the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Is that just beer?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Primarily. Although I gather you two
staged a little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You missed a few
bottles, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m sure. Where is everyone?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Sara and Walter declined. Guess they
wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus. He’s out.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He has a book.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I know. He started it Fall semester.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He finished it Winter Break.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: So. Is he any good?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No. Not yet he isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Well, I’m going to read it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Come on. Crabs. Don’t do this. He’s . one o�
my students, for Christ sake. I’m not even sure if he’s-</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He is. Take my word for it.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I think it’s more complicated than that.
Besides, he’s a little…scattered. He almost …did something stupid
tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn’t need sexual confusion
thrown into the stew right now.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: On the contrary, it ’could be just the
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Double Dickel.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: No sexual confusion there, eh,
Professor?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shut up and drink.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: President of the James Brown Hair Club For
Men.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He’s a boxer. A flyweight.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Huh uh. A jockey. His name’s, um, Curtis..
.Curtis Hardapple.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Not Curtis.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar’s
are from a–from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: And now he’s addicted to painkillers.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He can’t piss standing up anymore.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He lives with his mother.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: And he had a younger brother who . . .was
. . . a. . .</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames
Vernon for his death.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Because. . .because. . .</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: .. .he was killed, when a gangster named
Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite horse. He took the bullet
himself.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Vernon, over there, was in on the
hit.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: That was good.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He heard everything we were saying.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Come on. Teach. I want you to dance
with me.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I’ve been re-reading Arsonist’s
Daughter. It’s so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It’s like ail your
sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or
wherever, for you to fetch them down.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: And I love the inscription you wrote
to me. Only I’m not quite the downy innocent you think I am.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I hope that isn’t true. We need all the downy
innocents we can get.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: So what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Do?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I just mean, I–I guess Emily isn’t
going to be there when you get home.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Are you holding me up or am I dragging you
down?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Shush.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Look, Hannah. When you get him home …make
sure he’s ail right. Before you leave. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I would if I knew where I was taking
him.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hannah, are you telling me you don’t know
where James Leer lives?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Some apartment somewhere. But I’ve
never seen it.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That strikes me as odd.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: James is odd. I know he has an aunt in
Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but… Come to think of it,
it-wasn’t even his Aunt’s house. He said she worked there. Or something.
I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Mmhmmm.. . . knap …sap….</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: His bag. You know that ratty green
thing he’s always carrying around. He must’ve left it inside.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was…</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: and Q huddle inside.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shit. He must’ve left it back at Thaw. In the
auditorium.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: The one in your office? It’s the best
one .for naps.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t think it really matters, Hannah. We
could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this
point.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ail right. In my office.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Hey. If you want to talk later…I’ll be
up.</p>
<p><strong>vernon hardapple</strong>: You driving this car?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>vernon hardapple</strong>: This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500.
You driving this car?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>vernon hardapple</strong>: Bullshit. It’s mine,
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You must be mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>vernon hardapple</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Go home to your mother, Vernon.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do?
The kid’s practically in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Hit your brakes.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Oh my God! What is that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What’s this guy’s problem?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Just go around him.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Back up. Go out the other way.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: You could always go over him.</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I just had my car jumped on.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Wait here. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Where would we go?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I hope it wasn’t my fault.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: No. I guess you’re here for the
backpack.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh.. .yeah.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: I saw the manuscript inside. So when you
showed up, I figured. . .</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Is it good?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t know. It might be…</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff
true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make
himself, you know, like, last longer?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I
know?</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Well, jeez, you’re reading his biography,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh, right. Yeah, that’s true. He used to rub
ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Sick.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that
your wife?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No, my wife’s out of town.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Her husband.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: What exactly are we doing here, Professor
Tripp?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Taking the long way home.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James I</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m okay. I just lost my balance.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I put you on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I thought you might–l don’t know–
swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Huh? Oh, no. This isn’t Emily’s. I just write
in it.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I guess there’s probably a story behind
that.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: There is, but it’s not that interesting.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Want me to get that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: He didn’t give his name.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: The guy on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived
here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black
interior.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What’d you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be
sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the
right.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I thought maybe you’d won a radio
contest or something. Is that single-spaced?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: That’s a big book you’re writing.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I think it’s sort of writing itself at this
point.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Wow, Hannah always swore you were
working, but–</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: But . . . ?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Nothing, it’s just that,, well, it’s
been awhile since Arsonist’s Daughter, and some people–some of the kids
in workshop–thought maybe you were…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Washed up?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Blocked.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ah. I don’t believe in writer’s block.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Good morning, boys. James.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: If-you ’re planning on staying for breakfast,
I’d put on something a little less comfortable if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Professor Tripp?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: How did I get here last night?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No one seems to know where you live, James.
Hannah thought you’d like my couch.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: And …and before that. Did I do anything?
Anything bad?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the
English Department’s dog and steal his most prized piece of
memorabilia.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Do yourself a favor, James …Hide.</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: Good morning… Professor Tripp? Sorry
to bother you, sir, but I understand you attended an event at Sara and
Walter Gaskell’s house last night and were one of the last to leave…</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: …was just wondering if maybe you saw
anyone. Someone you didn’t know. Who seemed out of place. Suspicious
maybe…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well, there’s always people you don’t know at
these things, but I can’t say there was anybody particularly suspicious.
..Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: A jockey? You mean, like–</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Horses, right. Vernon something… Hardpple</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: Hardapple?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I could be wrong. What happened anyway?</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&amp;E on
Dr. Gaskell’s closet. And the dog’s missing.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: We figure the perpetrator let him
out. He’s blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: The perpetrator.</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: No, the dog.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: One other thing. About this kid,
this student of yours- Leer–James Leer. You wouldn’t know how I could
get in touch with him, would you?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I might have his number on campus.</p>
<p><strong>officer pupcik</strong>: That’s all right. We’ll find
him.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: There you are…</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I thought we were going to talk. Last
night.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh. Well. I…</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: It’s okay. ..I’m here when you want
me.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: Grady, it’s Sara. Thank God you’re
there. You won’t believe what’s happened.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Could you hold on a minute, honey?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: How ’bout we get the hell out of here?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You start her up.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well done, James.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You’re bleeding. Professor Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Where exactly do you live, James?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue
as to the location of your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I got kicked out. Well, not exactly
kicked out. I was asked to leave.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I guess there’s probably a story behind
that.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: There is, but it’s not that
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: So where have you been staying?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: The bus station.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s not -so bad. I know the night
janitor. And there’s a broken locker I can put my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: But James. I mean. ..How long?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: A couple weeks. That’s why… that’s why I
had the gun. For protection.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus, James, you should’ve told someone.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t know… Me.</p>
<p><strong>paperback. grady</strong>: frowns, then detects the true
source of enchantment: a spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Isn’t this…?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You better ease off that stuff, James. It’s
pretty acidic.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I can’t help myself. I don’t know what’s
the matter with me.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shit, James, you’re hungover. What do you
think’s the matter with you?</p>
<p>****: Feeling guilty?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Totally. I’m sorry. A lot was happening this
morning. Can you talk?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Walter’s on campus, being the good soldier for
WordFest. But he’s a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn’s jacket last
night. And Poe’s missing, too.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I-heard.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You heard? How?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Did you confess?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Your fingerprints were all over the
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Really? That was fast.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m kidding. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night.
There is something I need to tell…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Are you limping? Why are you limping?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hub? Oh, well, that’s part of what I need to
. . .</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I
don’t remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don’t
know whether to swoon or smirk.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Really, Sara, I…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I believe you. I believe you want to be with
me. But this is not just about me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I know that. I know what’s at stake here…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No, I don’t think you do. And besides… I
haven’t decided yet.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: About the baby.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: That …and you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m not going to draw the map for you on this
one, Grady. Times like these you have to do your own navigating.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Who’s that sitting in your car?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James Leer.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What’s he doing out there?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m sort of helping him work through some
issues.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Isn’t he lucky.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: She seemed to take it pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yeah, well, actually. . .</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Don’t be proud, James. We’re in Sewickley
Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Your aunt ?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Humboldt County?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s my father. He gets it from his
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Glaucoma?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Colon cancer.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus, James. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>james’ leer</strong>: It’s a bit of a scandal. My parents
live in a small town.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Carvel.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Carvel? Where’s Carvel?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Outside Scranton.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s a hellhole. Three motels and a
mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Your father worked in a mannequin
factory?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Seitz Plastics. That’s where he met my
morn. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she’d been a
dancer.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What kind of dancer? .</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Whatever kind they wanted her to be.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James Leer, are you telling me your mother
was a stripper?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m telling you what I was told by my
uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men’s clubs in Baltimore
before he skipped town on a bad debt.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Didn’t you say your Mom went to Catholic
school?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: When we fall, we fall hard.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Maybe I just needed the moment to
present itself.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: This is so nice. It’s like where Andy
Hardy would live. What’s it called again?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Kinship.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Kinship. And what’s here?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Unless I miss my bet…my wife.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: The one that left you?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s right. That one.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Someone jumped on your car with their
butt ..-</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You can see the outline of a butt.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you
can start on the box.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Maybe she didn’t come here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She came here. We’ll just wait. In the
meantime, I need you to shimmy through.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Relax. Emily hasn’t carried a house key since
she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s not that. It just reminded me of–
you know-of what’s in the car. In the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh. Right. Well, let’s try not to think about
that.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It feels really… good. ..here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I know. It’s the house you want to wake up in
on Christmas morning. Make yourself at home. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>george sanders</strong>: There’s no such thing as a good
influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes, I’ m looking for the Chancellor… I don’t
know. She should be in the main hall …Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: cups a hand over his ear.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sara? Hi. It’s Grady.</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: Where are you, Grady? An elevator?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there’s some
things we need to talk about…</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: You’re in Kinship?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes. But that’s not why I called…</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: With Emily?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What? No’. There’s no one here. I’m just
…just….</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: Just what? Doing a little dusting?</p>
<p><strong>cheerful voices</strong>: Good Morning! Good Morning!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James! For Christ sake, will you turn that
thing down!</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: James? He’s still with you?</p>
<p><strong>judy/mickey</strong>: We talked the whole night through!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Look, Sara. ..I’m not here. ..I’m not here to
. . .</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: Are you there to not reconcile with
her?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No. Sara, you don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: Trust me, I understand. I just want to
say something to you, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yea?</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: How you choose to live your own life
is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James.
He belongs to somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Hullo.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Mom. Dad.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Well, it’s infected, I can tell you that. I’m
just going to clean it up a bit. It’s up to you to-find someone who
knows what they’re doing. Here. Put your foot up.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: So he’s one of your students, this boy?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes. He’s a good kid. Maybe a little messed
up.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Well, I’m sure with the proper guidance he’ll
be fine.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What made you pull out that old thing?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I was thinking of you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: It’s no Arsonist’s Daughter, but I guess you
know that. It’s a young man’s book. It got me remembering how it felt to
be young.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Maybe I should read it.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Oh, I don’t think there’s any danger of you
aging prematurely, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Where’s Emily, Hank?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: I ’don’t know if she’d want me to tell you
that, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m not going to stalk her. Hank. I just.
..want to know where I stand.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Where you stand?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: l-just want to say I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: She’s in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The
neurologist.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Neurologist? Why? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Nothing’s wrong. They went to Wellesley
together.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh. Right. Linda …I haven’t been doing a lot
of sleeping lately. My editor’s in town and I have the book to finish
and–</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Ah, right. The book.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Listen, Hank, I’m sorry about ail this. I
didn’t come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Why did you come here, Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I -just wanted to see her, I guess– Emily.
And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even
though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this-everything that’s
happening-it’s not forever. It doesn’t mean “Goodbye.”</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Give me a break, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: You’re done.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m having a really good time, Professor
Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m really happy for you, James. But do me a
favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff’s not for amateurs.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I just wanted a little sip.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James,
exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Probably about the time you gave me the
codeine pills last night.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus… Look, James, you appear to
possess-like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a rather
ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I
’think it’s best if, for the moment at least …we abstain.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You’re mad at me, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You’re mad because I shot your
girlfriend’s dog.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It wasn’t her dog. It’s her husband’s– Who
said anything about girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Okay, James, I wish you hadn’t shot my
girlfriend’s dog. Even though Poe and I weren’t exactly what you’d call
simpatico, that’s no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the
fact remains that I’m the one who took you up into the Chancellor’s
bedroom. I’m the one who has to take the blame. I- don’t know what the
hell I was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Sure you do. You were thinking: ‘That’s
no cap gun in that kid’s overcoat.’ You were thinking ‘I can’t let that
kid get on. the bus alone-he might never get on the bus again.’ You were
thinking: ‘I’ve got to find a way to distract this kid.’ So you did. It
was–in its way–a noble act.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Thanks for the halo, James, but I’ve . never
done that much thinking ahead in my” life-ever.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: So, why did you take me up there?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I -don’ t know, James . I don’ t know why I
do half the things I do. Who does? Why do you wear that coat?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James, fall semester, first day of class, it
was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s why they all give you such a hard time
in workshop.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Because of my coat?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Because you act like a goddamn spook all the
time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of
you.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Jealous? Of me?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Not you. Your talent.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: The hell I am.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it.
You said so yourself.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I never said that.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Yes you did. Last night. To your friend
Crabtree. “Is he any good?” he said. And you said: “Not yet he isn’t.” I
heard you myself.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I didn’t mean it that way.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie,
Howard, the others–they ’re right. My stories are annoying. They go on
and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become,
until finally you just want to grab something heavy and–</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shut up, James. You’re annoying. Carrie and
Howard don’t know what the fuck they’re talking about, okay? The entire
class combined- including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one tenth of
one percent the talent you have, okay?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: But, last night…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I
was drunk, I was stoned. I’d been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me.
How ’bout cutting me some slack?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: And don’t be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares
what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a good writer? You want to
be-a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most
of them haven’t thought in .years.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books
don’t mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Arsonist’s Daughter meant something.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I mean it. It means something to me.
It’s one of the reasons I came to school here. To be in your class. To
be taught by you. It’s one of the reasons I wanted to become a
writer.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: In a minute. Get us a table.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: C-a-r-v-e-I. That’s right, Carvel. Yes, I’m
sure. It’s outside Scranton.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You have no listing. Okay, well, lady– at
this very moment, as we speak, I’m looking of a resident of Carvel,
Pennsylvania. I think he’d be pretty interested to learn that the good
people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his entire hometown. It’s not
like I’m making this up as I go along–</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Want a bite?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: That’s why you’re having them. Your
spells.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like
we’re in a Tennessee Williams play. I don’t have spells.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: What would you call them then?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t know. …‘Episodes.’</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s because you don’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I eat.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: When nobody’s looking.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I just worry about you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You just worry about yourself, James.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Nowhere. You just sit here and… eat.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Professor Tripp?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Grady.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Looks like I’ve dashed a-wonderful
evening.</p>
<p><strong>fred leer</strong>: Hardly.</p>
<p><strong>amanda leer</strong>: We were on our way to a benefit. But,
as luck would have it, the club was on the way, so… We were able to put
in an appearance.</p>
<p><strong>fred leer</strong>: Otherwise we would’ve been here
earlier.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ah. Well, that’s ail right. James and I ’had
a little dinner.</p>
<p><strong>fred leer</strong>: Well, certainly we’ll reimburse you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That’s not necessary. I just felt. ..it might
be good for James to be with his family this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>fred leer</strong>: Well, of course, we can understand
that.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well. Let me go get him.</p>
<p><strong>amanda leer</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m not going with them..</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James. Listen. Things-things are a little
weird with me right now and I– well–I have enough blame to shoulder
these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to
you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to
happen, trust me. That’s why I need you to go home. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m not going, with them.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James, like it or not, they’re your
parents.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Parents? They’re not my parents. They’re
my grandparents. My parents are dead.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I swear. My father had his own airplane
he used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and my mom were flying up
to our house in the Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in the
newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I ’swear. My father was a senior vice
president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite. Her maiden name was
Guggenheim.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I remember that. Five or six years ago.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Six. Their plane went down right outside
Scranton.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Near Carvel?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m sorry about all that. I just-I don’t
like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: James, come on. That man is obviously your
father. You look just like him.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: There’s a reason for that.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: That’s why she hates me. That’s why she
makes me sleep in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: In the crawl space, with the rats and the
casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I swear.</p>
<p><strong>fred leer</strong>: Thank you. Professor Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>amanda leer</strong>: Oh, don’t worry. We’ll take care of
him. You can be sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>grady’s pov - rear window</strong>: as the Mercedes begins to
pull away and James turns, elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack.
Spying Grady, he raises one limp hand, and then-as if it were held by a
string-lets it drop.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Crabtree.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Grady!</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I know I shouldn’t have, but there it
was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn’t resist and-and–I suck.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No, it’s okay. I just can’t believe I left it
out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn’t been in here, has he? Poking
around?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I don’t know–maybe- I don’t think
so.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Listen, Hannah. You don’t remember where that
aunt worked, do you? James’ aunt.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: He shot the Chancellor’s dog, didn’t
he? The blind one.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Actually, He’s not the Chancellor’
s–What?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: At first the police thought he just
ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the
carpet -</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: CRABTREE said it sounded like
something James would be messed up in.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Crabtree? He doesn’t even know James.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Who does?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Trip?! Where are you’</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James
that day?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I told you, Sewickly Heights.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: But where? I need the street.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I don’t know, Grady. I just dropped
him on a corner.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Trip?!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: No! Don’t go. I’ve been waiting ail
night for you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Listen, Hannah, I’m flattered, really, but
right now I–</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Tripp, where the hell. . .</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You stay there.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: What? Ohhhh. Is that… it?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I
would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Gee, I don’t know. Crabs. I don’t seem to
remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to
trash my living room.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Sometimes we have to improvise.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I
mean, besides you and. ..me?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: James? My James? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Nothing, he’s just been sort of, I don’t
know.. .kidnapped.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Kidnapped? By who?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: His parents.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Good God. Let’s go rescue him.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don’t
know where they live.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Ah. Wait a minute. The university must
know where he lives.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s a little late to call Admissions.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Is it a little late to call the
Chancellor?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Maybe …I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: You know–based on what I’ve read– this is
a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Love. It’s Love facade–and what do you mean
‘based on what you’ve read’? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an
hour while gargling methamphetamines.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I’ve been doing this a long time, Tripp. I
feel this kid in my bones.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Only in your bones?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: No. I think I might be right. I’ve felt it
before…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: How bad is it for you?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Bad enough. And God knows I don’t exactly
fit the new corporate profile.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Competence.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: What’s to tell?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Plenty, I’m sure. But, for what it’s
worth…</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: …I like her.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on
. that thing. How are we-supposed to find his?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I told you. They keep him chained in the
basement. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>woman singing</strong>: Why should I care though he gave me
the air? Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why? And wonder
why?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Doris Day.</p>
<p><strong>grady/crabtree</strong>: James Leer.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Hey. What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: We’re springing you. Leer. Get some pants
on.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I can’t believe you made fun of my robe.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I like what you’ve done with it. When’s
Captain Nemo moving in?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: The candelabras were my Gran’s.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh, Christ, don’t start on ol’ Gran or we’ll
leave you here.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Hey, I heard all about it–the parents, the
grandparents, the China town thing– and I believe you, okay? That’s why
we’re here. Now go get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Can I–I mean–do you mind–if I wear this
again. Professor Tripp?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ah, wear whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: So modest.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: So sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some
slack.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s just ail that crap he spins out. Just
once I’d like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: The-truth. I know that’s always been real
important to you. Key, check this out…</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock
to: see him, shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter.
Limping. Beaten.’ Sound like anyone we know? But it was later, when the
great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight… Bitter glow of
twilight? This kid definitely needs an editor. …and muttered simply, “It
means nothing. All of it. Nothing,” that the true shock came. It was
then that the boy understood that his hero’s true injuries lay hidden in
a darker place. His heart…’</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes? ‘His heart…’</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: ‘His heart, once capable of inspiring
others so completely, could no longer inspire so much as itself. It beat
now only out of habit. It beat now only because it could.’</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m ready…</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You all right, Professor Tripp?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He’s great. Come on, let’s blow before ol’
Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Oh, well, that’s just it. She’s been
coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If
I’m not here, she might …call the police or.. .something.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple
pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won’t know
the difference.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only
they use a couple big hams.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’ve got something better than a teddy
bear.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: POE – as he’s lowered delicately onto James’
bed.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sweet dreams, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Things must’ve picked up after we
left.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Crabtree.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Ye-es?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: How are you–is it Joe?</p>
<p><strong>goatee kid</strong>: Jeff. Sorry. I didn’t even know this was
your house until about an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Don’t sweat it. Well. ’Night, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>goatee kid</strong>: Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last
semester, what I said that time in office hours-I hope there’s no hard
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>goatee kid</strong>: I mean, I was breaking up with this girl
at the time and my car was ail fucked up and– well–I was pretty bent in
general.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s cool, Jeff. Really.</p>
<p><strong>goatee kid</strong>: I just want you to know that’s why I
dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing
my money and you being a pseudo-Faulknerian nobody.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hello? Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s Grady, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: GRADY Tripp. English Department.</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: I know it’s you, Grady, I just…
Christ, Grady, do you know what time it -is?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I have …eight-fifteen. That’s not right, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: It’s three-thirty, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: This is important.</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: What is it, Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m in love with your wife.</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sara. I’m in love with her.</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Are you drinking. Professor Tripp?
Right now.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Nevertheless, I’d like to see you in
my office Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sara.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I tried to call, but apparently there’s
something wrong…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It seems one of our students is - missing and
his parents found a dead dog in his bed.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m sorry, Sara. I’ve been trying to tell
you. It’s all my-</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m not very happy with you right now, Grady.
But more importantly, Walter’s not very happy and he’s gotten the police
involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all
of this. You wouldn’t happen to know where James is, would you,
Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Inside.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: And the jacket?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Over there. In the backseat of the…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it
right there last night.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Are you sure you parked it there?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Of course, I’m sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty
police are back.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’ll deal with this. You dig up James.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Is he awake?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I’m afraid he’s pretty worn out, poor
kid.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Nevertheless. There’s a police officer
standing on the porch and I don’t think he’s going away.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: That same guy?</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: You snore.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: So I hear.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: No offense, Professor Tripp, but you
look sorta crappy.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: He’s right, you look horrible.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Thank you, Frankie and Annette.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: It’s the Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Ah, right. Well, I gave you my
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: And we both thank you for that, but we’re…
we’re… fine.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m fine, right. Fit as a fucking
fiddle.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Shut up, James.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: So what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: There is no problem. Did I say there was a
problem?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: How’s it coming back there, Professor
Tripp?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Who do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: The Chancellor’s here? Now?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Evidently. Coming!</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Does she mean–does she know about …her
dog?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s Walter’s dog and yes, she does. Know.
But let’s spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the
hail.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: James. This book of yours. It’s not bad.
Not bad at all.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I want to publish this. I’ve got to. I
think they’ll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be
brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out
there he can be the next Jean Genet. It’s been awhile since somebody
wrote a good book in jail.</p>
<p><strong>pupcik</strong>: As I told the Chancellor, Professor, I’m.
just going to run James here over to the university. It’ll be up to
Dr. Gaskell where we go from there.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Don’t worry, James, I’ll figure something
out.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: I’m not worried. You’re not worried, are
you. Professor Tripp?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m a little worried, James.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Don’t be. I don’t care if they expel me.
I probably should be expelled.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well, let’s see if we can keep that from
happening.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Professor Tripp…?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yes, James.</p>
<p><strong>james leer</strong>: Even if I end up going to jail….</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: This is not what the university has in mind
when it promises a liberal education, Grady.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Would Walter really press charges?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s within the realm. He takes his souvenirs
pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I think I might have.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: And what do you think you might have said?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I think I might’ve said I was in love with
you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: He told me.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: And what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I said it didn’t sound like you.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: So- what do we do now? ,</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Find the jacket.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Oh’ huh. Exactly how do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her
car.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: It seems to me that girl would let you
borrow her pancreas.</p>
<p><strong>goatee kid</strong>: I’m telling you, the tango is ail about
latent homosexual love. Look at the way they dance– it’s sodomy.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Grady. Hi. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>goatee kid</strong>: I’ll be …somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hey, Jeff. If you’re really interested in
discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the
hall.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He cribbed that from Borges.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: It beats ‘What’s your major?’</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could
borrow your car. Mine’s sort of out of commission.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: Sure. The keys are on the dresser next
to. ..to your book.</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: I uh, I didn’t finish, I …fell
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That good, hub?</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: No, it’s not that, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>hannah green</strong>: It’s just that, you know, I was
thinking about how, in class, you’re always telling us ’-that writers
make choices–at least the good ones. And, don’t get me wrong. I’m not
saying the book isn’t really great-I mean, really great- but at times
it’s, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone’s
horses and ail the dental records and so on-and I don’t know, maybe I’m
wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like… …you
didn’t make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be
different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren’t always …under the
influence.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as
shocking as this may sound, I’m not the first writer to sip a little
weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I
wrote, as you say, ‘under the influence,’ happened to win a little
something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted ‘under the
influence.’</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Want some help with that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Don’t touch it.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan
owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Only now I’m starting to think the car wasn’t
exactly Jerry’s to give.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: So whose car is it?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: My guess-Vernon Hardapple.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: The hood jumper?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He said a few things that lead me to believe
the car’s his.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Such as.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: ‘That’s my car, motherfucker.’</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the
car. We find the car…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: …we find the jacket.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: There’s only one problem, Tripp. We don’t
know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy
up.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No wonder he screwed us over.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Christ, Tripp. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Call it a hunch.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I’d call it genius.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s good to know I’m still talented at
something. Keep the motor running.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>marilyn</strong>: I know you. . .</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oola.</p>
<p><strong>oola</strong>: I never forget a drink.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I never forget an Oola.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Forget me?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Vernon.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Move away, cupcake. He’s got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Who’s got a gun?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: You’ve got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Relax, Vernon…</p>
<p><strong>oola</strong>: Why’s he calling you Vernon?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Why’s he sitting in my car? He’s crazy,
that’s why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Not true. You’re the only Vernon I know.
Actually, I’m wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Shut up. Cupcake. Please. Inside.</p>
<p><strong>oola</strong>: You’ re not going to shoot him, are you?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: I’m going to shoot him. If he doesn’t put
that gun down.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It’s just a souvenir. They don’t even make
the caps anymore.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And
that’s a gun.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No, really….</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Are you crazy!</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: You all right, cupcake?</p>
<p><strong>oola</strong>: Who’s Vernon?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Tripp! Run!</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Who the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon
girl’s clutch.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Woah.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No! Don’t shoot! He’s just a lousy
driver.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Oh… my… God!</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Naturally you have copies.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I have an alternate version of the first
chapter.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: You’ll be all right then. Look at Carlyle,
when he lost his luggage.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: That was MacCaulay.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those
stories.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: He was never able to reproduce them.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don’t want to
depreciate the loss here, but perhaps–in a sense- this– is for the
best.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Kind of a sign, you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: In a sense.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t think so. In my experience, signs are
usually a lot more subtle.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Let me get this straight. All that paper
that went into the river. That was the only copy?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: ’Fraid so.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: And you’re saying it’s some kind of sign?
What the fuck’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I’m just saying that sometimes,
subconsciously, a person will put themselves in a situation-perhaps even
create that situation- in order to have an arena in which to work out an
unresolved issue. It’s a covert way, if you will, of addressing a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: I’ll tell you the problem. You behind the
wheel. There’s your fucking problem.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: That’s pretty simplistic, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Hey, pal, you don’t start doing crazy eights
in the middle of the street none of this happens.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a
gun to his head?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: He was trying to steal my car!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ail right, all right It’s done. There’s no
need to talk about it. It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>oola</strong>: So what was it about? Your book. What was the
story?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: What he means is, it’s difficult to
distill the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in the mind.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Yeah, but you gotta know what it’s about,
right? I mean, if you didn’t know what it was about, why were you
writing it?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I couldn’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Boy or girl?</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: As long as it looks like her, I don’t care.
You know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: No sweat. Only do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Stop calling me Vernon.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.</p>
<p><strong>oola</strong>: Yea?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had
small shoulders, like you. Most people don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Man, that book of yours must’ve been one
nutty motherfucking ride.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: You mind explaining what you just did?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Came to my senses. CRABTREE</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Walter Gaskell isn’t going to send James Leer
to jail, Crabs. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Do you know he won’t expel him?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No. But I don’t think that matters.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: That’s very enlightened, Professor. It’s
comforting to know that America’s children have you for a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell
them what you know. You tell them to find their voice and stick with it,
because that’s all you have in the end. You tell the ones who have it to
keep at it and you tell the ones who don’t to keep at it, too. Because
that’s the only way to get where you’re going. Of course, it helps if
you know where you want to go. Maybe that’s the only thing–that and
Sara– that’s made the last seven years worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Me? What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Gee, I don’t know, Crabs… Improvise. You’re
good at that.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I’m sorry, Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You peeked, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: I peeked.</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: It really had the makings, Tripp. There
was a lot to admire. I’ve …never read anything quite like it.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: You’re not just trying to make me feel
better?</p>
<p><strong>crabtree</strong>: Scout’s honor.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well, thanks for that, Crabs.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sara!</p>
<p><strong>q</strong>: Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look at
Arsonist’s Daughter the other night. There’s a description of a bald
cypress that left’ me breathless.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank
teller’s breasts in your last one.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voics</strong>: Hey, Professor Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>carrie mcwhirty</strong>: If you’re looking for Hannah, she’s
on the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>carrie mcwhirty</strong>: Who’s that guy she’s with? Didn’t
he used to be in workshop?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango
dancers.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: And now, as those of you who’ve been with us
in previous years know, we have a tradition of sorts here at WordFest.
I’m speaking, of course, of The Plums.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North
Braddock, found a publisher for her children’s book. The Loneliest
Prawn, Susan, stand up.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: And Robert Wilkenson–who many of you know
for his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette–has found a home with
Putnam for his new Three Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Now, this next one, I think, is especially
exciting to announce, because it concerns a student here at the
university. Our own James Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has
found a publisher for his first novel, which I believe is called The
Lovely Parade.</p>
<p><strong>carrie mcwhirty</strong>: I have a class with him.</p>
<p><strong>carrie mcwhirty</strong>: The guy’s kind of an alien probe,
if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Take a bow, James!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: And finally–and perhaps not least
importantly–Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has also decided to publish my
own book–a critical exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and Joe
DiMaggio and its function in American mythopoetics-which, tentatively,
I’ve entitled The Last American Marriage. ”</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Until next year. Thank you, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Sara!</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Yo, Traxler.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Hey, Professor Tripp.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Do you get high, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Only when I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Holy shit. Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: As a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>traxler</strong>: Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful
^here…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I passed out.</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’ve been doing that a lot lately.</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: So I hear. You’ve also been smoking a lot
of marijuana, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Do you think that’s why I’ve been having
these… … spells?</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: How long have you been having them?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: The last month maybe.</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: How long have you been smoking
marijuana?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I
believe.</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: That’s probably not the problem, then.
What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’ve been trying to finish a book…</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: And your wife left you.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Is that in my chart?</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: I spoke with the woman who saved your
life. You’re lucky she came along when she did.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An
internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist,
as well.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: She told you about. . .</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: Her dog, yes.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Actually, it was her husband’s dog…</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem,
all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is
severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you’ll be fine, but
another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells.
I’m guessing they’re a result of the anxiety you’ve been experiencing
lately.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: They’re anxiety attacks? That’s a little
disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: Better luck next time.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: So is my friend…is Sara still here?</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: No. There’s no one here.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I have to see her. As soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>greenhut</strong>: Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to
leave, I can’t stop you. But I’m going to write you a prescription for a
course of ampicillin and I want you to follow it to the end-no matter
how stupid you decide to be with everything else. All right?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I wonder if you could show me something.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Are these the only ones you have?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Is that a suggestion?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m so glad to see you, Sara.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you
out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I’m through improvising.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true?
Did you lose it all?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I lost it ail.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Oh, Grady. You’re such a putz.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: And you’re old.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Ouch. How many?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Dozens. It’s very sad.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I went and looked at-some babies just
now.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: I guess you have to go on faith.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Some times…</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Did you tell Walter?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I told Walter.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Does he still love you?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It didn’t come up.</p>
<p><strong>grady</strong>: Well I do. I’ve always loved you, Sara. I
didn’t know it at the time, but I’d always been waiting for you. My
whole life. Because you’re who I need. Because nothing makes sense
