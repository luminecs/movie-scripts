<h1 id="the-grudge">the-grudge</h1>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Hey. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Peter? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>on the pavement</strong>: a line of blood appears, moving
down the center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Karen!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll never get used to this.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Maybe we should find a different train
station.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: A public display of affection is considered
rude in Japan.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We walk past this temple every day, Karen
–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah, but I’ve never seen this before.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s a Buddhist ritual. The incense smoke
carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors, to help them remain
at peace.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s amazing. You’re like this infinite
storehouse of wisdom. Or trivia. I’m not sure which.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s not trivia. It’s what they believe. And
it’s far better, by the way, than your little pollution ritual.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Nothing. I just – I like that about you. You
seem to be able to remember everything that’s really important.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Except the time.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, crap –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: C’mon, you’re gonna be late.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck. And I might
have a vested interest in those years.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Will I see you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll call you when I get home.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Fourteen. I hate odd numbers.</p>
<p><strong>int. nursing care center - day</strong>: Through the front
doors, we see Doug kiss Karen again. They finally separate, and Doug
walks off.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Karen!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Are you free this afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I just came by to pick up some books I left
here. I’m not scheduled to work today –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I know. But are you free? Do you have
class?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Just a test to study for. Why?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Your wish has been granted.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s Yoko’s case, but she didn’t show up for
work this morning, and I can’t reach her at home. She must be sick, or
something. And she has the damn house key.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What’s this phrase?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: “Mild dementia with severe lethargy.”
Apparently she sleeps through most of the day. Her daughter-in-law
doesn’t work, so she’ll probably be there.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: You’re the one who’s been bugging me about
getting out there on your own. Besides, it’s an English-only house.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Here’s the address. Use the wall chart if you
need help – and don’t forget to bring a map.</p>
<p><strong>the wall chart</strong>: a color-coded diagram shows how the
long address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture, City,
Ward, District, Block, Sub-Block and House Number.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Don’t worry Karen, you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shopping district - day</strong>: Karen walks down the
populated sidewalk, weaving through STREET VENDORS, and passing a large
GROCERY STORE.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello? Mrs. Williams?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is anyone here?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - living room - day</strong>: Karen stands in
the doorway, surveying the room. The place is in a complete state of
disarray.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: at the far end of the room, a FROSTED-GLASS
PANELED DOOR leads to an adjacent room.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh my God… are you alright? –</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - porch - day</strong>: Emma sits on the back
porch, staring vacantly. But her expression isn’t simply blank - there’s
an odd sadness there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay, Emma. Let’s try again: my name is
Karen. Do you remember? I’m from the Health Center. I’m substituting for
Yoko, just for today.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Looks like you need a new Band-Aid. How’d
this happen, Emma? Would you like a bath? Maybe that will help you feel
better.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - bathroom - day</strong>: Karen turns on the
water, puts the stopper over the drain.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s okay, Emma.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - porch - day</strong>: Karen uses a sponge to
bathe Emma, her robe rolled to her waist. Emma stares absently at the
sky.</p>
<p><strong>on the photo</strong>: a grinning JAPANESE BOY holds a cute
BLACK CAT. His MOTHER and FATHER stand beside him. They’re all beaming
at the camera – a perfect, happy family.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Nice one, Karen.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - entrance - dusk</strong>: Karen steps into
the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. She looks up at A RAILING overhead.
Some trash is visible sticking over the edge. Karen shakes her head:</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How did you get up there?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - second floor hallway - dusk</strong>: Karen
steps into the hallway and listens. There it is again, and this time
there’s no doubt –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - front room - dusk</strong>: The sounds
immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER BEDROOM. It’s dark, thick
blinds covering the windows. A frosted window, overlooking the foyer,
isn’t helping much.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - kitchen - night</strong>: Karen is on her
cell phone:</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes, he was shut in a closet! There was tape
around the – No, they’re not home yet. I don’t know, Emma hasn’t said a
word to me – He’s still upstairs – yes, I’m sure he’s Japanese – But –
Yes, alright, Alex. Just please get here as soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My name is Karen. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Toshio.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - living room - night</strong>: Karen enters
the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the voices of a happy couple
on the GREETING :</p>
<p><strong>matthew &amp; jennifer</strong>: “Konnichiwa! Matt and
Jennifer aren’t around, leave a message.”</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: “Hey, guys, it’s Susan. Matt, are you there?
Pick up…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: “I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay.
Yesterday was… a bit weird, and – I’m just a little worried.”</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: “Listen, just give me a call when you can,
okay?”</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: …I’ve told them over and over… I’ve told them
over and over…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Emma, who were you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I just want her to leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You should get some rest, Emma.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - front room - night</strong>: MATTHEW and his
wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly, she doesn’t. She’s staring
at the ceiling, listening to –</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - entrance - morning</strong>: 25 25</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You’re up?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Mmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: Emma is asleep on her mattress.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I wonder if Mom’s okay. She’s been sleeping
ever since we got here.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Not at night.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I told you, Matthew, you can sleep through
anything.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m sorry, sweetheart. It was probably just
the move – I’m sure she’ll get back on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You seen my travel mug?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I didn’t unpack it yet.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Maybe you should say something to the
helper, what’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yoko.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Who knows? Maybe there’s something she can
suggest.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I miss seeing this every morning.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hey, kiddo. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I went for a walk yesterday. Just to
explore. I got lost and couldn’t find anyone who could speak English,
who could help me. I felt so… stupid.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: This will get easier soon, for Mom, for all
of us. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Or else?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Or else I’ll tell the company it’s just not
working out, and that we’re going back to the States with or without my
old job. They can get someone else to crunch their numbers.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: But until then – promise me you’ll give it
a good try, okay Jen?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Is this Yoko’s bike?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: It’s been here all night.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’ll probably be home late, maybe around
nine or so.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I knew you’d forget.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Dinner, your sister? At seven?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Oh yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You were going to cook.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I have a big conference. They usually run
long.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’ll do the shopping. Just call me if
you’re going to be late.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: before her is a WALL OF JAPANESE PRODUCTS.
Barely a lick of English on any of the brightly-colored packages.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - living room - day</strong>: CLOSE ON the
same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now open with a spoon sticking
out of it. Resting, with a glass of water, atop the kotatsu table.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: If you need something, all you have to do
is say so –</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Who’s – who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - second floor hallway - day</strong>:
Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar BOY running
into the FRONT ROOM.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Sorry I’m late, it took awhile to wrap
things up.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Jen? Susan?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - living room - night</strong>: Matthew turns
on the lights. The room has reverted to its messy state, even worse than
before.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: What the hell? –</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Mom? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Where’s Jennifer, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Did Yoko come today, Mom? Remember? The
pretty girl?</p>
<p><strong>over the railing</strong>: Matthew re-enters the foyer,
looking up.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Jen? Are you up there?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Jennifer? What is it –</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: What’s wrong? What happened???</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’ll… I’ll call an ambulance…</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - kitchen - night</strong>: Matthew runs into
the kitchen grabbing A LARGE BOOK on one of the moving boxes. The
Japanese equivalent of a YELLOW PAGES.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: `Ambulance’… “kyukyusha”.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Who are you? What – what are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - entrance - night</strong>: The DOORBELL
rings. Then a few more times.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You guys in the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - kitchen - night</strong>: Susan walks in,
puts the wine on the table. Looks around.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I thought you guys were gonna cook!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hi, Mom. How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I guess I came at a bad time, huh?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’ll give you guys one minute to finish
whatever you’re doing up there and get your butts down here.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I mean it, guys.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, I warned you. Prepare to be emotionally
scarred.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Matthew! Don’t scare me like that!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What’s going on? Where’s Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: She went out. Something came up.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I hope she’s not long. I’m absolutely
starving.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I knew it. You guys forgot to go shopping,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m sorry. This is a bad time.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Are you okay? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You should go.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Did something happen? What’s –</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: She doesn’t love me… she never loved
me…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Stop it, Matthew.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Matthew, please –</p>
<p><strong>on matthew</strong>: he stands there, head tilted down, for a
moment. Then he straightens. Slowly closes the front door.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - day</strong>: It’s an overcast afternoon.
Swollen clouds hang low over The House. It looks a bit more imposing
than usual.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This is Suzuki-san, he’s the Real Estate
broker.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He said: “welcome to Tokyo”. And that you
must be very important to your company for them to rent this place for
you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Even in our own house?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Even in your own house.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - living room - day</strong>: Suzuki opens the
blinds, letting some light into the place. It’s not helping much – it’s
still pretty dreary.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Isn’t the layout great? Wait `till you see
the back room. It’s perfect for Mom – she won’t have to deal with the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Her bed won’t be here until next week, but
we can put the mattress on the floor. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He says no one has lived in this house for
three years.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>suzuki</strong>: Ex-pen-sive.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Where’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - second floor hallway - day</strong>: Susan
comes up the stairs, worried.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mom? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Did you get her?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Take a pill, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: C’mon, Mom. You know what the doctor said
about stairs.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: She okay?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mom? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - hallway - day</strong>: Suzuki walks from
the kitchen into the hallway, giving the place one final look-over.</p>
<p><strong>the bathtub</strong>: Filled to the brim. Still and silent.
Not so much as a ripple on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: It’s perfect. We’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>matthew &amp; jennifer</strong>: “Konnichiwa! Matt and
Jennifer aren’t around, leave a message.”</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hey, guys, it’s Susan. Matt, are you there?
Pick up… Okay, well, I’m leaving work now so you can try my cell, or
just call me at home later.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay.
Yesterday was…</p>
<p><strong>int. stairwell - 10th floor - night</strong>: The hallway is
chilly – Susan shivers. She’s about to start walking down when she looks
up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the top floor FLICKERING.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Is anybody there?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: In the stairs… there was… something… a
strange person… all the lights were going out…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’ll take a look. Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>omitted</strong>: 54aa 54aa</p>
<p><strong>on the screen</strong>: – the GUARD continues down the 10TH
FLOOR HALL, stopping at the door to the stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>on the screen</strong>: the Guard opens the stairwell door
and leans inside, checking it out.</p>
<p><strong>on susan</strong>: her eyes are glued to the screen.
Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>on the screen</strong>: the Guard, finding nothing out of the
ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>on the screen</strong>: the stairwell door OPENS AGAIN. And
then –</p>
<p><strong>on susan</strong>: she recoils from the screen in horror,
unable to tear her gaze away. Her mouth opens in a silent scream, her
eyes widening as she watches –</p>
<p><strong>int. office building - foyer - night</strong>: Susan bursts
out of the security room and runs through the empty lobby, towards the
front doors.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Matthew! Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m downstairs. What number are you
again?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: 702. I’ll buzz you in.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: Matthew’s face, distorted by the fish-eye
glass. He’s looking into the peephole, with a sneer on his face.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t know what you’re up to, but this is
not cool –</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: the phone lies broken in the middle of the
floor. Otherwise, the hallway is empty.</p>
<p><strong>int. susan’s apartment - night</strong>: – slowly walks into
THE KITCHEN. She reaches out and turns the faucet handle. Tightens it.
The dripping stops.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please… stop it…</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - kitchen - night</strong>: Karen’s CELL PHONE
lays on the table in the foreground. Beyond is the hallway, and the
front door.</p>
<p><strong>the back room</strong>: Alex is visible through the sliding
door leading to the back porch. He peers inside.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: A FIGURE covered head-to-toe in a white
sheet lies on the mattress. Unmoving.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Karen?</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: I can handle this myself, you know. It’s
just a routine call. I don’t know why you wanted to come.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - later</strong>: The house feels completely
different: all the interior lights are on, a few POLICE OFFICERS mill
about, two EMTs wheel EMMA’S BODY out the front door on a gurney.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: I am Detective Nakagawa. This is Detective
Igarashi, my assistant.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Is Karen okay?</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: She is very shaken. We would like her to
stay in the hospital tonight, under evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Do you know these people?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Matthew Williams, and his wife Jennifer. He’s
Emma’s son, the woman Karen came here to see.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I met them when they came to register. It’s
standard procedure, though the visits were arranged by his employer. He
works at –</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: We’ve spoken with his employer. He did not
show up for work today.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: If you could please come by tomorrow to
make a statement, the address is there, at the bottom –</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yoko.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Karen was a substitute – Yoko is the girl who
is normally in charge of Emma. She’s also been missing from work.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: For the last two days.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I think I saw her bike outside.</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: That’s Matthew’s sister.</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: This must be her.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Call her at work, then at home. If no one
answers, send someone to –</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - entrance - night</strong>: Nakagawa and
Igarashi enter from the hallway, followed by their men. They look up to
the second floor.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: the ATTIC PANEL yawns wide open.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: I need your flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: God!</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: What the hell… what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - night</strong>: The POLICE CARS outside have
attracted a small crowd. The TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE
VAN.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Who does this belong to?</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: We don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: I can use the blood to help identify the
person.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Is it possible that someone could live
without… that?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: I certainly hope not.</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: Someone just reported another death. It’s
not in our district… but I think we should check it out.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: The cause of death is not clear… but it is
the man who sold them this house.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tokyo street - day</strong>: CLOSE ON the spinning
wheels of a bicycle. A familiar one.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - entrance - day</strong>: Yoko steps inside.
She instinctively slips off her shoes. She calls out, in decent
English:</p>
<p><strong>yoko</strong>: Hi, excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>yoko</strong>: Emma? It’s Yoko. I’m coming in.</p>
<p><strong>yoko</strong>: Hi, Emma. It’s good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>yoko</strong>: My name is Yoko.</p>
<p><strong>yoko</strong>: You should be in bed –</p>
<p><strong>yoko</strong>: You shouldn’t be playing with this!</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - second floor hallway - day</strong>: – the
hallway is COMPLETELY DARK. An unnatural blackness. The skylights above,
which were previously filled with sunlight, are now completely
opaque.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: the murky blackness of the hall seems to be
slowly CREEPING IN, phantomlike, around the edges of the door.</p>
<p><strong>– the doorway</strong>: the creeping darkness is now coming
in around all sides, not just the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>int. attic - day</strong>: Yoko’s head appears. Then her
shoulders. She looks around, but can’t see a thing in the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>another pov</strong>: we’re at the far end of the attic,
suddenly and rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO…</p>
<p><strong>on yoko</strong>: something brushes her face. Long, black
hair.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s okay. I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Your boss told me what happened. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I talked to your teachers. They said you can
take as much time as you need. We could go to Kyoto for a weekend, see
those temples you’re always talking about.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Running away won’t help.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There’s nothing to run away from, Kat. No one
blames you for what happened.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m not even sure what did happen.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You went to help someone who was, quite
simply, beyond help.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No, that’s not what I mean…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That house. There was something…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t beat yourself up searching for a greater
truth, Kat. An old woman passed away in her sleep. It’s sad, but that’s
all it is –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Is that how they said she died?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in
a way, it will help you later. Death is an unfortunate but integral part
of your future career. There’s no avoiding it. Maybe now you’ll be more…
ready for it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t think I’ll ever be ready for
something like that.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb you, Miss Davies. I
was wondering if you could answer some additional questions?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m Doug. Karen’s boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You up for this?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why don’t you find out when I can check out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay. Tired.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: You are an exchange student? And you have
been volunteering at the Health Center for…?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Three months. I needed a social welfare
credit.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: You said this was the first time you’d
been in that house?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: About the Japanese boy you said you saw
there –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: No, not yet. You said the boy had been
taped into the closet?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes, that’s right. He was… holding a cat. A
black cat. There was a book in the closet, too. I think it was a
journal.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Did it belong to the boy?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I don’t think so. I think it belonged to a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The writing. It looked feminine.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I left it on the kitchen table.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: I didn’t see any book on the table.
Perhaps someone moved it. Did you speak with the boy after you opened
the closet?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I asked him his name. He said `Toshio’.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: One more question, please.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: We found this in the room where…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This is him. This is the boy.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Are you certain?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes. Positive.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Detective Nakagawa?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The whole time I was in that house, I felt
something was… wrong.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What happened there?</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: The bodies of the son and daughter- in-law
of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: It seems that the son killed his wife, and
then himself –</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Please excuse me for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospial - hallway - night</strong>: IN THE HALLWAY: the
men speak with hushed voices.</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: We checked the apartment of Susan, the
sister. She wasn’t there…</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: The chain lock had been drawn from the
inside. And the deadbolt. But we found no one in the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Get the surveillance tapes from the office
building.</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: They were the first family to live in that
house since the incident three years ago –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Toshio…</p>
<p><strong>int. nursing care center - night</strong>: The place is
quiet, completely deserted. Except for –</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: a trail of FOOTPRINTS lead from the pool of
liquid, around the base of the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yoko?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What… What happened, Yoko?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Say something, please…</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: everything goes blurry, and canted 90
degrees. But it looks like there’s A FIGURE standing in the hallway,
watching the scene…</p>
<p><strong>on alex</strong>: eyes wide, he opens his mouth to scream
–</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>omitted</strong>: 97 97</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Have you determined a cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Not yet. The blood on his body – isn’t his.
It belongs to her.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: I don’t understand. He killed Yoko, before
he died?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: The jawbone you found in the attic
yesterday with the American couple belongs to this girl. I estimate it
was – removed – from her body two or three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>igarashi</strong>: But I thought you said her body was found
with this man, tonight.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: Then how did she get from the house to the
Health Center?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: She survived for two days without
this?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: It would seem so.</p>
<p><strong>nakagawa</strong>: How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: I don’t believe it is.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I got us a guidebook to Kyoto. I thought maybe
we’d leave tomorrow –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tell you what?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: About the bodies they found in the attic.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You were recovering from a shock. I didn’t
want to –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Karen – wait –</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital hallway - day</strong>: Karen paces down the
hall towards a RECEPTION AREA. Doug catches up with her, turning her
towards him.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, I’m sorry. I was just worried about you,
and – I know you, Karen.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: The same thing happened three years ago,
Doug. To a Japanese family, who lived in that house. They were all found
dead.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So you think the events are connected?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: How would you explain it?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay. How about this: the American family knew
about what had happened there before, and this knowledge subconsciously
caused them to repeat the same events.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s exactly how superstitions survive: if you
walk under a ladder and think uh-oh, you’re in for some bad luck, sure
enough, what do you know? You trip over –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: – trip over the curb and sprain your
ankle.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Makes sense, right?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay. Then explain this: when I went to that
house, I didn’t know anything about its past. But yet I still saw…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Saw what? Karen?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Emma and I were alone in that room, but –
there was something else there. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You watched a woman die, Kat. That’s a
horrible thing to experience. I can’t imagine how you must feel. But
sometimes the mind tries to cope with terrible things in a way that
distorts what actually occurred.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You might be right, Doug. But I know what I
saw. I think I know what I saw…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You just need to rest. We’ll get you home, get
a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’ve got class, and I’m sure I only have to
fill out a few forms or something –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m fine, Doug. Really.</p>
<p><strong>int. police station - nakagawa’s office - night</strong>:
Nakagawa is looking at the same picture, in his file.</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: This just came in. It’s the surveillance
video you requested.</p>
<p><strong>on the screen</strong>: the 10TH FLOOR HALLWAY from Susan’s
office building, and the door leading to the stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>on nakagawa</strong>: he fast-forwards the video. Until –</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: – the SECURITY GUARD appears in the
hallway. As Susan saw earlier, he opens the door to the stairwell and
looks inside. Then he closes the door and continues o.s.</p>
<p><strong>on nakagawa</strong>: he reaches forward to turn off the
video –</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: – but then the video CRACKLES with a
quick burst of static. And the door to the stairwell opens again.</p>
<p><strong>on nakagawa</strong>: he’s watching, entranced, terrified. He
can hardly believe what he’s seeing –</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: – A DARK FIGURE EMERGES FROM THE
STAIRWELL. It’s the shape of a woman with long hair –</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - night</strong>: Nakagawa stands at the front
door. Gathering his courage.</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - bathroom - night</strong>: Nakagawa’s eyes
widen as the door swings open. He sees –</p>
<p><strong>print-outs</strong>: NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS of TOSHIO and his
parents, KAYAKO and TAKEO; MATTHEW and JENNIFER; PETER; and DETECTIVES
NAKAGAWA and IGARASHI, plus reports on THE EARLIER</p>
<p><strong>from behind</strong>: Karen works the shampoo into her scalp.
But, as she does, we see something…</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I come bearing gifts.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s the boy who was there yesterday. In
that house. But this boy, he’s –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: – he’s supposed to be dead.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I saw him, Doug. I talked to him. He told me
his name. A boy who was killed by his father three years ago told me his
name.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How can I believe you, Karen?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Alex and Yoko are dead.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There’s something wrong with that house,
Doug. Something really bad. The boy in that house, he had a photo of
this man. He died on that same day three years ago. I need to talk to
his wife… widow. If I can find out what happened, or if… maybe –</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Maybe, what?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m concerned about you going out while you’re
so upset –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You don’t understand. I have to, Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Because I’ve been inside that house, Doug.
Don’t you get it? I’ve been inside!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I love you. But I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m looking for Maria Kirk?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: My name is Karen Davies. I’m a student at –
I’m sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few
questions.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Ms. Kirk?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Questions about what?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m here because… I need to speak with you
about your husband.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Maria –</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m late for work.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I just need a couple minutes.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Make yourself at home.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Your husband, Peter. Three years ago he…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He what?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m… sorry.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: How did you know Peter?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Then what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I think there’s a connection between your
husband’s death and something that happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s… hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Look, I know this sounds strange, but… I
don’t think your husband wanted to die.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Then why would he throw himself out a
window?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Let me guess: `hard to explain’?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I put all this behind me. I don’t want to
open it back up again.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If that’s true, then why are you still here
in Japan?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Because I can’t leave. I tried. But I
couldn’t. Not without…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He usually didn’t wake up before me. But that
morning, he did. He made coffee for us. Then he sat there and waited for
me to wake up. And when I did, he looked me right in the eye. And then
he jumped. The night before we’d been talking about having children
together…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Did you know a woman named Kayako?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Did Peter?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Maybe it was someone he worked with?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Look. I’ve had the police up here, I talked
with Detectives, I even hired a P.I.–</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Please. I don’t know what else to do. Please
help me.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: This is all his stuff from school.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: This was our first date.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What? Did you find something?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Happy Monday.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker</strong>: Yeah, right. Here’s your mail.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker</strong>: Another one, huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t even know her. She says I used to
tutor her, but I don’t know who the hell she is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - day</strong>: Peter stands in front of The
House.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello? Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>peter’s pov</strong>: two ARMS hang from a window at the side
of the house. They look disembodied, mottled and bruised.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My name is Peter. I’m here to see your
mother. Is she home?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey! Are you okay??? Hello???</p>
<p><strong>int. the house - entrance - day</strong>: Peter steps inside,
unsure about entering uninvited.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello? Excuse me. I’m coming in.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you alone? Where are your parents?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>on the photo</strong>: Peter unfolds the pieces and
rearranges them. We’ve seen this picture before –</p>
<p><strong>from outside, looking in</strong>: a worried look crosses
Peter’s face as the MEOW becomes more of a GROWL, as if in warning. He
looks outside, but can’t see anything –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Excuse me, I need to speak with Detective
Nakagawa.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>officer #2</strong>: One moment.</p>
<p><strong>aoki</strong>: You are asking for Detective Nakagawa?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes, I have important information for him
about a case…</p>
<p><strong>aoki</strong>: Detective Nakagawa is not here right now. Can
you tell me what case this is regarding?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: His partner, Detective Igarashi? Can I speak
with him?</p>
<p><strong>aoki</strong>: Can you tell me your name, please?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: They’re dead, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>aoki</strong>: Miss, wait please –</p>
<p><strong>int. karen’s apartment - night</strong>: A reading light on
the computer desk provides the only illumination in the dark
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Doug?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: “Hey, Karen. It’s me. I just wanted to say –
I’m sorry. I know I wasn’t hearing you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - night</strong>: Doug stands at the gate,
lighting a cigarette, looking down at the POLICE TAPE sealing the
entrance. He pockets his Zippo and ducks under the tape, walking up to
–</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - night</strong>: Karen runs towards us,
breathless, stopping as she reaches –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Doug! Where are you???</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Doug???</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Maria, it’s me. Yeah, I’m still at
school…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: …I know, I’m sorry – these staff meetings
always run over – maybe another ten minutes or so – okay, I’ll be home
soon – I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Guess your mom’s late, huh?</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: it’s a journal Kayako kept. As Peter flips
through it, KAYAKO’S VOICE speaks the words…</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: the attic panel is slightly open.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Toshio! We have to –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>thump.</strong>: Karen looks up as the sound continues. We
PAN OVER towards the stairs as A DRAGGING sound moves across the
ceiling. Accompanied by a strange SCRAPING, like plastic.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No more… please, no more…</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - night</strong>: The flashing lights of
POLICE CARS wash over the formerly quiet neighborhood, illuminating
–</p>
<p><strong>karen’s pov</strong>: the blurry forms of FIREMEN rush by in
slow motion. Everything is dizzy and incoherent…</p>
<p><strong>int. ambulance - day</strong>: …the light CHANGES. Darkness
becomes morning sunlight spilling across Karen’s face. The tranquil
sound of birds CHIRPING surrounds us. But it sounds like a distant
echo.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the house - day</strong>: It’s the most beautiful we’ve
ever seen it. A lush springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around
the place.</p>
