<p><strong>ekrem</strong>: Ozim… memnum etmek.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: We had a deal now he’s backing out.</p>
<p><strong>soyka</strong>: Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone. It’s obviously
a psychological thing…</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: Take it Ekrem.</p>
<p><strong>soyka</strong>: Ozim, it’s OK. I don’t want a shave.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: This is the kid who walks around like Al
Capone. Take the fucking ustura and finish this Rushca.</p>
<p><strong>soyka</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 3.</p>

<p><strong>anna</strong>: Did you get a name?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 4.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 1</strong>: Her stats are very poor, very poor. Baby’s
very distressed.</p>
<p><strong>junior doctor</strong>: Shoulder distocia, I think. Stuck on
the pubic bone.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Darling… darling, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Baby’s heart beat sixty… fifty- eight,
fifty-eight… fifty-seven…</p>
<p><strong>junior doctor</strong>: Anna, I’m trying to rotate the

<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 5.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 1</strong>: Baby stats sixty-eight and in free
fall.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: I’m not getting a pulse.</p>
<p><strong>aziz</strong>: Speak to me…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We need to get the baby out now.</p>
<p><strong>aziz</strong>: OK, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: My name is Tatiana. My father died in the
mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died. We were all
buried there. Buried under the soil of Russia. That is why I left to
find a better life.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You had a girl.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 6.</p>
<p><strong>aziz</strong>: Ok. Call it.</p>
<p><strong>junior doctor</strong>: Unidentified woman, died December

<p><strong>aziz</strong>: Merry Christmas, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh, don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>aziz</strong>: And you have to open it in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>aziz</strong>: At least pretend.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: In the whole entire history of my life, I have
never felt this special.</p>
<p><strong>aziz</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 7.</p>
<p><strong>aziz</strong>: Wear them. It’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: I am so excited this morning. Yesterday a
friend came back to our village and he told us all about the places on
the map that I look at… Paris, Amsterdam, London. He’s been there for
real…</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: …he said the future of everything was
already happening in all those places.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A bit.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There’s no point us tiptoeing around if
you’re not even sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Mum? Are you OK?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 8.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Of course not. It’s Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s the chicken. The smell of chicken
roasting reminds me of him.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You should have done beef, then.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It wouldn’t be Christmas without tears in the
gravy, would it.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: Anna! Anna! Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s your own fault for giving him something
to play with.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, I can’t read Russian, can I?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 9.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found it in the
handbag of a girl who died in my ward.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: Do you always rob the bodies of the
dead?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Of course, we all do it. It’s one of the perks
of working in a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: Did you know that your daughter robs the
bodies of the dead?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 10.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Stepan, is there an address?</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: You have an uncle who doesn’t steal things
from the dead. Not even their secrets.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, don’t go all momentous on us, Stepan.
Lift your elbows.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: You should put this in her coffin, Anna.
Bury her secrets with her bodies.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Body. Singular.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How long will dinner be?</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: When I was little, London was like a place
in the Bible. I wasn’t even sure if it was real. My friend has told me
there is a place in London where they pay girls to sing.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 11.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: He said if I sang in this restaurant I
would make more money in a week than my father made in a year.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: So you pick up Ozim and his bitch of a wife
and you bring them back here.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Then I’ll think of an excuse and we can get
away.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’ll think of an excuse. Your excuses are
like fucking fairy tales.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Who the fuck’s that?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 12.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You’re so… fucking unbelievably
disrespectful.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Hey, you’ve got work to do. Go…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: We are closed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sorry… I’m a midwife.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 13.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Then unless one of my daughters is keeping
something from me, you have the wrong address.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’d like to speak to the Manager.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Khitrova?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: My dad was Russian.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: And his name?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ivan.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: So, you are Anna Ivanovna.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: We must hurry. I must stir. Stir, stir or
the gravy dies in my hands. Today it is family. Here is my son, Kirill.
Kirill! The berries are too low, too low. And Roman, more glasses for
red! Come on!</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 13A.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 14.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: My angels. You should be practising. You
must make the wood cry. Like this, like this…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: You see…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Come, come, hurry, hurry. They will be here
any moment. Ok, show me this card.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: It is the old card. From before the
renovations. But even so, if she had worked here I would remember the
name. Perhaps she ate here once. Try this.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: God, that’s amazing. My dad made gravy just
like that.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 15.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: So did you get a chance to talk to this girl
before she died?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: This is an agency that hires casual kitchen
staff. Maybe you will have more luck there. But I think they will be
closed until New Year.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Papa, Ozim is here.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Ten minutes!! Fish, fish, fish! Ten minutes!
OK, Kirill, get him a drink and tell him I am coming.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 16.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Anna, I’m so sorry I couldn’t help. It is
sad.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s OK. I’ll probably find out more when I
get her diary translated.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Her diary?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I found her diary in her bag.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Why did you not tell me you found a
diary?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: OK, Anna, this is how it will be. You will
bring the diary here and I will translate it for you. Then if we get the
names of any relatives I will call them myself. I am something of a…
community leader for the Russians here in this unfriendly city. What do
you say?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I was going to ask my uncle….</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: And when you come I will make you some more
gravy like your papa used to make and you can try the</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 17.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: fish with the sauce. OK? Tomorrow, yes?
Shall we say seven?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Then it is settled. But for now, you must
forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Dosvedania.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Dosvedania.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Oh Anna, you always work at the Trafalgar
hospital?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes, always.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Hey, you OK? You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, thanks. I’m driving.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 18.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: OK. Merry Christmas. Drive safely.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Nice bike.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Nice bike.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: A Ural. You don’t see them anymore.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It was my dad’s.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: How much do you want for it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It has sentimental value.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 18A.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: `Sentimental value’. I’ve heard of
that.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 19.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You’re not staying for the party?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Nor me. Chauffeurs don’t get invited. You
want to go for a drink instead?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s Christmas. Everything’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Sometimes if things are closed you just
open them up, you know?</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend
isn’t here to carve?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t live with Oliver any more, Uncle
Stepan. I’m living back here for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: For as long as you want.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I knew he would run away from you.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 20.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He didn’t run away. You make me sound like a
burning building.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: Black men always run away.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh Stepan!</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: What? I am allowed to be honest?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He was a doctor, Stepan.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What the hell has that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: It is not natural to mix race and race. That
is why your baby died inside you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stepan, shut up! Please Anna.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re just how he was. Stupid bloody drunken
Russians.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 21.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s Christmas. I’m thirty-one.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Anna, you know what he’s like.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t give a damn about Stepan. Who has that
poor baby got in the whole world?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I knew this would happen.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Good. Fine. So you know everything.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Anna, she isn’t your responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The baby is my responsibility until I hand her
over to the mother. The mother is dead.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Then it’s up to the proper authorities.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The proper authorities will all be skiing
until after New Year.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s part of the grieving.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What grieving?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 22.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: In the last year you’ve lost your father and
you lost a baby.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come in and have your dinner.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: He’s called Goofy… Goofy yeah. So the coast
is clear, yeah? What? I said `coast’.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 22A.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: No, not the beach. It’s an English
expression, you fucking baboon. I mean… …there are no police. You sure?
Good.</p>
<p>****: GREEN Revision - 11/24/06 23.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: No, my dad’s not involved. I’m a big boy
now. I do my own stuff. Yeah. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: The driver stays down here.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You really think I do this kind of
thing?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: This guy’s not a driver. He’s an
undertaker.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun,
durgun.</p>
<p><strong>ekrem</strong>: I got tickets, Ozim. It’s with Chelsea. They
said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: OK, OK, OK. You go and watch a DVD, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: He knows to say he hasn’t seen us, right
Ozim?</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: He don’t know anything. He’s touched by the
angels.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 25.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: There was a time when he was like a brother
to me.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Now he looks like a fucking ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: Hey, hey, show some respect for a dead
man.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Respect? This is respect.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: OK, Nikolai, he’s all yours. And show some
respect. This Muslim is scared of ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Have you got a hair dryer?</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 26.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You’d better burn that.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Did you finish cutting his hair?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I just thought you might want six- fifty
out of his pockets.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 27.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: OK, now I’m going to do his teeth and cut
off his fingers. You might want to leave the room.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You too, Kirill.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Aren’t you going to weight him down or
something?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: If you want to dump a body, this is the
place. The currents keep it under the surface until past the
barrier.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: My friend said he would get me to Amsterdam
and from there we could find a way into London. I have been practising
my singing and</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 28.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: have even rejoined the church choir. I am
also practising my English.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: My friend says his uncle owns the
restaurant where you can sing. He is sure this man will take care of
me.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Ah. My dear! I wasn’t expecting you so
early.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is it OK?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I copied the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Where is the original?</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 29.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m going to keep it. Maybe give it to
Tatiana’s daughter someday.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I will need my spectacles and a clear head.
Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate
it.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Then I will bring what I have done to your
home. Where do you live, Anna?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Not far. I can drop by and pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Then maybe I can drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m fine. I’m on my motorbike.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: So what will happen to the poor child?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: After Christmas, they’ll do a missing persons
report.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Who will?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The police.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 30.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m too sad. Next Christmas isn’t for another
hundreds and hundreds of days.</p>

<p><strong>maria</strong>: You shouldn’t smoke, Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: We’re partners now, man, you know?</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 31.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What? You never seen anybody pissed
before?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Come on, Kirill. Where are your keys?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Who are you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: We went to a Kurdish place. They don’t even
celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 32.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Hey, Papa, what did I do? This is Merry
Christmas or what?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I think he’s had enough.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Who… the fuck… are you to tell me
enough?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: We’re partners.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: He’s thunder, I’m lightning. He makes all
the noise, I do all the damage.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I hired you as a driver…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: …someone to stop him killing himself.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Well, you got more than a driver.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I run a mini-cab business.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 33.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Albanians, Chechens, Russians. They deliver
packages. Anything. Anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I only took this job so that I could get to
meet you. I think you and I could do business together.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I have no idea what business you’re talking
about. Now get out.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You’ve got water in it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Water? What makes you think that?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: The postmen used these. In my village. When
I was a boy. Russian copy of BMW flat twin.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 33A.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 34.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Get a bus.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You got far to go?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Just across the park.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’m a driver. I even do limousines.
Look…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: If Semyon found out I let one of his guests
walk home in the rain, he’d fire me. And I can take care of your bike.
So…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: So you’re a midwife. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What’s it like?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I didn’t faint, but it was close.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 35.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How many have you got?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What, you don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yeah, I know, I know, it’s just… it makes
me upset, you know? Thinking about it. This time of year. They’re back
in Yekaterinburg. In the forests. Near the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Left here.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So Semyon employs you?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’m… sort of freelance.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You said he’d fire you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Did you ever meet a girl called Tatiana?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I meet lots of girls called Tatiana.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: She was pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: In that case, no, I never heard of her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: She died last night on my shift.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 36.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I thought you did birth.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sometimes birth and death go together. She had
needle punctures all over both arms. Dehydration, emaciation. Early
presentation of syphilis. Probably a prostitute. At the age of
fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You know what? I hate the rain. This time
of year. You ever been to Russia at Christmas? Man, snow that covers
your whole house.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Oh yeah. And the ice. Whole lakes covered
in ice. You don’t want to walk across them, though. Ice gets thin where
you least expect it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You think Semyon’s son knew her?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Like I said, I’m a driver. I go left, I go
right, I go straight ahead. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Just here is great.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How much do I owe you?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 37.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We think he might be Russian Mafia.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He is actually a Chechen. He is also a member
of the vory v zakone. The stars on the knees mean he would never kneel
before anyone.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: In Russian prisons, your life story is written
on your body in tattoos. You don’t exist without tattoos. He was a
captain.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 37A.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 37B.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But he has been processed professionally.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 38.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: There was something else. It was… inside
the body. Chest cavity.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Anna?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stepan, come here. Tell her what you told
me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What? Stepan, what? I’m late for work.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Who gave you that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It was on the dresser.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Mum, you can’t go through my things.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 38A.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You wanted him to translate it.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 39.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And he said he wouldn’t do it so I’ve found
somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: No Anna! You don’t go to someone else with
this! You don’t go to anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape. Iglah, it
means needle. Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I go to wash my hands.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Anna, Stepan said this girl ended up in the
hands of the vory v zakone. Do you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Just because I’m back in this room doesn’t
mean I’m twelve again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You never listened to me even then!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Look, if I don’t find a relative in the next
few days they’ll put Christine out for fostering. Once she’s in the
system, she’ll never get out again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Who named her Christine?</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 40.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I had to call her something. It sounds like
Christmas. She’s very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If I can persuade Stepan to translate it,
will you leave the rest to the police?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Tell him I’ve heard bad words before.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your father used to say the vory are a
contagious disease. There’s no cure once they’ve touched you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Momma, this is London.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 41.</p>
<p><strong>albanian</strong>: OK, boss is here. Boss, boss. You make him
happy…</p>
<p><strong>albanian</strong>: No fucking crying. It’s a party!</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: So he said to me, `who is this driver guy?’
I laughed so hard.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: And I said you were the safest guy I’d met.
Solid.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: And what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You know my dad. He didn’t say nothing. But
his eyes looked impressed.</p>
<p><strong>albanian</strong>: Kirill!</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Get out of the fucking way, you black gypsy
baboon.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 42.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: OK, which one you going to fuck!?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Serious. Pick one.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’m just enjoying myself, man…</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You hear me? You’re going to fuck one of
these girls.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: OK, OK, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You’re going to fuck one of these girls
right now. That’s an order.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What? What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 43.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Come on Nikolai. Who are you going to
fuck?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: I’m recommending you to my dad. I want to
make sure you’re not a fucking queer.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You’ve drunk enough Kirill.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Enough?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You fucking Siberian ox don’t tell a vor
what is enough.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: I’ve brought you to my dad’s best stable. He
uses this place himself. They’re all clean. Now I’m going to watch you
fuck one of these girls to prove to me that you ain’t queer.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: So which one is it going to be?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Her.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You did OK! You did OK.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Well if my examination is over, get the
fuck out of here while I get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What’s your last name?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Tell me your last name.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Kirilenko.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 45.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Where? Which village? Which town?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Irpen. Outside Kiev.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Stay alive a little longer.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Hello Anna. I came on tiptoes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 45A.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: There are always open doors, Anna
Ivanovna.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 46.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re not allowed in here.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Please Anna, let me speak.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I translated the diary…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I was shocked to discover… that my son
Kirill is mentioned many times.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I have known for some years that he has
strayed from the path I set out for him. His mother died when he was
very young.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What does it say about him?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Many bad things.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: But Anna please. Let me deal with him. If
the diary should find its way to the police…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Some of the things my son did are illegal.
Anna, he is a good boy.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 47.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t care about him. I care about the
baby.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Of course. Of course. And that is the
baby?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Anna, I have made some inquiries and I have
found out an address for Tatiana’s family in Russia. That’s where the
baby belongs, no?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: So… perhaps we can do a deal.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Do you understand me, Anna?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Anna?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s OK. He’s just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: You know where I am, Anna Ivanovna.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: And I know where you are.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 48.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: I was thrown down the stairs and fell onto
some sacks, like potato sacks…</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: …like potato sacks. Kirill came down after
me and he hit me until I was bleeding. Then he tried to rape me but he
couldn’t do it… He just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. In
the end his father came down. It was the father who raped me. He shouted
at his son…‘if you don’t break a horse, it will never be tame,
Kirill’.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello dear. How was your night?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stepan’s arthritis is playing up. I’m taking
dictation.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Would you like some tea or something?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 49.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He came to see me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The man from the restaurant. He came to the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I told you this would happen! I told
you!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Sit down Stepan.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: The devil is loose now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I know it’s my fault…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s no one’s fault…</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: They are in this room now. They are
cancer…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We should just sit down calmly and think…</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I have a friend from Ukraine who owns a
gun….</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stepan!!</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: …from the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 50.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t talk about guns…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Shut up both of you!!!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: OK… now… what would dad have done?</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: We all know what he would have done.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And then he would have been practical.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: He would ask if there were bullets for the
gun.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No! This isn’t our world. We’re just…
ordinary people.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I dealt with the vory v zakone when I worked
for the KGB.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You never worked for the fucking</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I was an auxiliary!</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 51.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What did this man want?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The diary. In return he’ll give us an address
for Tatiana’s family. For Christine’s family.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And that’s all he wants?</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: You cannot do deals with these people!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This isn’t a deal. It’s an exchange of
information.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: Have you forgotten already what I just read
to you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We must be practical.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Stepan, I think he was threatening to harm
Christine.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Then it’s settled.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: No!! No!! No!!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stepan, this isn’t our world. We are ordinary
people.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 52.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: She was an ordinary person.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Hey, come on, Nikolai, I’ve got a Christmas
present for you.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Open one.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: From France. Old as fuck. Old is good with
wine. Sixty quid a bottle anywhere. Except I got them for ten quid a
case.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: From where?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: `From where?’ From where you don’t ask. Give
it here…</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 53.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: If my dad says OK, I can start telling you
about the serious stuff. Import, export. This booze is just for gifts to
Papa’s friends. The real import stuff is from Kabul, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Import-export sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You bet it’s fucking good…</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Jesus Christ, Papa… You scared me….</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: What’s wrong? We’re just sampling it!</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Your friend Soyka is dead.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Yeah? So what? What’s that got to do with
me?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Don’t lie to me!!</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 54.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: I swear I don’t know nothing about it…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I said, don’t lie to me!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Your dad is right, Kirill. There’s no point
lying to him.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Ozim’s nephew slit Soyka’s throat. Kirill
paid him to do it.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Shut your fucking mouth!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Your dad always knows the truth anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: But it’s OK boss. You don’t have to
worry…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I don’t have to worry?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I disposed of the body myself. The police
won’t find a thing.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: My son commits a murder?</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 55.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: On my own doorstep? A fellow soldier! And no
one thought to tell me about it?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: The vory code says you don’t talk to
anybody about your captain. Kirill is my captain.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: When I found out what had happened, I did
what I had to do to clean the situation up.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: It was a matter of honor. Soyka was
spreading lies about Kirill. About your family. Kirill did the right
thing.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I decide what is right and what is wrong.
You do not kill a vor for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You know as well as I do Soyka was talking
to the police.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: For a driver, you are well informed.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’ve got connections with the Chechens who
export cars. Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk. Scotland Yard.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 56.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Kirill did a good thing for all our people.
Our people will know that.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Papa, I swear to you, I was going to…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: If you are so well informed, you will know
Soyka has brothers.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: That’s OK. Kirill has got me.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Get these boxes out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You heard him, patsan! Get these boxes out
of sight.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 57.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How the hell can you eat?</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s their driver.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tell me you haven’t done anything
ridiculous…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Meet in a public place with lots of people
around. Very wise.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: And I see you brought along a body guard.
Also very wise.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 58.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: When I was in the KGB, we knew how to deal
with scum like you.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: When you were in what?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Shush, Stepan. Anna?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Now you give me the address.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: What address?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Tatiana’s family.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>stepan</strong>: I told you! I knew they would do this….</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Anna! No! Come back here!</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 59.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: She was fourteen! Read the diary! She was
fourteen when he raped her!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You murdered her! You bastards murdered
her!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Anger is very dangerous. It makes people do
stupid things. Forget any of this ever happened. You’re in the wrong
place, Anna Ivanovna.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You belong in there. With nice people. Stay
away from people like me.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: I am not sure I can carry on another day.
The windows won’t open so I can’t throw myself out. They inject me every
day with heroin.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 60.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: Sometimes I think this is all a
hallucination…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: It is good to have someone who I can trust
to do simple tasks.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: In this business, sometimes the biggest
danger comes from the most stupid things. You can’t afford to be
careless in any area.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Nasdrovia.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Nasdrovia.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: So what was the lie that Soyka was spreading
about my son?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: It was nothing important.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Kirill had him killed for nothing
important?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I don’t want to repeat it.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 61.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: For me you will repeat it.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: You play with the Prince to do business with
the King. But if you want to do business with me you must be open with
me. Thieves- in-law.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: What was Soyka saying about the Prince?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: That he is a drunk. And that he is also… a
queer.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: My only son.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: You know it never snows in this City. And
it’s never hot. London is a city of whores and queers. My son…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: …I think London is to blame for what he
is…</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 62.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: So why don’t you go home?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: The cold gets into my bones.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: And also… the KGB would be waiting for
me.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: FSB. They are called FSB now.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Whatever they call them they are worse even
than the KGB were. Maybe the KGB and the vory v zakone were partners in
a marriage. We had rules, they had rules.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Now in Moscow, the thieves don’t wear
tattoos and the police don’t wear uniforms. You never know who they
are…</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: You’ve heard about these new policemen?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: They get under you, over you, behind you,
inside you. They are the ones you least expect.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 63.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: The midwife said she had an uncle. A
Russian.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I met him.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: So you know what he looks like.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: She said he has read the diary.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: We can’t trust a Russian with that kind of
information.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Perhaps you can deal with him.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 64.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I thought I’d bring it back before it got
stolen. Lot of villains around. Sorry about the chain.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I got that address you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: A little village outside St. Petersburg. I
know it. Not much of a place for a kid to grow up in. Especially not a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: If you want my opinion, the kid would be
better off in London. Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana’s family don’t
sound like the kind of people who’d want another mouth to feed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You read the diary?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So how can you keep doing what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I told you. I’m just a driver.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You look the other way.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 65.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I’m a camera. The pictures stay in my
head.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why did you bring me this?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I don’t know. I was passing.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Oh, and… your uncle.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Is it true he was in the KGB?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Well, he’s a brave old man. That’s for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Does he live with you?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I fixed it. It should be OK now.</p>

Aliverisme!! Fucker!</p>

them.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Tell them to give you two days.</p>
<p><strong>tatiana</strong>: I know now for sure that I am pregnant. It
hasn’t begun to show yet. After I was raped they made me take pills but

the pain.</p>

<p><strong>kirill</strong>: That girl you fucked in front of me… you
remember her? The Ukrainian bitch?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: So they kick down the door. These are
ordinary fucking police. They ask for her by name and they take her
away. Some fucking punter must have given them her name. What gives the
police the right to take our women, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Hey Papa, I never seen so many old people in

realize more and more what he’s like. Here, drink to the Georgian
girl…</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 76.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: What? I drink alone now.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: He offered me stars. I accepted them.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You think I didn’t know already? He told me
before. It was my fucking idea. He said there are a lot of things I have
to teach you.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Some stuff will take a long time. I’ve been
protecting you until now.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: You think I don’t know stuff you don’t know?
I am vor by birth. The stars are a birthmark for me…</p>

celebrate. Help me with these bottles.</p>

<p><strong>gypsy</strong>: You were not co-operative?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I spent two years in the punishment
block.</p>
<p><strong>valery</strong>: You went through the Crosses in
St. Petersburg?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I was in solitary confinement fifteen
times. I was called ‘The Stump’ because they couldn’t shift me.</p>
<p><strong>valery</strong>: Your father was a bitch and a weak fucker
for working with the Government, that’s right isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: That’s right. My father means nothing to
me. My Mother….</p>
<p><strong>gypsy</strong>: You have no mother. She was a whore
anyway.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 79.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yes. I have no mother and no father. There
is only the code, the vory v zakone code which I have always
followed.</p>
<p><strong>valery</strong>: That is why there is an empty place above
your heart. Where the stars will go. And why there is an empty place on

fifteen. Now I live in the zone all the time.</p>

<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t think the driver would do anything to
Stepan.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 81.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How do you know what he would do?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You haven’t spoken to him since, have
you?</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: Semyon recommends these places for business
meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: Come on. We have a lot to get through. Let’s
cook.</p>
<p><strong>73 omitted 73</strong>: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 82.</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: Our lines to Kabul get broken every two or
three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: The Americans. Fucking NATO. Valery Nabokov
imports flowers and television sets into this country. The television
sets are one in ten. That means one in ten have cargo inside them.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Where do they dock?</p>
<p><strong>ozim</strong>: I will tell you when I return from the
bathroom.</p>

<p><strong>aziz</strong>: You can’t possibly dump me. We’re not even
going out.</p>

<p><strong>anna</strong>: Feel my pulse.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m going to apply to adopt Christine.</p>

<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I thought you did birth.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: My uncle….</p>

<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: He’s in Scotland. In Edinburgh. In a
five-star hotel.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 87.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Edinburgh?</p>

here without any. Can you get me some?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I can’t walk out of here naked.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You can’t walk out of here because you’re
attached to a drip. Explain Edinburgh.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Your uncle knew too much.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I was told to get rid of him. I was meant
to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head. Instead I sent him to
Edinburgh. With a first-class ticket.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: He is of the old school. He understood the
situation. Exile or death. Edinburgh was his idea. He said they throw a
great party at New Year. And he said it was a good excuse to get away
from his family.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: So… just a pair of jeans and a T- shirt. A
jacket. And some shoes.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD Revision - 11/27/06 88.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: The hotel is called the Caledonian.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: …no, I couldn’t get much sense out of him, he
was drunk.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Mum, I don’t want to tell you how I found him
because I don’t want another argument. I just wanted you to know he’s
definitely safe…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, we can’t tonight. I’m working. I need the
money. For a place of my own, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You got my message?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Using a dead body to file a progress report
must be against FSB regulations.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: It’s called improvisation.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You’ve been improvising quite a lot lately.
And taking risks.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Maybe too many.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You didn’t come here to give me
flowers…</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 90.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: In light of what has happened to you…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Ah, Christ…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: …and in light of other violent incidents
associated with you, the Russian desk at Scotland Yard have made an
official request to the Russian embassy that your undercover operation
in London be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You have gone beyond what was agreed.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: In my opinion you should see this as good
news. You’ve been in the zone far too long…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: If they terminate the operation now, they
will be wasting this…</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 91.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: You tell the Russian desk you saw stars
over my heart. OK? Tell them I’m through the door.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: They are bound to ask… who did you kill?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Tell them I only killed myself.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: And you can tell them I’m going to replace
Semyon at the head of the London organization.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What drugs are they giving you? Maybe it’s the
anesthetic speaking.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: I need you to take Semyon out of the
picture. I want you to arrest him.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Arrest him for what?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Rape.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: The girl was fourteen.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 92.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: And of course, she will testify…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: She doesn’t have to. She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: But she had Semyon’s baby. If you prove the
baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was
conceived, that’s statutory rape.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: All you need is the baby and some of
Semyon’s DNA. For poetic reasons I suggest you take his blood.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You intrigue me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: If we had never had this conversation they
would have sent you home. You could have spent the Spring in the
mountains. Riding your bicycle to your office every morning through
fields of flowers.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Why stay?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You keep in touch.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 93.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: And take care, Mikhail.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: How is Uncle Stepan?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They’re from the morgue. They belonged to
someone who died yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t believe I’m doing a favor for someone
just because he had the decency not to murder a member of my family.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Hey… wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Is your bike still working OK?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeah. It’s OK.</p>
<p>****: 94</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Did you get in touch with Tatiana’s family
in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: So the baby’s still in England.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: She’s staying here for good.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why do you care?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Stepan said you were kind to him. He said you
were risking your own life to keep him alive.</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yeah, and all the thanks I get is a pair of
dead man’s shoes. I listen to you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do you really?</p>
<p><strong>nikolai</strong>: Yes. About Semyon and the baby. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You thank me for that?</p>

<p><strong>maria</strong>: It sounded like something.</p>

Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Did you fight each other? I heard
banging.</p>
<p>****: PINK Revision - 11/12/06 96.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: No. It’s not a fight if one of you doesn’t
fight back.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: So, today I do as I am told.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Maria. Go upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: You’ll have a drink, Yuri…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I don’t drink on duty.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Sometimes I don’t believe you are really
Russian.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’ve told you, I am half Russian.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Then have half a drink.</p>
<p>****: WHITE Revision - 9/12/06 97.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: So what is all this nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We just need a blood sample.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We can take the sample right now voluntarily
or I can get an order from the court. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: He sits there like a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What, you are afraid of needles, Semyon?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I am afraid of… conspiracies.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I will return tomorrow with a court order.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Wait. I’ve done nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: What did they want with you, papa?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: To poison me.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: They took blood from me with a needle.
Probably the same needle they use for all the junkies and whores and
blacks and queers.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Now I probably have the fucking queer
disease.</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Why would they want your blood, papa?</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: Someone is ahead of me. I don’t like people
ahead of me.</p>
<p>****: BLUE Revision - 11/4/06 99.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: What the hell did that cocksucker want with
my blood?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Maybe it’s about the baby.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: What baby?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: Some bitch was out there saying you were the
father of a baby.</p>
<p><strong>semyon</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: It was nothing. Just some bitch…</p>
