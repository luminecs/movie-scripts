<p><strong>second draft screenplay</strong>: REVISED 2-3-87</p>
<p><strong>from an original screenplay</strong>: BY MICHAEL MCDOWELL</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, well, you’re a big fella…!</p>
<p><strong>adam and barbara maitland</strong>: ARE ON VACATION!
HOORAY!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m ready!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It looks great.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Happy vacation, honey!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Manchurian Tung oil? Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Helen got it for me in Oslo. There’s enough
to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Adam… it’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Enough to do the guest room…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m so glad we’re spending our vacation at
home… … I’m going to get started <u>right</u> <u>now</u>!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Whoa!… hold on…</p>
<p><strong>adam &amp; barbara</strong>: No one’s home!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s <u>your</u> turn, darling.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi, Barb! I’m glad I caught you. I heard you
were on vacation!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’s right, Jane. <u>Complete</u>
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Honey – today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u>
thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No! Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is
really real! From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
My buyer has just made a killing in condos in Manhattan, but he’s got a
little stress problem… … so – he wants to bring the wife and kid for the
old peace and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’s what we’re looking for, too.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just listen now.
This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a
family.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, honey… I didn’t mean anything… it’s just
too big for you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: ’Bye, Jane, see you in a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, honey. You said no <u>Inkspots</u> on
this vacation!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: <u>Boo</u>!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Honey, come with me down to the store?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I need a good brush for this Tung oil and I
want to pick up a piece of the model. Let’s go early before anyone sees
us.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Okay, but let’s hurry back. You just run in
okay?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Jane said we should sell the house to
someone with a family.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We should be flattered that she wants to sell
our house.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I know… I just wish she’d leave us
alone.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s not think about it. We’ll have a nice
romantic, quiet, vacation. Here comes the bridge chorus.</p>
<p><strong>together</strong>: Chances are… When I wear a foolish
grin…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Wave at the lion.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t forget the balls, Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Adam!</p>
<p><strong>jane butterfield</strong>: ANTIQUES REAL ESTATE TRAVEL</p>
<p><strong>int. antique store real estate office travel agency
-</strong>: DAY</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Y… ello. Mrs. Deetz? Well the condition is
what we country folk call, fixin’… Yes, I think they are fixin’ to
accept another offer. Well maybe if you offer 390,000 they’ll take
it.</p>
<p><strong>old bill</strong>: ’Morning, Adam. You need a haircut before
your vacation?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No thanks, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>old bill</strong>: How’s the model coming?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good, Bill – Good.</p>
<p><strong>old bill</strong>: Y’know, I was thinkin’… you said Bozman
built the foundation in 1835 but y’know his grandson came in here last
week and said he found a bottle with an 1836 stamp in it plastered in
the foundation. He’s got hair down to his goddamned shoulders…</p>
<p><strong>old bill</strong>: He said “Just give me a trim…” I took a
scissors to him so fast… would’ve skimmed him clean if he hadn’t…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: See you, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>old bill</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s a beauty.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah it turned out okay. We applied for a
historical plaque for it. That’ll be the third one on Main Street.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: With all these historical landmarks in
town, where are they going to put the condominiums?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Slow down there, honey… I don’t want the
vibration to weaken the model.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Something like this <u>always</u> happens
when we try to go on vacation. <u>Always</u>.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’ll feel better when you’re dry.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: This fire wasn’t burning when we left the
house.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How’s your arm?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m not sure. It feels… frozen.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You’d better sit down, hon.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I am sitting.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll tell you what, Barbara. I don’t think we
survived that crash.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Adam. We’re home. In our own house.
Nonsense. I’ll make some coffee. You get some more firewood.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s take things extra slow. Do you remember
how we got back up here?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m fine. My arm works fine.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The end of a perfect day.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Honey, I’m gonna go down to the bridge and
retrace our steps.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Adam!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Barbara?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You saved my – uh – life… or whatever…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Two hours.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’s how long you were gone.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: … Hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Anything happen while I was away?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes, it did. Yes, it did. I made a couple
of small discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: There’s that, and there’s this.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Handbook for the recently diseased.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: De<u>ceased</u>. I don’t know where it came
from. Look at the publisher.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t think we survived the crash.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t like situations like this. I hate
it when I’m not in control. So just tell me the basics.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This book isn’t arranged that way. What do you
want to know?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: There are a thousand things… Why did you
disappear when you walked off the front porch? Is this a punishment? Are
we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this
going to <u>last</u>?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t see anything about “Rewards and
Punishments” or “Heaven and Hell.” This book reads like stereo
instructions! Listen to this… ’Geographical and Temporal Perimeters…
Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.” This is
going to take some time.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I knew I’d never finish the guest room.
Adam, we just can’t stay in here forever!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe we should set up a normal routine.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I mean, let’s try to nail down something in
our lives. A regular schedule. We can keep track of time and go on with
our projects up here in the attic.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, God, maybe this is all just a bad
dream.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m afraid not, honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Why? What’s wrong? Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I wish I had a better view of the cemetery
from up here. I don’t know which area is the best placement for us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cabin fever, han?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I can’t clean anything. The vacuum is out
in the garage. I can’t leave the house. Why don’t they tell us
something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it
just you and me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe this is heaven.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: In heaven there wouldn’t be dust on the
wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hon… I didn’t want to die, but really, this is
fine with me. Look, we never have to wash dishes again.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Dishes? We haven’t eaten in three weeks!
Adam, I’m not like you. I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get
out to the church and go grocery shopping.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But I’m not hungry, are you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I keep having this feeling that something
has got to happen.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: God, it’s Jane.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What’s she doing here?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t know. <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: She can’t see you, right?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: In the book, Rule Number Two: the living
usually won’t see the dead.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Won’t? Or can’t?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Just says “won’t.” Wait a minute. Here it
says “the living are arrogant… they think they’ll never die, so they
refuse to see the dead.”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Arrogant. That’s Jane all right…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: At least we won’t have to worry about
her.</p>
<p><strong>moving man #1</strong>: Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Don’t worry. It was going anyway.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Jesus. Who lived here? The Waltons?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Get all this other crap out of here.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Where is your father?… probably in the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The <u>noise</u> in that kitchen. Noisy
refrigerator, noisy faucets… We’ll have to replace it all. I want no
humming in the house.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What do you think, honey?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Delia hates it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I could live here.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Settle down, Lydia. I wonder <u>where</u> we
are going to get counseling for you out here.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: It’s Otho!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Otho, why didn’t you just come in the
door?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: It’s bad luck. And I believe hugely in
luck.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Hold your breath and we’ll pull.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: That was the single most unattractive window
treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I’m <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city
to consult me, Otho.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Yes, of course you are. Well, Otho had an
intuition. Call it a hunch – that it was going to be a fabled
monstrosity of a house. And it certainly is. Charles, you’re lucky the
yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I’m going to have to
do to this place. We are talking <u>from</u> <u>the ground
ups’ville</u>!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: That’s fine, Otho. Just keep me out of it.
I am here to relax and clip coupons. And goddamnit, I mean to do it.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Is the rest of the house as bad as this?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: The rest of the house is probably worse. When
can you and I get started?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: No time like the present, as my wicked
stepmother used to say.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Delia, let’s get this show on the road.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell. I hate these
people.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: They make Jane look good.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Is this a punishment for something we did
in life? What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We’re not completely helpless. I’ve been
reading the book. There’s a word for people in our predicament,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: <u>Ghosts</u>!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: We’re dealing with negative entertainment
potential here. I mean, there’s absolutely no organic walking
flow-through.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: I thought I saw something.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: You read my <u>mind</u>! I love clients who
can read my mind. I don’t think people realize how strong a connection
there is between interior design and the supernatural.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: <u>I know</u>… I read your book, <u>The</u>
<u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Gooood!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: This will be Lydia’s room.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Viridian?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Viridian? What is…?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Blue-green! Hydrated chromic oxide! Remember
I’m schooled in chemistry. I was a hair analyst! Briefly. Interior
design is a <u>science</u>, Delia! Think of me as Doctor Otho. And this
patient is truly <u>sick</u>!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Of course, her favorite color! How
<u>beautiful</u>!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other
closets are bigger than this one.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Were these people dwarfes? Oooooo!… Look!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Ozzie… … and… Harriet! What <u>happened</u> to
these people?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: They died.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Ooo. Deliver me from L.L. Bean!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: This room is <u>off limits</u>. I don’t
want either of you to touch one piece of furniture in here. This is
<u>my</u> room.</p>
<p><strong>adam’s head</strong>: They don’t see us. They can’t hear
us.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: The woman who lived here had the aesthetic
instincts of Betty Crocker.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m going to get her.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I cannot convey to you the extent to which
this house <u>bores</u> me.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a
few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and – perhaps – think about an
inground pool – the place <u>might</u> just be livable. What’s on the
third floor?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Attic space.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Let’s see. We could turn that into a media
room.</p>
<p><strong>adam’s head</strong>: Oh, God. I forgot to lock the attic
door!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Did you feel something?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: I felt a cool wind.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: You don’t have a key?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Maybe Charles does.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: I have a feeling there’s some very interesting
space behind this door.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Probably the world’s largest <u>Reader’s
Digest</u> collection! C’mon, let’s have some chablis, Otho, I’m laid
bare by this experience. Entirely bare.</p>
<p><strong>adam’s head</strong>: Whew! That was close.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I cannot witness this.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What’s the good of being a ghost if you
can’t frighten people to death?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, honey…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, I’m not putting up with this.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Barbara, honey! Don’t go out there. You don’t
know –</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Nothing can be worse than this…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Barbara!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Barbara!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh Adam. <u>Find</u> somebody. I’m getting
all yellow. <u>Do</u> something!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Adam, don’t ever leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I know. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I just realized that I could have been
killed alone. Don’t ever leave me, honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We’re trapped in this house forever… with
those… people.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You can’t say that for sure. It could be a
transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis. We just have to be tougher
with them. Come on. Have some brandy. Spirits?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Death didn’t improve your sense of
humor.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I can’t believe that we’re eating Cantonese.
Is there no Szechuan up here? Hunan?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: There’s only one Chinese restaurant out
here, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook
Cantonese. They don’t know better.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I plan to have a stroke from the amount of
MSG that’s in this food.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.
Why don’t we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant
one?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Lydia, relax. We’ll build you a darkroom in
the basement.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: My whole life is a darkroom! One… big… dark…
room.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Nonsense… you’ll go to school, maybe meet a
farm boy.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Yeah, maybe if he’s nice, he’ll let me hang
myself from a rope in his barn.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Lydia, in a couple of years this whole town
will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: We’ll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New
York. I’ll start sculpting again… I’ll teach those gallery bastards to
refuse my sculpture. And when Otho and I get through with this house,
you people are not going to recognize it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I say let’s keep it the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Good idea!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I do. I really like it. I mean, it’s already
sort of like somebody’s home, isn’t it? Their couch is comfortable and
doesn’t stick to your legs. It smells like a real home, not a French
whorehouse.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u>
<u>young</u>. Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield
tomorrow and get the key to the attic door. Can’t you find a way to hold
back some of her commission?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: We’re going to have a lot to do tomorrow…
The Goodwill truck is coming.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: … and whatever is up there in that attic goes
away with it.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Should have it fumigated, too. I saw a fly
today.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Look in the index…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Not really… what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Having difficulty adjusting? Is death a
problem and not a solution? Unhappy with eternity? Troubled by the
living? Call Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist. That’s Betelgeuse, Betel…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That’s it? No number, or instructions?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nothing. The bio-exorcist? I don’t get it…</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What the hell are you trying to do out
there?</p>
<p><strong>little jane</strong>: Are you a boy or a girl?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I only speak to vertebrates.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: What happened to the people who used to live
here?</p>
<p><strong>little jane</strong>: They drowned!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes, they were family. I was devastated. Here,
darling.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Is this the key to the attic?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That’s a skeleton key. It’ll open any door in
that house. Will you give it to your father? And you might mention that
I single-handedly decorated the house. In case he needs advice in that
area. Come see me.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Help! Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Any particular kind?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Joke! Joke! Aspirin!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That little girl saw us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She couldn’t have. We can’t <u>make</u> them
see us.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: But she <u>saw</u> us. I could feel it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s all we need.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ve locked it.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Have the living got you down?
<u>Betelgeuse</u>! Are they jacking you around? <u>Betelgeuse</u>! Have
you broken out in hives ’Cause you’re tired of their jive? I will drive
them from your hive… <u>Betelgeuse</u>!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Say it once… Betelgeuse Say it twice…
Betelgeuse. The third time’s a charm… Betelgeuse! Come on
<u>down</u>!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I was just trying to open the door.
Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Let me have it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: But it doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Skeleton keys never work. Anyway, this can
wait. We’ll get a crowbar later. Where’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Stepmother.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m going down to relax. I want a
noise-free zone. Do you understand? Noise-free.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I’m lonely.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We need some help. I found something this
morning. Here. Emergencies. “In case of emergency, draw door.”</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Draw door? I don’t know why we keep looking
in that stupid book.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You don’t actually think this is going to
work?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in
the afterlife. Why don’t we try this Beetle guy??…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: <u>Aha</u>! Knock <u>three</u> times.</p>
<p><strong>otho-install gas fire logs in</strong>: STUDY.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Darling, can’t you see I’m relaxing in
here!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well I just wanted to tell you what I
saw.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Lydia. What the hell is the point of my
moving up here if you people won’t let me relax? Go help your
mother.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Fine. Maybe you can relax in a haunted house.
But I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Nice building… Bad paint. Good lines… bad
roof. Good parking… hmmm???</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Botco International.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes, I’d like to speak with Maxie Dean.</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: He’s not in right now.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Well tell him that Charles Deetz
called.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: My God what I could do with that
parking.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: … Not what I expected when we walked through
that door.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No. But it’s somewhere without big
worms.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You don’t have an appointment, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: W… We didn’t know how to make one.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: An appointment for what?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We need some help.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Already? You just bit the big one nine
months ago and you want help?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nine months? What difference does that
make?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Good luck. You’re going to use up all
your help vouchers.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Help vouchers?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: D-90’s. You spend a hundred and
twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you
get only three class-one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably
haven’t even read through the manual completely yet.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Why three?</p>
<p><strong>typist</strong>: Rule Number Three. Everything comes in
threes…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You’ll have to wait if you don’t have
an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: How long do we have to wait?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait for who?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: For Juno, your caseworker. Not that it
matters to your type. But there <u>are</u> all these other people here
ahead of you. I’d say 3 hours.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Number 54 million, six hundred one.
Ferndock.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Is this what happens when you die?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: This is what happens when <u>YOU</u>
die. That is what happens when <u>HE</u> dies. That is what happens when
<u>THEY</u> die. It’s highly personal. And I’ll tell you something… if I
knew then what I know now… I wouldn’t have had my little “accident!”</p>
<p><strong>other corpses</strong>: <u>Amen</u>!</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Maitland, party of two! Take your
handbook and go to the sixth door.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We forgot our handbook.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Lydia, Delia needs your help!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Right now, Delia says!</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Out that way, through the typing pool,
down the corridor, sixth door on your left. Sixth door. Two threes.
Airhead.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: How do I look? There’re no mirrors on
this side.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Fine, you look fine.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Thanks. I’ve been feeling a little
flat.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: A hundred twenty-five years! I can’t
believe it. I can’t believe they didn’t <u>tell</u> us.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Adam, look at this.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Adam… what is this?</p>
<p><strong>sinister man</strong>: That’s the lost souls room. A room for
ghosts who have been exorcised. Poor devils. That’s death for the dead.
It’s all in the handbook. Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This is it… the sixth door.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: My God, we’re back home.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Look at this, everything is different down
here. All our furniture is gone.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How long do you suppose we were waiting?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Three months.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I’d nearly given up on you. I was about to
leave. I do have other clients.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Are you Juno, our caseworker?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Yes. I evaluate individual cases and determine
if help is needed, deserved, and available.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We need help. We deserve help.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Are you available?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: No. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We’re very unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: What do you expect? You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We’d like some help in getting rid of the
people who moved in here. Barbara and I worked very hard on this
house.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We probably wouldn’t mind sharing the house
with people who were –</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: – like you used to be?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But <u>these</u> people –</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Things seem pretty quiet here. You should
thank God you didn’t die in Italy. The Deetzes. Okay. Have you been
studying the manual?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We tried.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting
says it all. Get ’em out yourself. It’s your house. Haunted houses don’t
come easy.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We don’t quite get it.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I heard. Tore your face right off! Bad news.
It obviously doesn’t do any good to pull your heads off in front of
people if they can’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We have to start simpler, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Start simply. Do what you know. Use your
talents. Practice. We only help those who help themselves. Just do a
little at a time. And of course, practice, practice, practice. It’s
tricky but – you weren’t murderers by any chance, were you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Pity. Murderers seem to have an easy time of
it. Just look at Amityville. He was one of my boys. Didn’t have to give
that one any lessons. From day one… But I must be off… I’ve got a plane
load of football players crashed in the midwest… they need a lot of
help, just with the basics.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: If… we have trouble. What about the guy in
the flyer? Betelge…</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Don’t say his name, you <u>don’t</u> want his
help.</p>
<p><strong>adam &amp; barbara</strong>: Well… We might…</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: No you don’t! He does not work well with
others.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What do you mean? What’s he do?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I wasn’t going to bring it up – but rather
than have you stumble into it and make <u>another</u> mistake, I’ll tell
you – He was my assistant, but he was a troublemaker… He went out on his
own as a free- lance bio-exorcist – claims to get rid of the living… got
into more trouble – you remember the Chicago Fire…</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: He was demoted to a Grade-6 malevolent spirit.
He’s been imprisoned on that plane ever since… in fact, I believe he’s
been sleezing around your cemetery lately. He can only be brought back
by saying his name three times.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: <u>But</u> I strongly suggest that you remove
the Deetz’s <u>yourself</u>.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do
we…?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: That guy is in our cemetery. Oh, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Look, she’s right. We’ll just start simple,
honey, be tougher. I feel… confident. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Pssstt! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I can’t use this. You should have it. Flies
get so little respect anymore.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Maxie, have I not <u>always</u> made you
money? I think that is the only real question here.</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: Well, Charles – no one has made me money like
you. Until your nerves went, you were a demon. It is just that… Winter
River, Connecticut is, you’ll forgive me, no fucking where. Why would I
invest that kind of money to buy an old building way the hell up
there?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Not a <u>building</u>! That’s the beauty of
it. I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>. These people don’t know the
value of their property!</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of
nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: No, No – C’mon, Max, you know me. I’ve got
plans. You gotta come up here and see, then I’ll tell you about it.</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy here… you
know how it was when you were active.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Just a minute, Maxie. Somebody.</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: No listen… we’ll talk about this visiting
later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Great idea, Maxie! Those Japanese could
<u>run</u> it for us. Listen, think right about it, will you? We’ve
almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I’ll show
you.</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: Yeah yeah, we’ll think on it. Bye ya,
Charles. You relax up there, ya hear?</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: Putz! Inter River? My ass.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Oh, Jesus, Lydia! Is Connecticut so boring
that you have to think up shit like this?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I had Maxie Dean on the phone! Darling,
Dad’s found a way to make some money here while I relax, so scram!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: And your mother is going to kill you when
she sees that you cut holes in her $300 sheets. You provoke her you
know. I mean she can be an unreasonable bitch. But you <u>do</u> provoke
her.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: God, this is so corny. Have we been reduced
to this? Sheets?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Think of them as death shrouds. And the
moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>! Practice, practice,
practice.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Deep breath… and…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Gross! How can he stand that woman? Hey, cut
it out! I’m a child! For God sakes!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I feel really stupid.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s <u>not</u> stupid. We’re ghosts. Do you
want this woman for breakfast for 125 years? Moan louder!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Sick! Sexual perversion! If you’re going to
do weird sexual stuff you ought to stay in your bedroom, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Holy cow! <u>No feet</u>!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: A… Are you the guys who’re hiding out in the
attic?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We’re ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: W… What do you look like under there?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Aren’t you scared?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I’m not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are
<u>sheets</u>. Are you gross under there? Are you “Night of the Living
Dead” under there? Like all bloody veins and pus?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: “Night of the Living Dead?” It’s a movie.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would
have been frightened out of my wits.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You’re not gross. Why were you wearing a
sheet?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We’re practicing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You can actually see us? Without the
sheets?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Is this like a trick question?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Of course I can see you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nobody else can.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I’m wearing contacts… Also I read through the
“Handbook for the Recently Deceased.” It says that live people ignore
the strange and unusual… I, myself, <u>am</u> strange and unusual.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You look like a regular girl to me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You read our book? Could you follow it?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Why are you creeping around Delia’s
bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We were trying to scare your mother.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Stepmother. I’m very sensitive about being
related to reptiles.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You can’t scare her. She’s sleeping with
Prince Valium tonight. I stole the key to your attic, you know.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Maybe we better talk.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I certainly did. I’d finish it too, but… I
don’t get out much.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: And this used to be your house, I bet. Why do
you want to scare everybody?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We want to frighten you away. So that you’ll
move out.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You don’t know the Deetz’s very well, do you?
My father bought this place. He never walks away from equity. Why don’t
<u>you</u> leave?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We can’t. We haven’t left the house since
the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Funeral. God, you guys <u>really are</u>
<u>dead</u>! What was it like? The funeral. Did you cry?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We weren’t there. The handbook says funerals
aren’t for the dead.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: God, if this is true this is <u>amazing</u>!
I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, I don’t know… We don’t get many
visitors.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You know you’re really a pretty girl.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Lydia!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I better go…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Wait… I don’t think it would be a very good
idea if you told your parents that we’re up here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Unless you think it would scare them off.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You tell them that we are desperate horrible
ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Wait a minute, what if this is a dream? Can
you do any tricks to prove I’m not dreaming?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, if you <u>are</u> real ghosts, you
better get another routine, those sheets suck!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Lydia! Lydia! My hands are <u>shredded</u>
from doing the laundry, and now I have to deal with your vandalism!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Lydia, honest to God I’m going to kill you.
I’m having a party tonight. <u>I’m</u> cooking, I can’t get servants. Do
I need angst? No, I certainly do not!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: You owe me three-hundred bucks, Lydia! Don’t
go running to your father, you worm.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Dad. Do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Yes. Except when you creep around in your
mother’s –</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Stepmother’s…</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: … sheets.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well this is… I mean, this is the weirdest
–</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Lydia, I don’t know what it is with you and
these pratical jokes, but –</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No feet.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You <u>don’t</u> believe me. That sheet was
full of ghosts. They live here.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Very clever, Lydia. Now would you please –
I’ll tell you what… I know! You’re bored, right? You take that camera
and your bike and photograph every building in town. Don’t tell anyone
what it’s for… Here, take some cash and go do it. How’s that? You want
to stretch, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Look at the size of these lots…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What is this guy doing?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I can’t believe you are doing this to me!
<u>Ghosts</u>. I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight. Otho
has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic. My agent,
Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for “Art in America.” In
fact, no one here tonight has not been in “Vanity Fair.” Except you.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Don’t you <u>dare</u> talk to others about
me. I’m an <u>artist</u>! The only thing that scares me is being
embarrassed in front of my friends. Do you know how hard it is to get
civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary
word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Lydia’s trying, but they don’t believe
her.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She’s got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This is different. Eventually she’ll take
someone to the attic. And then what? We’ve got to try to contact this
guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Adam!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I didn’t do that one… Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s him. Look… Betelgeuse… Betelgeuse…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Go ahead… third time’s a charm.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: <u>Betelgeuse</u>!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Three times. Powerful number.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Bet… el… geuse. What an awful name. I
thought it was like – you know. The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Where is he? What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Has anything been simple so far? From the look
of the shovel, we dig.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, Adam. I don’t have gloves. My nails
keep getting longer. I’ll break them.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I guess we open it.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Maybe we should knock first?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: All right. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We’re…</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You’re the dead.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Aren’t you dead?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Hell no! I’m rolling. I’m a businessman.
I’m the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beeet</u>el <u>Jooose</u>! <u>Who</u> do
I gotta kill?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You don’t kill anyone.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Just get some people out of our house.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Bio <u>busting</u>. I <u>love</u> it.
Who do I gotta kill? Family – right? Obnoxious, I bet. Mommie, daddy,
piglets.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Just one daughter.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Hey <u>you’ve</u> been on Saturn! I
<u>hate</u> those Sandworms! <u>Yecchhh</u>! I’ve lost a lot of buddies
to Sandworms. So a daughter? She got good legs? God I love a young
leg.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: She’s only fourteen…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: … acts like she’s thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: How does she feel about short old men
with dirty ears?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But… the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our
house.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You Maitlands are the backbone of the
afterlife. So what’s my cut?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Can you scare them off?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Me, scary? You be the judge.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Honey. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Go? What d’ya mean? We need help.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, we don’t. We can work something out
ourselves. We just have to try harder.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Hold on. Let’s not be squeamish, missy.
You rang my bell, you gotta lick the pump. I’m rolling!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Folks, be reasonable here. I’m at your
service. You be the judge. I’m a harmless guy. Try me.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Home. <u>Home</u>. <u>Home</u>!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You fresh corpse creeps! Who do you
think you are?… Walking away from a professional?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Honey, I think that was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I am not going to expose that little girl
to that… pervert down there.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Just a hunch… remember things come in
threes – three times in, three times out… I’m getting the hang of this
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I think we really pissed him off.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t care…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But we let him out.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’ve changed my mind… I feel <u>really</u>
confident. We’re getting better at this stuff. We can scare them off
ourselves – tonight! I’ve got an idea. You’re going to love it… I’m
going to hate it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay. But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Hi ho, hi ho, it’s off to work I go!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Well, darling, you can only have a
hysterectomy once, so why don’t you tell us what you <u>really</u> went
into the hospital for last week? Or dare I ask, is that a nose
“nouveau?”</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Otho, you’ve got to help me get Maxie Dean
up here. I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: He’s a cloven-hooved beast!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: He’s your cousin.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: I am ashamed to say he is. Look, nothing short
of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles. And
Sarah? Forget it. You can’t get her out of Bergdorf’s with plastic
explosives. I just hope it wasn’t yet another of your dreary suicide
attempts. You know what they say about people who who commit suicide. In
the afterlife, they become civil servants.</p>
<p><strong>bernard</strong>: Otho! I didn’t know you were into the
supernatural?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Of course you remember! After my stint with
the living theatre. I was one of New York City’s leading paranormal
researchers until the bottom dropped out of the business in ’72.</p>
<p><strong>beryl</strong>: Paranormal… Is that what they’re calling your
kind now?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Don’t you <u>dare</u>.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I saw some ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me
this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: It wasn’t a joke.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Tried to convince me that this house is
haunted. Kids. Kids. Kids! I love them.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: By ghosts?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: By what else?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: In sheets yet. <u>Designer</u> sheets. They
–</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I propose a toast to our intrepid friends.
Who braved the expressway and fourteen toll booths to visit us. May your
buildings go condo.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Yechhh!</p>
<p><strong>beryl</strong>: Thunderbird wine? My God, Delia, don’t you
even have a Safeway up here?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Joke <u>Joke</u>! Charles get the good wine
and I’ll serve the shrimp. It’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Lydia switched wines. Charles – if you do not
agree <u>right now</u>, to boarding school, you can forget having what
<u>you</u> call sex – ever again in your natural lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Now, Lydia… Favor us about your ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Oh, Delia, lighten up!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: She’s been without therapy up here and I will
not allow her to ruin…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: “If I didn’t care, More than words could
say.”</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: “If my every prayer, did not begin and end
with <u>just</u> your name.”</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: For God’s sake, stop me…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: “I could not be true to you beyond
compare.”</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: “Shoo doo wop. Shoo doo wop.”</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: “If I didn’t care… for you…”</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: “Shoo doo wop. Shoo doo wop.”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s watch ’em scatter.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Any minute now. They’ll all run screaming.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Your Ink Spots were <u>won</u>derful!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And your shrimp was remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: N… No, I just did the Ink Spots.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Who did the?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: It’s me. Lydia.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: They’d like for you to come downstairs. Delia
says you can pick any sheets you want.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense
of humor on the part of these ghosts – that they actually appear in
<u>sheets</u>!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: We’re dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a
very sophisticated pair. We must protect them, treat them with respect.
<u>Nur</u>ture them.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: People will pay big money for this. Right,
Grace?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Charles, I want to know why you didn’t tell
me about this –</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: We were waiting for proof. Lydia’s
photographs…</p>
<p><strong>bernard</strong>: What are you all talking about? We… we just
got a little drunk, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: No matter how drunk you get, <u>you</u>
can<u>not</u> sound like the Ink Spots. Charles, this is <u>it</u>! You
can <u>get</u> Maxie Dean up here now.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: His wife Sarah <u>loves</u> the
<u>supernatural</u>. I did a reading for her just last week. Told her
her jowls would tighten soon. I mean she will make him <u>sprint</u> up
here in his helicopter if you can produce ghosts for her.</p>
<p><strong>beryl</strong>: The “Enquirer” has offered fifty thousand
dollars for absolute proof of life after death. I’ll send them over.</p>
<p><strong>bernard</strong>: I’m Delia’s agent! I’ve lost money for
years on her work. If anything <u>actually</u> happened here, I’ll
handle it, thank you. But not until I see some real proof.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: They don’t want to come down.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I think the reason is they were trying to
scare you, and you didn’t get scared –</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Of <u>course</u> we weren’t scared. Just a
little startled. One of those shrimp dropped down my Kamali.</p>
<p><strong>bernard</strong>: Total collective hallucination.</p>
<p><strong>beryl</strong>: I <u>was</u> a little tipsie.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: This was <u>not</u> a hallucination, people.
This was <u>real</u>, really totally real.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Of course, they <u>were</u> rather
spectacular effects – for Connecticut, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: All presences have a home space. A place where
they live, so to speak. Where do they hide out?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: The attic.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: The attic room is locked –</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: They’re ghosts. They do what they want.</p>
<p><strong>bernard</strong>: Delia, you are a flake. You have always
<u>been</u> a flake. I’m packing up and going back to the tricks of the
city. That I can manage. If you <u>must</u> frighten people, do it with
your sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Wait! I’m going to get to the bottom of this!
Lydia, is this some high-tech trick of yours? I want you to take us up
there tout sweet!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Shhh. They’re in there? God, they live like
animals. <u>This</u> is where they’ve been hiding out?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: All right, you dead people! Come on out, or
we’ll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged
yourself with!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Shhhh. They didn’t commit suicide.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: It doesn’t matter. What matters is I’ve got a
roomful of guests down there, who think I’m a fraud. I am going to teach
you something here Lydia. You’ve <u>got</u> to take the right tone in
things like this, or people – whether they’re dead or alive – people
will walk all <u>over</u> you. Come on out, or I will make death so
miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: So where are they, Lydia?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Answer your mother.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Listen, you guys. These ghosts are really
nice people. I think we scared them off. Let’s just leave them alone.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: It’s the whole damn <u>town</u>.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Look at that <u>detail</u>!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Look at the tiny figures.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Look at all that <u>parking</u>!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Come on. Leave their stuff alone.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: They’re not here, Lydia?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I have <u>never</u> been so embarrassed… They
haven’t gone for good, have they?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Everyone <u>out</u> of there. If they’re in
there somewhere, I don’t want to scare them away. Come on now, stay out
of there. We’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Juno, help! Juno!</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Lydia, I will never forgive you for
embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors. You help us with these
ghosts or you’ll be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I’m sorry already.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Now, let’s get back to business. I I want
to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately. I can make history
here! I’m going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading
supernatural research center… and amusement park.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I cannot believe this.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Delia will cook…</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’ll bring the wine… and the business plan.
And Lydia – you’ll bring the ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I can’t <u>bring</u> the ghosts. They’re not
here!</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: … Otho, could you actually… do something
with them?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Perhaps… if I were properly motivated…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: That’s slavery and murder. You don’t know
them. They’re nice people!</p>
<p><strong>snake</strong>: We’ve come for your daughter, Chuck!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: RRRatt shit!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I hate you! I thought you were my
friends.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, wait!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I hate all of you!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Great choice we’ve got here. We get to spend
the next century either hanging out that window or doing parlor
tricks.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe they’ll leave now. That snake was a
pretty nasty customer.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: He might have hurt somebody.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But he didn’t. We’ve got him where we want
him.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You pansy-assed cretins! How <u>dare</u>
you do that to me. I coulda finished the job!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Why did you stop me?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t like Charles Deetz particularly,
but you could have <u>killed</u> him.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Hey, I’ve been bottled up for six
hundred years. Every dog has his day. This is my town. I need a night to
howl.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This is <u>my</u> town.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You wish! I nearly scored with that
little blonde. I need me a short little queen.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You leave her alone, you horrid little
prick!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Go ahead. Make my millenium!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: This burg got a cathouse? I’m getting
anxious if you know what I mean. Six hundred years and all.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: God, you have got her steaming
now.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse
out of the picture! We’ve got some serious talking to do.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: You people have really screwed up! I received
word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>. And you let
Betelgeuse out and didn’t put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of
the handbook.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Handbook? When…?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: <u>Never trust the living</u>! We
<u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide
incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, we didn’t know –</p>
<p><strong>dumb #1</strong>: Hey, Coach, where’s the men’s room?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I’m <u>not</u> your coach. He survived.</p>
<p><strong>dumb #2</strong>: You don’t need a men’s room. You’re not no
man no more. But Coach, let me get this – What’s our curfew over
here?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I feel like we’ve been at war, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: At least insofar as we have our first
casualty. Me.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Otho’ll know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: What’s he going to do? Viciously rearrange
their environment?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Otho knows just as much about the
supernatural as he knows about interior design.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Let’s hope he knows how to produce those
damn ghosts for Max and Sarah… Because I’ve bought options on property
all over town. I need Max’s financing…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Just don’t tell Lydia.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I think she’s in with them.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I am alone.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I am <u>utterly</u>… alone. You have sealed
my fate with your betrayal. I can no longer stand to be used like a
puppet between two deceitful worlds. By the time you read this, I will
be gone, having jumped off…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: … having <u>plummeted</u> off the Winter
River Bridge. Then you will know that I am no longer a toy in your petty
feuds. Goodbye, Lydia.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Are you here?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Maitland? I’ve come for the last
time? Where are you? Barb…</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: They’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Think small. I’m talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Cookie, they are dead, dead,
deadski.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Of course they’re dead. They’re ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: No, I mean they’ve gone. Decamped.
Split. Vanished.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Where’d they go?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: The happy hunting ground. Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Are you a spirit too?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Sort of. High spirit. Heh heh. Listen,
cookie, I’ve been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years. All I want
is to get out.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I want to get in.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You do? Over here? On <u>my</u>
side?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Well, yes, of course. It’s great over
here. You’ll meet all the greats. James Dean. Sid Vicious…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, it can’t be any worse than my life
here.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: That’s right. They treat you like scum,
I bet?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: I can’t help you from this side, but
here’s how we do it. So <u>simple</u>. Say my name three times. That’s
all. I’ll be all yours. Then I’ll bring you over here in style.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I… I don’t know what your name is.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Minor problem. The rules. I can’t tell
it to you. But.. do you know how to play charades?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Of course you do.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Two words.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: First word.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Three syllables.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: No, dummy. Two.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Your fingers are so small I can’t see them.
First word – two syllables.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I don’t know what that signal means.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: It means look <u>behind</u> you,
bimbo.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Beetle!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Good girrrl!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Second word. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Breakfast? Orange?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Breakfast beetle? Beetle? Beetle fruit? Fruit
bat? Fruit Battle? Volkswagen? Fruit wagon?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Good thing you are a beautiful kid. You
are <u>dumb</u>!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I am <u>not</u>! Beetle… Juice?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>? Yecch!
That’s as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: It’s spelled different, but basically…
Now you said it twice, just one more time. And I’ll be free. And then
<u>you’ll</u> be free.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: God, you’re anatomically correct!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Just <u>say</u> it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You were the snake! Right? I know. It was
you.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You’ve <u>got</u> to say it!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No I don’t. I don’t take orders from
Smurfs.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: How’d you like to be married to… the
King…?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: … <u>Elvis</u>?… You know, ever since he
came over he and I have been just like this. I can arrange it. Just say
my name one more time.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No, No… I need to talk to Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Well, cookie, just say my name. I can
get her. That and <u>so</u> much more…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Who else did you say is over there?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Yes… or no? Do you want the Deetzes out or
in?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What about Betelgeuse?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Forget him. He’ll remain with his whores until
someone calls him. You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.
There are a lot of phony trance mediums. They usually can’t make the
formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook…
he could hurt you. As in – <u>exorcism</u>.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: In plain English – that’s death for the dead.
I don’t care what it takes, just get them out of there <u>now</u>. It’s
not pretty, but – that’s death!</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Wait a minute. Let’s see what you’re going to
do…</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: … to scare her. I want to make sure it’s not
some silly parlor trick.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll do the hard part, hon.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Not bad. Not bad. Now you? Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Okay. You look great! Now go clean house. And
don’t forget the photographs and the damned handbook.</p>
<p><strong>particularly dumb player</strong>: Coach! Coach, I don’t
think we survived the crash!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Adam. I can’t do it. I like that little
girl.</p>
<p><strong>adam/monster</strong>: It’s too late. Sometimes things just
work out this way. We have to, honey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara/monster</strong>: No we don’t. We can rebel or
something. We’ll just stay up there in our room. I’ll read, you can
build on the model. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>adam/monster</strong>: Wait. We can’t, honey. Our house…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I want to be with Lydia!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Okay. Beetle… J…</p>
<p><strong>adam/monster</strong>: No, don’t say it!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You lily-livered bleeding hearts!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m so sorry we frightened you. What were
you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: He… Beetle Jui…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: He said if I let him out he would take me
over to the other side to find you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, Lydia, we’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I want to be dead, too.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No you don’t! No… Lydia… Why?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Life is just… unliveable…</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Lydia, believe me… we know… all the hard
stuff is the same over here. You’re going to be who you are… whether
you’re alive or dead… and over here – it’s… It’s flat… there’s no food,
no colors… you can’t smell the flowers. If we knew then what we know
now… we’d have been more careful…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: … we wouldn’t have had our little
accident.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: So <u>never</u> let Beetlejuice out –
never. Besides… We’re thinking about letting everyone stay… you and your
father and mother can stay too.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Step… mother.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Really. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I really don’t. I’ll go find out.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: – In short, I’ve got options to buy enough
of Main Street to control the city council for a hundred years. And at
the prices I’m talking about, if it all fell apart tomorrow, we just
move out and sell to the Arabs and we still come out… I’ve talked to Ed
Cornwall about a wax museum, here… in Thanksgiving Park… Ed’s the man
who made the talking Jesse Jackson statue. And I’ve got a museum
dedicated to 50 Great Moments in the Paranormal – and parenthetically,
D-Con wants to the right to start an insect zoo here in the old hardware
store. Lydia, did you finally decide to join us?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Honey, I am just finishing the first phase
presentation about our little project here. Then we’ll take a stretch
and invite <u>our</u> friends… to meet <u>your</u> friends.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are they here yet?</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: Yes, Charles, let’s cut the bullcorn. We’re
here to see ghosts. This whole ghost town museum and such like follows a
train, if you’ve got the engine… so let’s see your goddamned engine.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: They’re… not here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Nonsense, every time she says that, the
paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’ve got these pictures, Lydia.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No, really… they said they might come back
and all of us could live in peace if you agreed not to tease them or
make them do silly tricks.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: She’s become a little emotional about all
this. No counseling up here. But we aren’t relying on her. No, we rely
on professionals. We have… Otho.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Are they still here, Otho?</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Are they still here, Otho?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Oh, they’re still here. They’re just not
showing up.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: They’re probably guilty about what they did
to me.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Not these people! They are ruthless!</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: I don’t care from guilt. I just want to
<u>see</u> them.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Otho, can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: It’s tricky, but I think I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Wait a minute! What am I worried about? Otho,
you can’t even change a tire!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: I’ll need something personal of theirs.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You’ll have to go to the Goodwill.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You know, I’ve been thinking. I could teach
Lydia to sew.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Little black party dresses?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Ah, Adam, you don’t know anything about
little girls. She’s just… missed out on some love, that’s all…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Let’s see if she can get my model back.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You can build another one… with her.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Come here, I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: I’m deeply sentimental about… weddings.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Their wedding clothes.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Their wedding clothes.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The “words”.</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: Hands vermillion / start of five bright
cotillion / raven’s dive nightshades promise / spirit’s strive, to the
living / let now the dead… come <u>alive</u>.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Doo wah.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We’ve been given a gift here, honey. A real
live little girl. She likes us a lot. She needs us. Maybe that’s why we
died so young, to keep us from getting so… attached to <u>things</u>.
The house, antiques, your model. Look at us. We didn’t have room for
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What makes you think she likes me?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: As sudden thunder / Pierces the night; As
magic wonder / Mad affright Rives asunder / Man’s delight: Our ghost,
our corpse and we Rise to be.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: Shhhh!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: As flies the lizard / Serpent fell; As goblin
vizard, / At the spell Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell; The buried,
dead, and slain… Rise again.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Barbara! Barbara? Ba…</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: What’s happening to them?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Are they suffering?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: They’re dying.</p>
<p><strong>maxie</strong>: They’re already dead. They can’t feel a
thing.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Where <u>are you</u>? Help us! Please.
Betelgeuse!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: So… You’re ready for me now?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You’ve got to help them.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Can <u>you</u> help <u>me</u>?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: … I will.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Then <u>I’ll</u> help them. For a
price.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: W… What is it?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Your qu…? But you’re…</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: I’m beeyoo-teeful.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: … All right… Betelgeuse…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Betelgeuse…</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: All right, that’s enough. Can you stop this
now?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Otho?</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: It’s too late, Charles. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Welcome to <u>Winter River</u>!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Hel <u>LO</u> Piggies! <u>Welcome to
Winter</u> <u>River</u>! See the Museum of Natural Greed. The Monument
to Bored Businessmen! <u>Come closer</u>!</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: You better not sell, you better not
buy…</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Or old Uncle Beetle Claus will be
makin’… you… fly.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Yowser, yowser. Well, who do we have
here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Let’s have a hand for the
<u>Maitlands</u>, Barbara and Adam. They deserve a rest.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: Well, we’ll get back to them after they
recover from their flight.</p>
<p><strong>betelgeuse</strong>: <u>My God</u>, what <u>ugly</u> wall
dressing. Who is responsible for all this <u>ugliness</u>? <u>Otho, it’s
you</u>! Watch out for the taste patrol!</p>
<p><strong>otho</strong>: No. Noooo! My <u>God</u>. It’s <u>Giorgio</u>
<u>Armani</u>!</p>
<p><strong>giorgio</strong>: Before youa getta started herea, I joost
wanta to saya, Otho, don’ta weara my stuff? Okay? Youa too fat for
human-type clothes. Ita makes my designs looka like aircraft
