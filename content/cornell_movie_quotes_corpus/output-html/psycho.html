<h1 id="psycho">psycho</h1>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Never did eat your lunch, did you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I better get back to the office. These
extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Call your boss and tell him you’re taking the
rest of the afternoon off. It’s Friday anyway… and hot.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you
to the airport?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We could laze around here a while longer.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this
sort aren’t interested in you when you come in, but when your time’s up…
Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve heard of married couples who deliberately
spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: When you’re married you can do a lot of things
deliberately.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You sure talk like a girl who’s been
married.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sorry, Mary. My old Dad used to say ‘when
you can’t change a situation, laugh at it.’ Nothing ridicules a thing
like laughing at it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ve lost my girlish laughter.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The only girlish thing you have lost.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sam. This is the last time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This! Meeting you in secret so we can be…
secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours
and… I wish you wouldn’t even come.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay. What do we do instead, write each other
lurid love letters?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I haven’t time to argue. I’m a working
girl.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And I’m a working man! We’re a regular
working-class tragedy!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It is tragic! Or it will be… if we go on
meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse
for flying down deductible here…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You can’t laugh at it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Can you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sure. It’s like laughing through a broken jaw,
but…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And besides, when you say I make tax-
deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You couldn’t be a criminal if you committed a
major crime.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I wish I were. Not an active criminal but… a
nice guy with the conscience of a criminal. Next best thing to no
conscience at all.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have to go, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I can come down next week.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not even just to see you, to have lunch… in
public?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We can see each other, we can even have
dinner… but respectably, in my house with my mother’s picture on the
mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And after the steak… do we send Sister to the
movies and turn Mama’s picture to the wall?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sam! No!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mary, whenever it’s possible, tax- deductible
or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions. Even
respectability.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You make respectability sound…
disrespectful.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m all for it! It requires patience and
temperance and a lot of sweating- out… otherwise, though, it’s only hard
work. But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this… I won’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m fed up with sweating for people who aren’t
there. I sweat to pay off my father’s debts… and he’s in his grave… I
sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she’s living on the other side of
the world somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A couple of years and the debts will be paid
off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops… and then…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I haven’t even been married once yet!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, but when you do… you’ll swing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sam, let’s go get married.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And live with me in a storeroom behind a
hardware store in Fairvale. We’ll have a lot of laughs. When I send my
ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll lick the stamps.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You know what I’d like? A clear, empty sky… and
a plane, and us in it… and somewhere a private island for sale, where we
can run around without our… shoes on. And the wherewithal to buy what
I’d like. Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself
someone available.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m thinking of it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How can you even think a thing like that!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t miss your plane.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, we can leave together can’t we?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m late… and you have to put your shoes
on.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Isn’t Mr. Lowery back from lunch?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: to-talk voice laced to-with a vague Texan
He’s lunching with the man who’s buying the Harris Street property, you
know, that oil lease man… so that’s why he’s late. Mary does not respond
You getting a headache?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’ll pass. Headaches are like resolutions…
you forget them soon as they stop hurting.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You got aspirins? I have something… not
aspirins, but bottle of pills out my mother’s doctor gave these to me
the day of my wedding. Teddy was furious when he found out I’d taken
tranquilizers!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Were there any calls?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Teddy called. Me… And my mother called to
see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she’s going to
Tucson to do some buying and she’ll be gone the whole weekend and…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls should
get your boss to air-condition you up. He can afford it today.</p>
<p><strong>lowery</strong>: Mary, will you get those copies of the deed
ready for Mr. Cassidy.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Tomorrow’s the day! My sweet little girl…
Not you, my daughter! A baby, and tomorrow she stands up there and gets
her sweet self married away from me! I want you to look at my baby.
Eighteen years old… and she’s never had an unhappy day in any one of
those years!</p>
<p><strong>lowery</strong>: Come on, Tom, my office is air-
conditioned.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: You know what I do with unhappiness? I buy
it off! You unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not inordinately. Cassidy’s too-close</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: I’m buying this house for my baby’s wedding
present. Forty thousand dollars, cash! Now that ain’t buying happiness,
that’s buying off unhappiness! That penniless punk she’s marryin’…
Probably a good kid… it’s just that I hate him. Yup! Forty thousand,
says here… Casharoonie!</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: I never carry more than I can afford to
lose! Count ’em!</p>
<p><strong>lowery</strong>: Tom… cash transactions of this size! Most
irregular…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: So what? It’s my private money! And now
it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I declare!</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: I don’t! That’s how I’m able to keep
it!</p>
<p><strong>lowery</strong>: Suppose we just put this in the safe and
then Monday morning when you’re feeling good…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Speakin’ of feeling good, where’s that
bottle you said you had in your desk… given away Lowery’s Oops! Usually
I can keep my mouth shut!</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Honest. I can keep any private transaction
a secret… any pri…. Lowery! I’m dyin’ of thirstaroonie!</p>
<p><strong>lowery</strong>: I don’t even want it in the office over the
weekend. Put it in the safe deposit box, at the bank, Mary. And we’ll
get him to give us a check on Monday - instead.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: He was flirting with you. I guess he
noticed my wedding ring.</p>
<p><strong>lowery</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don’t mind, I’d
like to go right on home after the bank. I have a slight…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: You go right home! Me and your boss are
going out to get ourselves a little drinkin’ done! Right?</p>
<p><strong>lowery</strong>: Of course. You feeling ill?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A headache.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: You need a week-end in Las Vegas…
playground of the world!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m going to spend this week-end in bed.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy</strong>: Only playground that beats Las Vegas!</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Aren’t you going to take the pills?
They’ll knock that headache out.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t need pills… just sleep.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Hold it there!</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: In quite a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. be awaiting an I didn’t mean to sleep so
long. I was afraid I’d have an accident last night, from sleepiness… so
I decided to pull over…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: You slept here all night?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. As I said, I couldn’t keep my eyes…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should have… I mean, just to be safe…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I didn’t intend to sleep all night! I just
pulled over… have I broken any laws?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: No, m’am.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Then I’m free to go…?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course not! Am I acting as if… something’s
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Frankly, yes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please… I’d like to go…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Is there?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is there what? I’ve told you there’s nothing
wrong… except that I’m in a hurry and you’re taking up my time…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor
off, please.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: In the course of my duty, I never “take
up” anyone’s time, whether it’s to give a warning, or a ticket, or help!
Believe that, M’am. Now if you woke up on the wrong side of… the car
seat, that’s one thing. But when you act as if I’ve just placed you
under arrest…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: No need to apologize…</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: May I see your license?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: With you in a second!</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: I’m in no mood for trouble!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: There’s an old saying, “First customer
of the day is always the most trouble!” But like I said, I’m in no mood
for it so I’m just going to treat you so fair and square you won’t have
one human reason to give me…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Can I trade in my car and take another?</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: You can do anything you’ve a mind to…
and bein’ a woman, you will! That yours?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, it’s… nothing wrong with it, I’m
just…</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: Sick of the sight of it! Well, suppose
you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I’ll
have my mechanic give yours the once over and… want some coffee? I was
just about…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. Thank you. I’m in… a hurry. I just want to
make a change and start…</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: One thing people never ought to be when
they’re buying a used car is in a hurry! But like I said, too nice a day
for arguing. I’ll just shoot this into the garage.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: That’s the one I’d’ve picked for you
myself!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now
I know you don’t know anything about engine condition, but you can feel,
can’t you… and it’s all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one
around the block…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It looks fine. How much will it be, with my
car…?</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: You mean you don’t want the usual day
and a half to think it over? You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin’
you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course not. Please.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: Well… heck, this is the first time I
ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman! I’d figure roughly…
then back at the …your car plus five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: Aha! Always got time to argue money,
huh…?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: I take it… you can prove that car’s
yours… I mean, out of state and all… got your pink slip and your…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I think I have the necessary papers. Is there
a Ladies Room…</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: In the building … Mary starts for the
building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: I think you’d better give it a trial
spin. Don’t want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d really rather not. Please. Can’t we just
settle this and…</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: I’ll be perfectly honest with you,
Ma’am. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But what? Is there anything so terribly wrong
about… making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I’ve stolen…
my car?</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: No, M’am. I was only about to say, I’ve
sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test… that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: ownership papers and I’d like to be ready when
he gets back.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer</strong>: Okay. If you’ll come along…</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Hey! Miss?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Just put it right in here, please… beside
me.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer’s voice</strong>: Heck, Officer, that was the
first time I ever saw the Customer high- pressure the Salesman! Somebody
chasing her?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman’s voice</strong>: I better have a look at those
papers, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>car dealer’s voice</strong>: She look like a wrong-one to
you?</p>
<p><strong>patrolman’s voice</strong>: Acted like one.</p>
<p><strong>caroline’s voice</strong>: Yes, Mr. Lowery.</p>
<p><strong>lowery’s voice</strong>: Caroline…? Mary still isn’t in?</p>
<p><strong>caroline’s voice</strong>: No, Mr. Lowery… but then she’s
always a bit late on Monday mornings.</p>
<p><strong>lowery’s voice</strong>: Buzz me the minute she comes in.</p>
<p><strong>lowery’s voice</strong>: Call her sister! If no one’s
answering at the house….</p>
<p><strong>caroline’s voice</strong>: I called her sister, Mr. Lowery,
where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn’t
know where Mary is any more than we do.</p>
<p><strong>lowery’s voice</strong>: You better run out to the house. She
may be… unable to answer the phone…</p>
<p><strong>caroline’s voice</strong>: Her sister’s going to do that.
She’s as worried as we are.</p>
<p><strong>lowery’s voice</strong>: No! I haven’t the faintest idea. As
I said, I last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday… she
said she didn’t feel well and wanted to leave early and I said she
could. And that was the last I saw… …wait a minute, I did see her, an
hour or so later, driving… Ah, I think you’d better come over here to my
office. Quick. Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.</p>
<p><strong>lowery’s voice</strong>: After all, Cassidy, I told you… all
that cash… I’m not taking the responsibility… Oh, for heaven’s sake, a
girl works for you for ten years, you trust her! All right, yes, you
better come over.</p>
<p><strong>cassidy’s voice</strong>: Well I ain’t about to kiss off
forty thousand dollars! I’ll get it back and if any of it’s missin’ I’ll
replace it with her fine soft flesh! I’ll track her, never you doubt
it!</p>
<p><strong>lowery’s voice</strong>: Hold on, Cassidy… I still can’t
believe… it must be some kind of a mystery… I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>cassidy’s voice</strong>: You checked with the bank, no? They
never laid eyes on her, no? You still trustin’? Hot creepers, she sat
there while I dumped it out… hardly even looked at it, plannin’ and… and
even flirtin’ with me…!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Dirty night.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You have a vacancy?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins,
twelve vacancies. They moved away the highway.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I thought I’d gotten off the main…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I knew you must have. No one stops here
anymore unless they do.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: But it’s no good dwelling on our losses, is
it. We go right ahead lighting signs and following the formalities…
Would you sign, please.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Your home address. Oh, just the town will
do.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: sticking out of her Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Cabin One. It’s closer in case you want
anything… right next to the office.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe,
food.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: There’s a big diner about ten miles on up…
just outside Fairvale.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Am I that close to Fairvale?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Fifteen miles. I’ll get your bags.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Stuffy in here. Well… the mattress is soft
and there’re hangers in the closet and… stationary with “Bates’ Motel”
printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious…
and… the… over there…. bathroom, fairly</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ll be in the office if you want anything…
just tap on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Bates.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Norman Bates.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You have something most girls never
have.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: There’s no name for it… But it’s something
that, that puts a person at ease.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you. Again.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You’re not going to go out again and drive
up to that diner, are you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Then will you do me a favor? Will you have
supper here? I was just about to, myself… nothing more than some
sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I’d like it if you’d come up to the
house and… I don’t set a fancy table but… the kitchen’s awful homey.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d like to.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: All right, you get your dresses hanging out
and… change those wet shoes, and I’ll come for you soon as it’s ready…
…with my trusty umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: No! I tell you no!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I won’t have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper… note creeps into the …by candlelight, I
suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic
minds!</p>
<p><strong>norman’s voice</strong>: Mother, please…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: And then what? After supper, music?
Whispers?</p>
<p><strong>norman’s voice</strong>: Mother, she’s just a stranger…
hungry, and the weather’s bad…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Mother, she’s just a stranger! As if
men don’t desire strangers, as if… oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting
things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Go on, go tell her she’ll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite with my food… or my son! Or do I have to
tell her, cause you don’t have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts,
boy?</p>
<p><strong>norman’s voice</strong>: Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ve caused you some trouble.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Mother… an attempt at sardonic …what is the
phrase… “she isn’t herself today”… I think that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You shouldn’t have bothered. I really don’t
have that much of an appetite.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’m sorry. I wish… people could apologize
for other people.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t worry about it. But as long as you’ve
made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It might be nicer… warmer in the office.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Eating in an office… …to officious, even for
me. I have the parlor behind this… if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Please sit down. On the sofa.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’re very… kind.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It’s all for you. I’m not hungry. Please go
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You eat like a bird.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’d know, of course.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Not really. I hear that expression, that one
eats “like a bird,” is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds
eat a tremendous lot. Oh, I don’t know anything about birds. My hobby is
stuffing things… taxidermy. And I guess I’d just rather stuff birds
because… well, I hate the look of beasts when they’re stuffed, foxes and
chimps and all… some people even stuff dogs and cats… but I can’t… I
think only birds look well stuffed because they’re rather… passive, to
begin with… most of them…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Uncommon, too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I imagine so.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It’s not as expensive as you’d think. Cheap,
really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost
anything.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A man should have a hobby.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It’s more than a hobby… sometimes… a hobby
is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is your time so empty?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh, no! I run the office, tend the cabins
and grounds, do little chores for mother… the ones she allows I might be
capable of doing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You go out… with friends?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Friends? Who needs friends. A boy’s best
friend is his mother. You’ve never had an empty moment in your whole
life. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Only my share.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Where are you going? I don’t mean to
pry…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m looking for a private island.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What are you running away from?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why do you ask that?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No. People never run away from anything. The
rain didn’t last very long. You know what I think? I think we’re all in
our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out.
We scratch and claw… but only at the air, only at each other, and for
all of it, we never budge an inch.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sometimes we deliberately step into those
traps.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I was born in mine. I don’t mind it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You should… mind it.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh I do… but I say I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: shaking her head If anyone ever spoke to me,
the way I heard… The way she spoke to you, I don’t think I could ever
laugh again.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Sometimes when she talks that way to me I’d
like to… curse her out and leave her forever! Or at least, defy her. But
I couldn’t. She’s ill.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She sounded strong…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I mean… ill. She had to raise me all by
herself after my dad died… I was only five… and it must have been a
strain. Oh, she didn’t have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us
with a little something… anyway, a few years ago… Mother met a man. He
talked her into building this motel… We could have talked her into
anything… and when. Well… It was just too much for her when he died,
too… And the way he died… Oh, it’s nothing to talk about when you’re
eating. Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother… she had nothing
left.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Except you.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: A son is a poor substitute for a lover.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why don’t you go away?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: To a private island, like you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, not like me.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It’s too late for me. And besides… who’d
look after her? She’d be alone up there, the fire would go out… damp and
cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don’t do that to them,
even if you hate them. Oh, I don’t hate her. I hate… what she’s become.
I hate… the illness.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Wouldn’t it be better if you put her in…
someplace…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: An Institution? A madhouse? People always
call a madhouse “someplace.” Put her in Someplace!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m sorry… I didn’t mean it to sound
uncaring…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What do you mean about caring? Have you ever
seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes
studying you… and my mother there? Why? has she harmed you? She’s as
harmless as… one of these stuffed birds.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I am sorry. I only felt… it seemed she was
harming you. I meant…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Well? You meant well? People always mean
well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest
so very delicately that…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ve suggested it myself. But I hate to even
think such a thing. She needs me… and it isn’t… childlike pleading …it
isn’t as if she were a maniac, a raving thing… it’s just that… sometimes
she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, and just one time can be enough. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Thank you, Norman.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Norman.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You’re not going to… to your room
already?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m very tired. And I’ll have a long drive
tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Phoenix?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I stepped into a private trap back there – and
I want to go back and… try to pull myself out. Before it’s too late for
me, too.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Why don’t you stay a little while, just for
talking.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d like to, but…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Alright. I’ll see you in the morning. I’ll
bring you breakfast. What time will you…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Very early. Dawn.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Alright, Miss…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Crane.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: That’s it. bothered by not being able to
match the name to the memory of the name in the</p>

<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>summerfield</strong>: You want to see Sam?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam Loomis.</p>
<p><strong>summerfield</strong>: Sam! Lady wants to see you!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: May I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’m Mary’s sister.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Is Mary here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I want to know if my sister is here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: With you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t know where. In your store, somewhere
in your town… anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>woman customer</strong>: All I can do is hope if it isn’t
painless, it’s quick!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What should I know?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. I take it you don’t either? How long?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Last Friday. She left work, and home… I was in
Tucson over the weekend… I haven’t heard from her, not even a phone
call.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And you thought she’d come up here, to me? If
she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: A good reason, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well what do you think, we eloped or something?
Or we’re living in sin and…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Mr. Loomis, you’re so busy being defensive
that you haven’t even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is
missing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I was getting to that!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: What do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nothing! You’re putting me on the
defensive.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Look, if you two are in this thing together, I
don’t care, it’s none of my business… But I want to see Mary. I want her
to tell me she’s all right and it’s none of my business. Then I’ll go
back to Phoenix and…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Bob? Run out and get yourself some lunch.</p>
<p><strong>summerfield</strong>: It’s okay, Sam, I brought it with
me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Run out and eat it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What thing?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What thing could we be in together?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I hate tears.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Is Mary… in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well why didn’t she come to me… call me…?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Not that kind… You men and your egos.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Never mind my ego. Let’s talk about Mary.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Let’s all talk about Mary.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who are you, friend?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator. Where
is she, Miss Crane?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Wouldn’t have been able to tail you if you
did.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s your interest?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Somebody better tell me what’s going on and
tell me fast! I can take so much and then…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Your girl friend stole forty thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Must’ve needed it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you talking about? What is this?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: She was supposed to bank it, on Friday, for
her boss. She didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Someone has seen her. Someone always sees
a girl with forty thousand dollars. She is your girl friend, isn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam, they don’t want to prosecute, they just
want the money back. It was all in cash…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Casharoonie!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam, if she’s here…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She isn’t!</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane?
Nothing more? No phone call… from him, or from your sister herself?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Not even a hunch. Just hope.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: With a little checking, I could get to
believe you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t care if you do or… I want to see Mary…
before she gets in any deeper…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did you check in Phoenix… hospitals… maybe she
had an accident… a hold-up…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen
by her very victims, I might add.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t believe it. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes… I just… did. The moment they told me…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You might have doubted for say five minutes or
so, Sister.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: We’re always quickest to doubt people who
have a record for being honest. I think she’s here, Miss Crane. Where
there’s a boyfriend… She won’t be back there among the nuts and bolts…
but she’ll be in this town… somewhere. I’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I just listened… and believed everything they
told me. ‘She stole the money.’ ‘We don’t want to get her in trouble.’
‘No don’t bring the police in’…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It was her boss’ idea not to report it to the
police?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No. The man whose money she… he talked so loud
and fast, and I… I should’ve called the police.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He must have had a darn good reason for wanting
them kept out of it… All that cash…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I ought to call the police right now!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two
planning to go away with the money?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How could I go away? I’m in debt up to my…
incongruity of his reply, then goes If she did steal that money… It’s
hard to believe she did because it’s hard to see why she would. Unless
she had some wild idea that it would help me… us…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: She haven’t even called you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I didn’t see her… and I didn’t hear from her!
Believe that!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I need to… I need to believe something. This
is the first time I’ve ever come up against anything I couldn’t…
understand.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’ve led a charmed life.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No. I just think… anything can be explained.
But Mary, doing a thing like this… I don’t know how to handle…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Maybe we can handle it together.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I came flying up here expecting to get some
explanation… for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me,
at home. I’d better go home.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think she’ll contact me if she contacts
anybody. Why don’t you stay here. When she shows up… or calls… be
here.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: suspicion of him You want me to stay here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She’ll need both of us.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Where… can I stay?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street.
Come on. the closed-for-lunch After we check you in we’ll go to the
drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we’ll come back here… and
wait.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I always forget to put the sign on, but we
do have vacancy. Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: In the past two days I’ve been to so many
motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked
like it was hiding from the world at large.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t really forget the sign, it just
doesn’t seem… any use. This used to be the main highway. Want to
register, please?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Sit down. I don’t want to trouble you,
just want to ask…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No trouble. Today’s linen day. I change all
the beds once a week, whether they’ve been used or not… dampness. I hate
the smell of dampness. It’s such a dank smell.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You out to buy a motel?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh. I thought… you said you’d been to so
many in two days… What was it you wanted to ask?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: I’m looking for a missing person. wallet

doesn’t Trying to trace a young girl who’s been missing almost a week.
From Phoenix. It’s a private matter… family wants to forgive her… She
isn’t in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I didn’t think the police went searching for
people who weren’t in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: I’m not the police.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: We have reason to believe she came this
way… might have stopped in this area… which Norman doesn’t Did she stop
here?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No. No one has stopped here in weeks…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Mind looking at the picture before
committing yourself?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Committing myself to what? You sure talk
like a Policeman.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Look at the picture. Please.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No. At least I don’t recall.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: She might have used an alias. Mary Crane’s
the real name, but she might’ve registered…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t even bother with guests registering
any more… I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities. Arbogast
is listening I shouldn’t even bother to change the linen. I guess habits
die hard. Which reminds me…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: The vacancy sign. Just in case.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Now there’s a couple even remarking about
your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: You thought no one has stopped here in
weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Maybe she even signed the register…
because habits die hard. Let’s check it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Yes sir! Marie Samuels. Interesting
alias.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Don’t know where she got “Marie,” but
“Samuels” figures. Her boy friend’s name is Sam. Was she in disguise? Or
do you want to check the picture again?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I didn’t lie to you. I just have trouble
keeping track of… time.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It was raining and her hair didn’t look like
that… damped out, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Tell me all about her.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and
she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: How early?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Very early. Dawn.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Of which morning?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: The following morning. Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: No one met her?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Or arrived with her.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: She didn’t call anyone? Even locally?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: You didn’t spend the whole night with her
did you?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No! Of all…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: How do you know she didn’t make a
call?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: She was tired. She said she had a long drive
ahead of her, in the morning… Yes, now I’m remembering very clearly
because I’m picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your
mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she
was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she
had to drive a long way.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Back where?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: You said she was sitting “back there,” or
standing rather…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful
hunger… so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in
the morning. I didn’t even see her leave.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: How did she pay you?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Cash or check? For the cabin…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Cash.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: And when she left, she never came
back.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Why should she? I’m sorry, I have work to
do, Mr… if you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: I do mind. If it don’t jell, it ain’t
aspic! This ain’t jelling.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t know what you expect me to know
about… people come and go…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: She isn’t still here, is she?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Not at all!</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all
twelve… would I need a warrant?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Look, if you won’t believe me, go ahead. You
can help me make beds if you like. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I guess I’ve got one of those faces you
can’t help believing.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: continuing to stare Anyone at home?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I live there. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Someone is sitting in that window.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: My mother.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: She’s… ill. Confined to her room. It’s
practically living alone.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: If this girl Mary Crane were here, you’d
have no reason to hide her would you?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: If she paid you well?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Now, look…!</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Or if she had you say… gallantly
protecting her… you wouldn’t be fooled… you’d know she was just using
you. Wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’m not a fool! And I’m not capable of being
fooled! Not even by women!</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: I didn’t mean that as a slur on your
manhood. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: That’s all right. maybe she could have
fooled me. But… She didn’t fool my mother.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Your mother met her? Can I talk to your
mother?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No. I told you, she’s confined…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Just for a moment. She might have picked
up a hint you’d miss.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won’t
disturb…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: No! Just no! I have one of those breaking
points like any other man, believe it or not, and I’m near it. There’s
just so much pushing I can take and I think…</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: All right! Might save me a lot of leg-work
if I could just talk to your mother. But I’d need a warrant for that,
won’t</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Miss Crane, please. She leave a number?
Thanks. Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast. Lila? Look, this isn’t much,
but it might make you feel a little better. Mary was up here. Spent last
Saturday night at Bates’ Motel, out here on the old highway. Young
fellow runs it, said Mary spent the night, left, period! I did question
him, believe me. I think I got all there was to get. Just have to try to
pick up the scent from here. Well… maybe that’s because I don’t feel
entirely satisfied. He’s got a sick old mother, confined type, and I
think she saw Mary and talked to her. Shame, too… confined old women
love to talk to strangers. I was, but I think I’ll go back to the motel,
first. No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis. I should be back in an hour.
All right. And Lila… You’ll be happy to know what I think. I think our
friend Sam Loomis didn’t even know Mary was here. See you in an hour. Or
less.</p>
<p><strong>arbogast</strong>: Bates!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound.
Ever notice, Lila?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam. He said an hour. Or less.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s been three.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Are we just going to go on sitting here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’ll be back. Let’s sit still and hang on,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hundreds! Which one is your pet?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Whenever I start contemplating the panic
button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks-
out-for-everybody look and… I feel better.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I feel better when you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Where’s the old highway?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast
and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything
Arbogast’s been building for the last three hours.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That wouldn’t be a wise thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Patience doesn’t run in our family. Sam, I’m
going out there!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Arbogast said…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: An hour! Or less!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Got the number of the motel out on the old
highway? Bates, I think.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam! Why call when we can go?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Probably on his way back right now.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam, I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’ll never find it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Why can’t I go out there with you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know… One of us has to be here in case
Arbogast’s on the way.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Just wait here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Contemplate your… panic button.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Arbogast?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He didn’t come back here?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at
home… A sick old lady unable to answer the door… or unwilling.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Where could he have gone?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went
right on…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Without calling me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: In a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam, he called me when he had nothing
definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don’t you think he’d have
called if he had anything…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes. I think he would have.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s go see Al Chambers.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s the Deputy Sheriff around here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Our Deputy sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nothing. Just… all the lights out… must be
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Does that mean we can’t…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. I’m just procrastinating. People hate when
the doorbell rings in the middle of the night. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: You didn’t! It’s tinkerbell. Al wants
to be sure he’ll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.
Well come on in, at least!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Albert! Al Chambers!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Customers!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Let’s go out back and have some coca
while the men are talking.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No, thank you. It’s my problem, too.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know where to start… Except at the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She’s been
here for a few days, looking for her sister. There’s a private detective
helping… and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying
he’d traced Mary…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Mary is Lila’s sister?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the
old highway…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Bates’ Motel. He has a mind like a
mechanical brain and the more information you feed it… Go on, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He traced her there and called us to say he was
going to question Mrs. Bates…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Norman took a wife?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. An old woman, his mother. That was early
this evening. And we haven’t seen or heard from him since. I went out to
the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Will you help us? I think something’s wrong
out there!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now. Your sister is missing how long?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no
trace until…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: How’d you and this detective come to trace
her to Fairvale?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They thought she’d be coming to me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Left Phoenix under her own steam?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: She ain’t missing so much as she’s run
away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: From what?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: She stole some money.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: A lot?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Forty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: And the police haven’t been able to…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Everyone concerned thought… if they could get
her to give back the money… they could avoid involving her with the
police.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Explains the private detective. He traced
her to the Bates place. What’d he exactly say when he called you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Mary had been there, one night, and had
left.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: With the forty thousand dollars?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He didn’t mention the money. What he said on
the phone isn’t important, is it? He was supposed to come back after he
spoke to the mother, and he didn’t! That’s what I want you to do
something about!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Go out there! Find somebody, ask some
questions! I’m sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking…
something’s wrong. I have to know what!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I think something’s wrong, too, Miss. But
not the same thing. I think your private detective is what’s wrong. I
think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going…
probably from Norman Bates… and called you to keep you still while he
took off after her and the money.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He said he was dissatisfied… and was going
back.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Why don’t you call Norman and let him
say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just
scooted off… it’ll make the girl feel better, Albert.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: At this hour?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He was out when I was there. If he’s back he
probably isn’t even in bed yet.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: He wasn’t out when you were there. He just
wasn’t answering the door in the dead of night… like some people do.
This fellow lives like a hermit…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Recluse. Kinder word.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You must remember that bad business out
there. About ten years ago…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve only been here five. Right now it feels
like ten, but…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: All right! Then call! At least, call!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Norman? Sheriff Chambers. Been just fine,
thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out
there tonight… Well, this one wouldn’t be a customer, anyway. A private
detective, name of…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Arbogast.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Arbogast. And after he left? No, it’s okay,
Norman. How’s it been going out there? Well, I think you oughta unload
that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you
know… but…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep.
Yeah, be glad to. Said to give you his regards.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Was that all?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: This detective was out there and Norman
told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: And he didn’t go back? Didn’t see the
mother?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You should’ve called in the police the
second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private
investigations, using people you don’t even know…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: What difference does that…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Your Detective told you a nakedfaced
lie.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Barefaced.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: He told you he wasn’t coming right back
cause he wanted to question Norman Bates’ mother, right?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Norman Bates’ mother has been dead and
buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: It ain’t only local history, Sam, it’s the
only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned
this guy she was… involved with, when she found out he was married, then
took a helping of the same stuff herself. Strychnine. Ugly way to
die.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Norman found them dead together. In
bed.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You mean that old woman I saw sittin’ in the
window wasn’t Norman Bates’ mother?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Maybe you saw Mary!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’d know the difference between Mary and an old
woman.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an
old woman?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded
and called but she… just ignored me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: And you want to tell me you saw Norman
Bates’ mother.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It must’ve been. Arbogast said so, too… and he
said the young man wouldn’t let him see her because she was ill!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well, if the woman up there is Mrs. Bates…
who’s that woman buried out at Greenlawn Cemetery?</p>
<p><strong>mother’s voice</strong>: I am sorry, boy, but you do manage
to look ludicrous when you give me orders!</p>
<p><strong>norman’s voice</strong>: Please, mother…</p>
<p><strong>mother’s voice</strong>: No! I will not hide in the fruit
cellar! Think I’m fruity, huh? I’m staying right here! This is my room
and no one will drag me out of it… least of all my big bold son!</p>
<p><strong>norman’s voice</strong>: They’ll come now, Mother. He came
after the girl and now someone will come after him! How long do you
think you can go on… Mother, please, just for a few days, just so they
won’t find you!</p>
<p><strong>mother’s voice</strong>: Just for a few days… In that dank
fruit cellar? No! You hid me there once, boy, and you won’t do it again!
Not ever again! Now get out! I told you to get out, boy! Norman! What do
you think you’re going to do? Don’t you touch me! Don’t! Norman! All
right, son, put me down and I’ll go. I’ll go on my own two feet. I can
go on my own two feet, can’t I?</p>
<p><strong>norman’s voice</strong>: I’ll carry you, mother.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We thought, if you didn’t mind, we’d go out to
the motel with you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: He’s already been.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Went out before service.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: Have you two had breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You didn’t find anything.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Nothing. Here, let’s clear the path.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Did he say anything about my sister?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Just what he told your detective.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No mother.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You must’ve seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I
know you’re not the seeing- illusion type… But no woman was illusion
there and I don’t believe in ghosts, so there it is!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I still feel…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Can see you do. Sorry I couldn’t make you
feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a
missing person… And the theft, is what you want to do! Sooner you drop
this thing in the lap of the law, that’s the sooner you’ll stand a
chance of your sister bein’ picked up. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. chambers</strong>: It’s Sunday. Come over and do the
reporting at the house, ’round dinner time. Make it nicer. You too,
Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Want me to drop you at the hotel? Or you want
to come over to the store?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I won’t feel satisfied unless I got out there,
Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Neither will I.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I wonder if we’ll ever see Mary again.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Of course we will.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Alive.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We lived together all our lives.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where’d you go to college?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I didn’t. I got a job, too. I wonder if that
hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? Some people are so
willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don’t let
them.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She was willing to lick the stamps.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I wonder so many things about her now. Why she
never told me about you… Funny, when you think there’s an answer to
everything, you think you know all the answers.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We were going to get married. Are going to get
married!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Do you know how I found out about you? I found
one of your letters… it was a nice letter, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is the old highway.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I suppose… when you were able to marry her
she’d have presented you, all shiny and proper… she always tried to be
proper.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Watch your tenses.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She always tries to be proper.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You going to wait here for me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m going with you. But we’d better decide what
we’re going to say and do when we walk in…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We’re going to register. As man and wife. And
get shown to a cabin… and then search every inch of that place, inside
and… outside.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You won’t believe it… But this will be the
first time I’ve ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin
capers!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I believe it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I wonder where Norman Bates does his
hermiting?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain
move.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just coming up to ring for you.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I suppose you want a cabin.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We’d hoped to make it straight to San
Francisco, but we don’t like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day
coming… doesn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ll take you to…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Better sign in first, hasn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: It isn’t necessary.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip… ninety
percent business… and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better
sign in and get a receipt.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ll get your bags.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Haven’t any.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ll show you the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: First time I’ve seen it happen. Check in any
place in this country without bags, and you have to pay in advance.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Ten dollars…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That receipt…?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’ll start ahead.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t bother yourself… we’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We should have asked for Cabin One… The one
Mary was in.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m glad we didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We have to go into that cabin and search it,
Sam… no matter what we’re afraid of finding and no matter how much it
may hurt.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know. Do you think if something happened, it
happened there?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam, if you owned a useless business like this
motel… one you probably couldn’t even sell… what would you need to get
away, to start a new business, somewhere else? Forty thousand
dollars?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How could we prove… Well, if he opens a new
motel on the new highway… say, a year from now…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: There must be some proof that exists right
now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary… Some
way!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What makes you sound so certain?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Arbogast! Sam, he liked me… or felt sorry for
me… and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he
called… in his voice, a caring. He wouldn’t have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us. Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped,
so he must have found out something!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We’ll start with Cabin One.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: If he sees us… we’re just taking the air.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Bates?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Hospital clean.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one
in our cabin is clean… but this is clean!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It didn’t get washed down. It’s figuring… the
kind you tear up and get rid of. Some figure has been added to or
subtracted from… forty thousand.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That’s proof Mary was here! It would be too
wild a coincidence for somebody else to…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Bates never denied Mary was here.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found
out about the money.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do we simply ask him where he’s hidden it?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think
she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same
thing!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You can’t go up there.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Bates.</p>
<p><strong>lila’s voice</strong>: Let’s find him. One of us can keep him
occupied while the other gets to the woman.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: You won’t be able to hold him still if
he doesn’t want to be held. And I don’t like you going into that house
alone, Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila’s voice</strong>: I can handle a sick old woman.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s voice</strong>: All right. I’ll find Bates and keep him
occupied.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Wait a minute. If you get anything out of the
mother… Can you find your way back to town? If you do get anything,
don’t stop to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, matter of fact. The wife’s taking a nap
and… I can never keep quiet enough for her… so I thought I’d look you up
and… talk.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Satisfied with your cabin?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: after a self-conscious I’ve been doing all the
talking so far, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I always thought it was the people who are
alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there
you are, doing all the listening! You are alone here, aren’t you? It
would drive me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: That would be a rather extreme reaction,
wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just an expression… What I meant was… I’d do
just about anything… to get away. Wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lila’s voice</strong>: Mrs. Bates?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m not saying you shouldn’t be contented here,
I’m just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under… you’d unload this place…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: This place! This isn’t ‘a place.’ It’s my
only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My
mother and I… we were more than happy.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And now that your mother’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: My mother is not dead!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You look frightened. Have I been saying
something frightening?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I don’t know what you’ve been saying.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve been talking about your mother… about your
motel. How are you going to do it?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won’t
have to hide your mother!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where will you get the money to do that, Bates…
or do you already have it… socked away… a lot of it…</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: …Forty thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I bet your mother knows where the money is. And
what you did to get it. And I think she’ll tell us.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Where’s that girl? The girl you came with!
Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Mrs. Bates…?</p>
<p><strong>norman’s voice</strong>: Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma
Bates!</p>
<p><strong>television man</strong>: door he has just You think they’ll
take him out that way?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Probably have to. Besides, the taxpayers
hate it when something gets slipped out the back door on them!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s regular. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I could stand something regular.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: You two can go on home if you like. Making
that statement was enough for one night.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Want to?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No. I’m all right. I’ll feel better when all
this is explained… if it can be.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: If anybody gets any answers, it’ll be the
fellow talking to him now… the Psychiatrist. Even I couldn’t reach
Norman… and he knows me. You warm enough, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>district attorney</strong>: Did he talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. I got the whole story… but not from
Norman. I got it from… his mother.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Norman Bates no longer exists. He only
half-existed to begin with… now, the other half has taken over. Probably
for all time.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Did he kill my sister?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes… and no.</p>
<p><strong>district attorney</strong>: Look, if you’re trying to lay a
lot of psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea this fellow would
like to cop…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: A psychiatrist doesn’t lay the groundwork ..
he merely tries to explain it.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: But my sister is…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes. I’m sorry. The Private Investigator,
too. If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel… Have
you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books?</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Yes. Two.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Young girls?</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Did he confess to…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: As I said, the mother… To understand it, as I
understood it hearing it from the mother… That is, from the mother-half
of Norman’s mind, you have to go back ten years… to the time when Norman
murdered his mother and her lover. He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died. His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman… and for years the two of them lived as if there was no
one else in the world. Then she met a man and it seemed to Norman she
“threw him over” for this man. That pushed him over the thin line… and
he killed them both. Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of
all… and most unbearable to the son who commit it. So he had to erase
the crime, at least in his own mind. He stole her corpse… and a weighted
coffin was buried. He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even “treated”
it to keep it as well as it would keep. And that still wasn’t enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse. So he began to think and speak for
her, gave her half his life, so to speak. At times he could be both
personalities, carry on conversations… at other times, the mother-half
took over completely. He was never all Norman, but he was often only
mother. And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed
she was as jealous of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to
any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild. When Norman met
your sister, he was touched by her… and aroused by her. He wanted her.
And this set off his “jealous mother” and… “mother killed the girl.”
After the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep… and like a
dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his
mother had committed.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why was he… dressed like that?</p>
<p><strong>district attorney</strong>: He’s a transvestite!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Not exactly. A man who dresses in woman’s
clothing in order to achieve a sexual change… or satisfaction… is a
transvestite. But in Norman’s case, he was simply doing everything
possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive. And
whenever reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that
illusion, he’d dress up, even to a cheap wig he brought, and he’d walk
about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice… He tried to be
his mother. And now he is. That’s what I meant when I said I got the
story from the mother. She thinks Norman has been taken away… because of
his crimes. She insists she did nothing, that Norman committed all the
murders just to keep her from being discovered. She even smiled a bit
coquettishly as she said that. Of course, she feels badly about it… but
also somewhat relieved to be, as she put it, free of Norman, at last.
When the mind houses two personalities, there is always a battle. In
Norman’s case, the battle is over… and the dominant personality has
won.</p>
<p><strong>chambers</strong>: And the forty thousand dollars? Who got
that?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: The swamp. These were murders of passion, not
profit.</p>
<p><strong>police guard</strong>: He feels a little chill… can I bring
him this blanket?</p>
<p><strong>mother’s voice</strong>: It’s sad… when a mother has to speak
the words that condemn her own son… but I couldn’t allow them to believe
that I would commit murder. They’ll put him away now… as I should have…
years ago. He was always… bad. And in the end, he intended to tell them
I killed those girls… and that man. As if I could do anything except
just sit and stare… like one of his stuffed birds. Well, they know I
