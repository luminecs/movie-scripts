<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A RING WITH DR. EVIL’S INSIGNIA ON IT. THE
RINGED:HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY CAT.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, are we all here? Good. As you
know, my plot to high- jack nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage
has failed. Again. This organization will not tolerate failure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Mustafa…</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Frau Farbissina…</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I spared your lives because I need you to
help me rid the world of the only man who can stop me now. We must go to
London. I’ve set a trap for Austin Powers!</p>
<p><strong>(production note</strong>: ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN
TECHNICOLOR:FREEZE FRAMES A LA SWEET CHARITY.)</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Alright, luv! Love it! Turn… pout for me
baby. Smashing!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Crazy baby. Give me some shoulder. Yes! Yes!
Yes! No. No. Show me love. Yes! And… done. Here you go, luv. I’m
spent.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Get these off to Fab Magazine right
away.</p>
<p><strong>supermodel 1</strong>: Austin, you’ve really outdone yourself
this time.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thanks, baby.</p>
<p><strong>supermodel 2</strong>: We could have another photo session
back at my flat.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, behave!</p>
<p><strong>supermodel 3</strong>: Austin, I love you!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: So many women, so little time.</p>
<p><strong>mod girl 1</strong>: It’s Austin Powers!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Judo chop! Judo chop!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You might want to protest a bit louder next
time, luv.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Kensington.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: Hello, Austin</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: That’ll be Basil Exposition, Chief
of British Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Hello, Austin. This is Basil
Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. You’re Austin Powers,
International Man of Mystery, and you’re with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The
year is 1967, and you’re talking on a picture phone.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: We know all that, Exposition.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: I just wanted to be extremely
clear so that everyone knows what’s going on at any given time. We’ve
just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to
take over the world.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for
good.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: I’m afraid not. Earlier this week,
Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he’s
planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat
Swinger’s Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Just where you’d never think to look for
him. We’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Good luck, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Oh, and Austin…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you. Let’s go, baby!</p>
<p><strong>mick jagger</strong>: Hey Austin Powers, it’s me, Mick
Jagger.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hey, Mick!</p>
<p><strong>mick jagger</strong>: Are you more satisfied now sexually,
Austin?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well, you can’t always get what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>mick jagger</strong>: “You can’t always get what you want!”
That’s a great title for a song! I’m gonna write that, and it’ll be a
big hit.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Good on ya, man.</p>
<p><strong>mick jagger</strong>: Groovy!</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Austin Powers? Hi, I’m Andy Warhol.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hey, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Hungry.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Here, have this can of Campbell’s Tomato
Soup.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I’m going to paint this can of soup and
become famous and not give you any credit for it.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: If you can become famous, everyone will have
their fifteen minutes of fame, man.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: “Fifteen minutes of fame?” I’m going to
use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Smashing!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Austin Powers, Britain owes you a debt of
gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: I understand you were wounded. Where were you
hit?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: In the but-tocks.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: That must be a sight. I’d kind of like to see
that.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Nice buttocks.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: We’ve got to find Dr. Evil!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Wait, I’ve got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: Austin, why in God’s name did you
strike that woman?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That ain’t no woman! It’s a man, man. It’s
one of Dr. Evil’s assassins.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Where’s Doctor Evil?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ve got you again, Dr. Evil!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Not this time. Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! See
you in the future, Mr. Powers!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: My God! He’s freezing himself.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I’ll be back, Mr. Powers, when free love
is dead, and greed and avarice once again rule the world.</p>
<p><strong>graphic</strong>: 1997 - NORAD - COLORADO SPRINGS THIS SCENE
IS SHOT:IN THE MULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN STYLE, LIKE THE THOMAS CROWN
AFFAIR:</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: Commander Gilmour?</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: Commander, this is Slater in SoWest
Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an
unorthodox entry angle.</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Is it one of ours?</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its
metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon-
composite. It does have an odd shape, sir.</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: What are you saying, son?</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: It appears to be in the shape of
Bob’s Big Boy, sir.</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Oh my God, he’s back.</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: In many ways, Bob’s Big Boy never
left, sir. He’s always offered the same high quality meals at
competitive prices.</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: Should we scramble TacHQ for an
intercept?</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: What’s its current position?</p>
<p><strong>radar screen</strong>: It was over Nevada, but… oh my God!
It’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Listen son, I want you to forget
what you saw here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: Commander, I have to log it…</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: That’s a direct order. You didn’t
see a thing!</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Philips.</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Call the President</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Prepare the jet…</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Get my overnight bag.</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Philips, do me a favor and feed
my fish.</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Not too much!</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: I’m going to London, England.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil
had himself frozen in 1967. Soon after, Austin Powers volunteered to
have himself frozen, in the event Dr. Evil should ever return. We
believe Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world. And
that, gentlemen, is why we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>command gilmour</strong>: Outstanding re-cap, Exposition.</p>
<p><strong>borschevsky</strong>: Who is this Austin Powers? Is he a
British operative?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: No, he worked freelance, an
internationally renowned swinging photographer by day and the ultimate
gentlemen spy by night.</p>
<p><strong>female announcer</strong>: Attention, Stage One, laser
cutting beginning.</p>
<p><strong>female announcer</strong>: Laser cutting complete. Stage Two,
warm liquid goo phase beginning.</p>
<p><strong>female announcer</strong>: Warm liquid goo phases complete.
Stage Three, reanimation beginning.</p>
<p><strong>female announcer</strong>: Reanimation complete. Stage Four,
cleansing beginning.</p>
<p><strong>female announcer</strong>: Cleansing complete. Stage Five,
evacuation beginning.</p>
<p><strong>female announcer</strong>: Evacuation com…</p>
<p><strong>female announcer</strong>: Evacuation… Complete! The
cryogenic state of Austin Powers is now completed.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: You’re in the Ministry of Defense.
It’s 1997. You’ve been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: The shouting is a temporary side-
effect of the unfreezing process.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes, I’m having trouble controlling… THE
VOLUME OF MY VOICE!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: You might also experience a slight
fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General
Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: A lot’s happened since you were
frozen, Austin. The cold war’s over.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will
finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: We won, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya! Nice tie. Yea
capitalism!</p>
<p><strong>commander gilmour</strong>: Mr. Powers, the President’s very
concerned. We’ve got a madman on the loose in Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: It’s Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: When do I begin?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Immediately. You’ll be working
with Ms. Kensington.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You mean Mrs. Kensington?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has
long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Vanessa’s one of our top
agents.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My God, Vanessa’s got a smashing body. I bet
she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing
process, I have no inner monologue? I hope I didn’t say that out loud
just now.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to
the Nineties. You know, a lot’s changed since 1967.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well, as long as people are still having
promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while
at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a
consequence-free environment, I’ll be sound as a pound.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: My mother’s told me all about you.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: If it’s a lie, goddamn her. It it’s the
truth, goddamn me. God, I hope that’s witty. How’s your mum?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: My mother’s doing quite well, thank you
very much.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Yes, well…Agent Kensington will
get you set up. She’s very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.
She’s got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world’s
depending on you.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you, Exposition.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Oh, and Austin…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Let’s gather your personal effects, shall
we?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Danger Powers, personal effects.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Actually, my name’s Austin Powers.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: It says here, name Danger Powers.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Danger’s my middle name.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue
crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with
peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks,
purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One
Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: One credit card receipt for Swedish- made
penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m telling you, baby, that’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: One warranty card for Swedish-made penis
enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I don’t even know what this is. This sort of
thing ain’t my bag, baby.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps
and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: OK, OK, man, don’t get heavy, I’ll sign.
Just to get things moving, baby.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to
working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can
address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We’ve
preserved your private jet just as you left it. It’s waiting at Heathrow
Airport.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot
chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I went to Oxford and excelled in several
subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to
travel – see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D.
in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting
career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It’s
very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in
Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field
operative…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why
don’t we go into the back and shag?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ve been frozen for thirty years, man, I
want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My wedding tackle.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My meat and two veg.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be
a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would
appreciate it if you’d concentrate on our mission and give your libido a
rest.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Have you ever made love to a Chigro?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: A Chigro?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You know, a Chigro… part Chinese, part
Negro… Chigro.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: We don’t use the term ‘Negro’ anymore. It’s
considered offensive.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s right. You’re supposed to say
‘colored’ now, right? Here’s the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy
stews!</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Excuse me, did you say
‘stewardess’? We’re called ‘flight attendants’ now, thank you very
much.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, I get it, it’s like ‘I’m not a whore,
I’m a sex worker’, baby.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: My name is Mrs. Wilkenson. There
are a few things we need to discuss. First of all, we’re not wearing
these.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Also, I have some questions about
the itinerary. It says here, ‘4:30 - Dinner, 5:30 - Everyone Gets Naked
and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy’?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Seems pretty straightforward, don’t you
think…listen darling, I think you’re a fabulous bird. Can I get your
telephone number?</p>
<p><strong>flght attendant</strong>: Sure, it’s easy to remember. It’s
777-FILM. We have to prepare the craft for take-off now.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Smashing! When we land I’ll give you a
tinkle on the telling bone.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Brrrr! She must be frigid. There’s two
things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two,
Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! They’re shag-mad, man! Let
me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Do I make you horny?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To
you, am I eros manifest?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I hope this is part of the unfreezing
process.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Listen, Vanessa, I’m a swinger… That’s what
I do, I swing.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me
be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I
will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth
and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race
depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not
have sex with you.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: What’s you point, Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: You’ve got mail!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This
is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence. There’s a company in Las
Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of
the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you’ll be
staying. That’s the first place you should look. Well, I’m off to the
chat rooms.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you, Exposition.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Oh, and Austin…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, we’re beginning our
final descent into Las Vegas International Airport. Flight attendants
will be coming by to collect your drinks, and I’ll ask you at this time
to please return to the main cabin and put your bean- bags in the
upright position.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s been a long
time, but I’m back. It’s all gone perfectly to plan except for one small
flaw. Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen. I was
therefore by definition only partially frozen.</p>
<p><strong>angle on evil associate mustafa. he is terrified and
sweaty,</strong>: EYES DARTING LEFT AND RIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: But my design was perfect! Your autonomic
functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn’t frozen, the
aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than
the left.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Can’t you see I’m only half a man? Look at
me, I’m a freak!</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is– –work
with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months
of that and it’ll be just as strong as the other arm…</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: And look what you’ve done to
Mr. Bigglesworth!</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: We could not anticipate feline
complications due to the reanimation process&amp;emdash;</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Silence!</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: Ahhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Let this be a reminder to you all that
this organization will not tolerate failure.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE IS IN HIS
EARLY:FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS SCAR ON HIS CHEEK.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: We’ve got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: Someone help me! I’m still alive, only I’m
very badly burned.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Some of you I know, some of you I’m
meeting for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an
ambulance? I’m in quite a lot of pain.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: You’ve all been gathered here to form my
Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: If somebody can open the retrieval hatch
down here, I could get out. See, I designed this device myself and…oh,
hi! Good, I’m glad you found me. Listen, I’m very badly burned, so if
you could just–</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: Ow! You shot me!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. Okay. Moving on.</p>
<p><strong>mustafa</strong>: You shot me right in the arm! Why did–</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Let me go around the table and introduce
everyone. Frau Farbissina…</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: …founder of the militant wing of the
Salvation Army. Random Task…</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: …a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman
extraordinaire. Show them what you do.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Thank you, Random Task. Patty O’Brien…</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: …ex-Irish assassin. His trademark?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: A superstitious man, he leaves a tiny
keepsake on every victim he kills. Scotland Yard would love to get their
hands on that piece of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>patty o’brien</strong>: Yes, they’re always after me lucky
charms!</p>
<p><strong>patty o’brien</strong>: What? What? Why does everyone always
laugh when I say that? They are after me lucky charms.</p>
<p><strong>patty o’brien</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: It’s a television commercial with
this little cartoon Leprechaun who is a benevolent imp who is very
concerned that these children will steal his lucky charms which are
foodstuffs fashioned into various shapes– hearts, moons, clovers, what
have you… It’s a long story.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Finally, I come to my number two man. His
name: Number Two.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: For thirty years, Number Two has run
Virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Over the last thirty years, Virtucon has
grown by leaps and bounds. About fifteen years ago, we changed from
volatile chemicals to the communication industry. We own cable companies
in thirty-eight states.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: In addition to our cable holdings, we
own a steel mill in Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Shipping in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Oil refineries in Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: And a factory in Chicago that makes
miniature models of factories.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: We also own the Franklin mint, which
makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates,
like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as
two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is
some risk involved.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, I have a plan. It’s called
blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in
the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of
money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne,
has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to
divorce.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an
affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: People have to tell me these things. I’ve
been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here. OK, no problem.
Here’s my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing
machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a
“laser.” Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer
around the Earth, which we scientists call the “Ozone Layer.” Slowly but
surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin
cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Umm, that also has already happened.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. Oh, hell, let’s just do what we
always do. Let’s hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.
Gentlemen, it’s come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic
called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the
United Nations in a few days. Here’s the plan. We get the warhead, and
we hold the world ransom… …FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Don’t you think we should ask for more
than a million dollars? A million dollars isn’t that much money these
days.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: All right then… …FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Virtucon alone makes over nine billion
dollars a year.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Oh, really? One-hundred billion dollars.
OK, make it happen. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Remember when we froze your semen,
you said that if it looked like you weren’t coming back to try and make
you a son so that a part of you would live forever?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Well, after a few years, we got
sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: My son?</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Yes. Scott!</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Hello, Scott. I’m your father, Dr. Evil. I
have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! Someday, Scott, this
will all be yours.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: I haven’t seen you my whole life and now
you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You’ve preserved my Jag! Smashing!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Yes, we’ve had it retrofitted with a secure
cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous
Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the
toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the
detonation device.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: No, actually. I don’t know how to put this
really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of
dentistry.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Why? What’s wrong with my teeth?</p>
<p><strong>ausitn</strong>: Which side of the bed do you want?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You’re going to sleep on the sofa. I’d like
to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we’re sharing a room is
to support our cover story that we’re a married couple on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag
later? How do you like to do it? Do you like to wash up first? Top and
tails? A whore’s bath? Personally, before I’m on the job, I like to give
my undercarriage a bit of a how’s-your-father.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m just joking, Vanessa. Trying to get a
rise out of you.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Let’s unpack.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Gor blimey, nerd alert.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hey, who put this in here? Someone’s playing
a prank on me! Honestly, this isn’t mine.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I think I’ll give that stew a ding-a-
ling.</p>
<p><strong>movie phone voice</strong>: Hello! And welcome to
777-FILM!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I got her answering machine.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Here, use mine.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m going to use a cover name. It’s
important that it be a generic name so that we don’t draw attention to
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Do you mind if I join you?</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Hit me.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: You have seventeen, sir. The book says not
to, sir.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: I like to live dangerously.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Four. Twenty-one.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Eighteen. Sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I can’t see a bloody thing.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh, I forgot to tell you, they’re
prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Sir, the table is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Uh, hit me.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: On an eighteen, sir?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes, I also like to live dangerously.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: You’re very brave.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Cards are not my bag, man. Allow myself to
introduce… myself. My name is Ritchie Cunningham.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: This is my wife, Enid.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: My name is Number Two.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Number Two? That’s an unusual name.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: My parents were hippies. This is my
Italian confidential secretary.</p>
<p><strong>italian woman</strong>: My name is Alotta Alotta Fagina.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m just not getting it. It
sounds like you’re saying your name is a lot of… never mind. Listen,
cats, I’m going to crash. It’s been a gas.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Bye-bye, Mr… Cunningham?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Peace, baby.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Why did you leave so soon?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I
get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but
first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.</p>
<p><strong>texan</strong>: Good luck, buddy. You don’t buy food, you
rent it.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Too right, youth.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Uh, uh!</p>
<p><strong>texan</strong>: Hey pardner, just relax, don’t force it! Use
some creative visualization.</p>
<p><strong>patty o’brien</strong>: Ughhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Who does Number Two work for?</p>
<p><strong>texan</strong>: That’s right! Show that turd who’s boss!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Who does Number Two work for?</p>
<p><strong>patty o’brien</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>texan</strong>: Jesus Christ, what did you eat?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Hello Mum?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the
flight?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: How’s Austin?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: He’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: You didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the
couch.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: I’m proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: Because you managed to resist
Austin Power’s charms.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Well, God knows he tried, but I’ve been
rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn’t tell me he was so obsessed with
sex. It’s bizarre.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: You can’t judge him by modern
standards. He’s very much a product of his times. In my day he could
have any woman he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What about his teeth?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: You have to understand, in Britain
in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It
didn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I just don’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: Just wait. Once Austin gets you in
his charms, it’s impossible to get out.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Did you ever…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: Of course not. I was married to
your father.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Did you ever want to?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: Austin is very charming, very
debonair. He’s handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines,
sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want
to be him. He’s a lover of love– every bit an International Man of
Mystery.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You didn’t answer my question, Mum.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: I know. Let me just say this:
Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone
with?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Do you want to talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: No, it’s been too long. Best to
leave things alone.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’m on with a friend! Look, I’d better go.
I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kensington</strong>: I love you, Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on
clean underwear.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: We’ve got a doctor’s appointment– an evil
doctor’s appointment.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: A limousine has just pulled up.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, hello. That’s Dr. Evil’s cat.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I never forget a pussy… cat.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Let’s go get him!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: He’s too well-protected right now.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: We can’t just sit here, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Let me tell you a story. There’s these two
bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below.
The young bull says, ‘hey, why don’t we run down the hill and shag us a
cow?’, and the wise old bull replies, ‘no, why don’t we walk down the
hill and shag all the cows?’</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well, you know… cows, and shagging.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Unfortunately, while you told that stupid
story, Dr. Evil has escaped.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No worries, luv. We’ll just give Basil a
tinkle on the telling bone…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly
beautiful. Stay right where you are.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I hate having my picture taken.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You’re crazy. The camera loves you,
Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Go, Vanessa, go!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Alright, luv! Love it! Turn… pout for me
Vanessa. Smashing! Crazy. Give me some shoulder. Yes! Yes! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Show me love. Yes! Smashing!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Great! Great! Smashing! Yes! Yes! Yes! No!
No!</p>
<p>****: Going in very close now.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Give me eyes. Give me cornea. Give me
aqueous humour. Coming in closer. Give me retina, Vanessa. Even closer.
Give me optic nerve. Love it! And… done.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m spent. What say you we go out on the
town?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Fancy a nibble?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I couldn’t have another bite.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Watch out, you’re on my hair!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you
go. Gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Go! Just go!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Left hand, blue.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Wait a tick, I forgot something in the
lobby. I know what. I’ll take the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Maybe I’ll take the escalator.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Why take the escalator when I could take a
canoe?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I haven’t had fun like that since
college.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m sorry that bug up your ass had to
die.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Always wanting to have fun, that’s you in a
nutshell.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, this is me in a nutshell.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Help! I’m in a nutshell! What kind of nut
has such a big nutshell? How did I get into this bloody great big
nutshell?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You’re smashed, Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I am not.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, yes you are.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’m not. I’m the sensible one. I’m always
the designated driver.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I can’t. You’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: It’s not that I’m drunk, I’m just beginning
to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in
the Sixties? I’m dying to know.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: She was very groovy. She was so in love with
your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved
your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But,
unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Hello, Austin, this is Basil
Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link
between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in
something called Project Vulcan. I’ll need you and Vanessa to get on
that immediately.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Right away, Exposition.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Where is Vanessa, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: She’s working on another lead right now.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Then you’ll have to go it alone.
Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you, Basil.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Oh, and Austin…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Let me remind you that because of
the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of
extreme relaxation.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, yes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: There’s one more thing,
Austin.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Paging Dr. Freud.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Give it to me baby. Super.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Pout for me, luv. Smashing. Yes! Yes! Yes!
No! No!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: And I’m spent.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You seem surprised to see me.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: I thought you’d quit while you were
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: What, and watch all my earnings go… Down the
toilet?</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: What do you want, Mr… Cunningham, was
it?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you
Alotta… Please?</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: You may.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Your boss, Number Two, I understand that
cat’s involved in big underground drills.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Virtucon’s main interest is in cable
television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes.
How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I didn’t, baby, you just told me.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: It’s for the mining industry,
Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip
into something more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Behave!</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’d rather talk about Number Two.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Don’t you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come
in, and I’ll show you everything you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: May I wash you?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Groovy.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: In Japan, men come first and women come
second.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Or sometimes not at all.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Care for some saki?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sak-i it to me!</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Mmmm… I feel extreme relaxation.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: ‘Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it
was my food. It just popped up to say hello, and now it’s gone back down
below.’</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: That’s very clever. Do you know any other
poems?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: ‘Milk, milk, lemonade. Round the corner
fudge is made. Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie
roll!’</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Thank you, that’s beautiful. To your
health.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: To my health.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Do you mind if I ask you a personal
question?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Is it about my teeth?</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Damn. What exactly do you do at
Virtucon?</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: I’ll tell you all in due time, after we make
love. But first, tell me another poem.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I think it was Wordsworth who penned this
little gem: ‘Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate
choo-choo train.’</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Oh, you’re very clever. Let’s make love, you
silly, hairy little man.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Austin Powers is getting too close. He
must be neutralized. Any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Ya wohl– I mean, yes wohl, Herr
Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers.
Bring on the Fembots!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Breathtaking, Frau. These automated
strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: These are the latest word in
android replicant technology. Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can
resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Quite impressive.</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Thank you, Herr Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I like to see girls of that caliber. By
caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality
of their character… Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: That would be the video feed from
Kreplachistan.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, Phase One is complete. The
warhead is ours. Let Phase Two begin! Patch us through to the United
Nations security secret meeting room.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: In a little while, you’ll find out that
the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing. Well, it’s in safe hands.
If you want it back, you’ll have to pay me… ONE MILLION DOLLARS!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Sorry. ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!</p>
<p><strong>united nations secretaty</strong>: Gentlemen, silence! Now,
Mr. Evil–</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Doctor Evil! I didn’t spend six years in
evil medical school to be called ‘mister’.</p>
<p><strong>united nations secretary</strong>: Excuse me. Dr. Evil, it is
the policy of the United Nations not to negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Fine, have it your way. Gentlemen, you
have five days to come up with one hundred billion dollars. If you fail
to do so, we’ll set off the warhead and destroy the world.</p>
<p><strong>united nations secretary</strong>: You can’t destroy the
world with a single warhead.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Really? So long.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now,
we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer. Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p><strong>evil associates</strong>: Ha-ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil &amp; associates</strong>: HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! Ohhhh, ahhhhhh… Ohhh, hmmmm. hmn.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Okay… Well… I think I’m going to watch
some TV.</p>
<p><strong>evil associates</strong>: Okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, Exposition.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you
up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from
Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion
dollars. If the world doesn’t pay up in four days, he’s threatening to
destroy the world.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you, Exposition. Only two things,
scare me, and one is nuclear war.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: What’s the other?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: What’s the other thing you’re
scared of?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Carnies.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell
like cabbage.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Indeed… If we could get back to
the business at hand. It’s one thing to have a warhead, it’s quite
another thing to have the missiles to launch it.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Maybe these photographs are the last piece
of that puzzle. I’ve uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It’s a new
subterranean warhead delivery system.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Good God, and underground missile.
We’ve long feared such a development.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: When did you find that out, Austin?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin did some reconnaissance
work at Alotta Fagina’s penthouse last night.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>basil expositon</strong>: Our next move is to infiltrate
Virtucon. Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their
facilities every hour. I suggest we pose as tourists and do site-level
reconnaissance.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Top drawer, Kensington. Oh,
Austin, I want you to meet somebody.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin, this is my mother,
Mrs. Exposition. She’s in from Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Can you believe,
she’s ninety-two years old?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: My God, Austin, what have you
done?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s not your mother, that’s a man!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. exposition</strong>: Owww…my hair!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Get away from my mother!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, have you gone mad?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. exposition</strong>: Who is that man? Why did he hit
me?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposiion</strong>: Don’t worry, mother. Lie down.
Austin, you have a lot of explaining to do.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m sorry, Basil, I thought she was a
man.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Damn it, man! You’re talking about
my mother!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You must admit, she is rather mannish. No
offense, but if that’s a woman, it looks like she’s been beaten with an
ugly stick.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Really, Austin!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Look at her hands, baby! Those are
carpenter’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: All right, Austin, I think you
should go.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I think if everyone were honest, they’d
confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: I’m leaving! Oh, and Austin?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes, Basil?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, may I have a word with you?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Of course, luv.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Listen, I know I’m just being neurotic, but
I can’t shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary,
Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don’t want to sound paranoid, but I’ve had some
bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went
to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these
insecurities, but I can’t help but feel this weird, irrational,
unfocused… well, jealousy. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Don’t be sorry. You’re right to be
suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I can’t believe you made love to her just
like that. Did you use protection?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Of course, I had my nine-millimeter
automatic.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: No, did you use a condom?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Only sailors use condoms, man.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Not in the Nineties.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well they should, filthy beggars, they go
from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Well, it means something to me. If you want
us to have a relationship, you’ve got to be a one-woman man.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: It was just a shag, Vanessa. You’re
everything to me.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You just don’t get it, do you, Austin? Good
night. Welcome to the Nineties, you’re going to be very lonely.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, luv.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Thirty years of political and social
upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of
England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human
strum und drang.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yeah, I can’t believe Liberace was gay.
Women loved him, man. I didn’t see that one coming.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Basil was very concerned to know where you
were last night.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Out and about, doing odds and sods.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’ll tell him. By the way, I’ve decided we
should keep our relationship strictly professional.</p>
<p><strong>son 1</strong>: I love you, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dad 1</strong>: I love you, Son.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank
you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his
father, Mr…. Ehville?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Hello, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: So, Scott, why don’t we start with you.
Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Well, it’s kind of weird.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: We don’t judge here.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for
the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years.
I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take
over the family business.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: And how do you feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: I don’t wanna take over the family
business.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: But Scott, who’s going to take over the
world when I die?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: What do you want to do, Scott?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: I don’t know. I was thinking, maybe I’d
be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: An evil vet?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo
or something.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: An evil petting zoo?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: You always do that! Anyways, this is
really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: We don’t label people here, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: No, he’s really evil.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Scott.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No, the boy’s right. I really am evil.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re
here, that’s what’s important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with
one step.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: I just think, like, he hates me. I
really think he wants to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: OK, Scott, no one really wants to “kill”
anyone here. They say it, but they don’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Actually, the boy’s quite astute. I am
trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so
here he is, unfortunately, alive.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: We’ve heard from Scott, now let’s hear
from you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: The details of my life are quite
inconsequential.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: That’s not true, Doctor. Please, tell us
about your childhood.</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Yes, of course. Go ahead, etc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Very well, where should I begin? My father
was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with
low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a
fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My
father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims,
like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts
of being lazy. A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess
and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon,
luge lessons. In the spring we’d make meat helmets. If I was insolent, I
was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard,
really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of
fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.
There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum. At the age of eighteen, I
went off to evil medical school. From there…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Since I’ve been unfrozen, I’ve had a rancid
taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Do you think she’s prettier than I?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You know who.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No! Don’t lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa.
You’re being very trippy.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’m looking at you, and the whole time I
can’t help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.</p>
<p><strong>austtin</strong>: Well put. Listen love, we can’t keep having
this fight. I’m an International Man of Mystery. Sometimes in the course
of my work to save the world I have to shag some crumpet. It’s all part
of the job.</p>

<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Coming up on the left, we have the
Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide range of Virtucon licensed products.
On the right, you’ll notice a door that leads to a restricted area. Only
authorized personnel are allowed beyond that point.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ll take him, you take her.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, we don’t look anything like our
photo badges.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Don’t worry, baby. I picked up a mind
control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru,
the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease
that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. Just watch me. Watch me,
now.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hi, folks. You’re entering a restricted zone.
Can I see your security badges?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>angle on austin. we push in slowly as austin
concentrates,</strong>: RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE OTHER, BACK AND
FORTH.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Everything seems to be in order.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey, wait a minute–</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Everything seems to be in order.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: That’s amazing. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hold on one second.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Here, have a piece of gum.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Here, have a piece of gum.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Don’t mind if I do.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey! Wait a minute, that’s my last piece of
gum.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, no, I want you to have it, even if it’s
my last piece.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No, no, I want you to have it, even if it’s
my last piece.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m going to go across the street and get
you some sherbert.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, we have to go!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m going to go across the street and get you
some sherbert.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: This is the strongest, sharpest drill bit
ever produced by man. It weighs fifteen metric tones and can bore
through a mile-thick bedrock of solid granite in seven seconds.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Attention, there are intruders in the
complex.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Get them!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Judo chop! Judo chop!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Our only way out of here is to drive
out!</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: There they are!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hang on! I’m going to floor it!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Noooooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Where did you learn to shoot?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Where did you learn to drive?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Noooooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, watch out!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Where? Where?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Noooooooooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Thank God, Austin, we made it.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes, act naturally and we’ll split this
scene the way we came in, Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>middle aged lady</strong>: Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.
Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin. Yes, that’s right, he’s a henchman
in Dr. Evil’s Private Army. What? Killed? How? Run over by a
steamroller? Oh my God. Thank you for calling.</p>
<p><strong>fourteen-year-old</strong>: Hi Mom! When’s Steve coming home?
He said he was going to teach me to play ball.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. harwin</strong>: Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news.
As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil’s Private
Army.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Was? What is it, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. harwin</strong>: Your brother was run over by a
steamroller.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: A steamroller? No, not Steve! Since Dad died,
Steve’s been like a father to me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. harwin</strong>: I’m sorry son. People never think how
things affect the family of the henchman. I love you, Billy. I wonder if
we’ll be able to receive Steve’s henchman’s comp.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Welcome to my underground lair,
Mr. Powers. Mrs. Kensington’s daughter, how lovely. I believe your name
is Vanessa? I’d shake your hands, except for obvious reasons.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: My hand, dammit! Look at it!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: What’s wrong with your hand?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Don’t try to suck up to me! It’s a little
late for that. I’m a freak! Look at it, it’s been rendered useless.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m sorry, baby, I’m just not grocking your
head space.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the
international stage, Mr. Powers, I’m sure you’ll enjoy watching the
curtain fall on the third and final act.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Does that make you horny?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Not now, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: The world’s most powerful subterranean
drill.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: So powerful it can penetrate the Earth’s
crust, delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead into the planet’s hot
liquid core. Upon detonation, every volcano on the planet will
erupt.</p>
<p><strong>american un representative</strong>: Why should we pay him
the money? He’s only got one warhead and he’s going to detonate it deep
underground.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: My God, man, don’t you understand?
It won’t just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well.
Seven-eighths of the Earth’s land mass will be deluged with hot magma.
Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes. Imagine no
United Kingdom. Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted
crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of
Stonehenge. Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic
majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this
England…</p>
<p><strong>british un representative</strong>: Any word from Powers?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: I’m afraid we’ve lost contact with
him.</p>
<p><strong>british un representative</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>united nations secretary</strong>: Dr. Evil, it seems we have
no choice but to pay your ransom.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, your deadline is in three
hours. You have your instructions. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Come join us for dinner, won’t you
Mr. Powers?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I think you’ll enjoy the food. I have the
best chef in the world. His name is Ezekial. He’s made of seventy-five
percent plastic.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Scott my boy, come here. How was your
day?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Well, me and a buddy went to the video
arcade in town and, like, they don’t speak English right, and so my
buddy gets into a fight, and he goes ‘hey, quit hassling me cause I
don’t speak French or whatever’, and the other guy goes something in
Paris talk, and I go ‘um, just back off’ and he goes ‘get out’ and I go
‘make me’.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Fascinating. What are your plans for this
evening?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Thought I’d stay in. There’s a good
tittie movie on Skinemax.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: And that’s how you want to live your life,
is it?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Yeah. What?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Scott, I want you to meet Daddy’s nemesis,
Austin Powers.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Why are you feeding him? Why don’t you
just kill him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: In due time.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: But what if he escapes? Why don’t you
just shoot him? What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I have a better idea. I’m going to put him
in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and
exotic death.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Why don’t you just shoot him now? Here,
I’ll get a gun. We’ll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: One more peep out of you and you’re
grounded. Let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine
are joining us for dinner. They’re quite delighted you’ll be part of the
meal.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to
pay?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even
after they pay me the money, I’m still going to melt all the cities of
the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily
Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Release the sharks! All the sharks have
had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature
deserves a warm meal.</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Dr. Evil?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Yes, what is it? You’re interrupting my
moment of triumph.</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: It’s about the sharks. Since you
were frozen, they’ve been placed on the Endangered Species List. We
tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. Mr. Powers, we’re going to lower
you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: What is it now?</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Well, we experimented with lasers,
but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually
outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the
bottom and died.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I have one simple request– sharks with
friggin’ laser beams attached to their heads, and it can’t be done?
Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Sea bass.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: They’re mutated sea bass.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Really? Are they ill-tempered?</p>
<p><strong>frau farbissina</strong>: Please allow me to demonstrate.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea
bass it is. Come, let’s return to dinner. Close the tank.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Aren’t you going to watch them? They’ll
get away!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No, we’ll leave them alone and not
actually witness them dying, and we’ll just assume it all went to
plan.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: I have a gun in my room. Give me five
seconds, I’ll come back and blow their brains out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No, Scott. You just don’t get it, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What’s your plan?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan
to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on
me just in case.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You
have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol
and still have bad teeth. It didn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: No, no, no. We’ll use the floss to get to
the ledge.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Smashing idea! Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Judo chop!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: My eyes! My eyes!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hold on, Vanessa!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, watch out!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Not a good time to lose one’s head.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s not the way to get ahead in life.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: It’s a shame he wasn’t more headstrong.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: I can’t believe John Smith is getting married
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>guy 2</strong>: Where is Smittie anyways? It’s not like him
to be late for anything, especially his own stag party.</p>
<p><strong>guy 3</strong>: Well, you know he’s a henchman for Dr. Evil.
Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a
little sappy? I think it’s a testament to our friend John that so many
of his buddies showed up in his honor. There’s a lot of love in this
room.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Hi, I have a phone call here for the John
Smith party.</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: Hello? Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
That’s right, he’s in Dr. Evil’s private army. What? He’s dead?
Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass? Oh my God! OK, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>guy 2</strong>: Hey Bill, what’s wrong? Was that John? Is he
coming late?</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: Guys, John’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>guy 2</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: He was decapitated by mutated flying sea
bass.</p>
<p><strong>guys</strong>: Oh no, oh my God, etc.</p>
<p><strong>guy 1</strong>: All right, to Smittie!</p>
<p><strong>guys</strong>: To Smittie!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: We’ve got a freaked out square and world
annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I’m gonna stay here and keep
an eye on the bad Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’m not going anywhere. We’re a team.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Too right, youth. That’s why I need you to
lead the troops.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’ll hurry back.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just
want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had
a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don’t know what happened. The
whole time I was shagging her– I mean really shagging her, I mean it was
crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!–</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, what’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Anyways, what I’m trying to say is that if
you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that’s just groovy, because… I
love you.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh, behave!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Come, everyone, let us repair to the main
chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Don’t you want to see what Daddy does for
a living?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Blow me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, hello.</p>
<p><strong>fembot</strong>: Hello, Mr. Powers, care to have a little
fun?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, actually, I have to save the world.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Is it cold in here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Arm the probe!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ve got to get Dr. Evil! Margaret Thatcher
naked on a cold day! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day! Margaret
Thatcher naked on a cold day!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Probe in place.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Five minutes to go. Let the penetration
countdown begin.</p>
<p><strong>eastern european technician</strong>: Five minutes and
COUN-ting.</p>
<p><strong>fembot</strong>: You can’t resist us, Mr. Powers. Eventually
you’ll give in.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Au contraire, I think you can’t resist
me.</p>
<p><strong>ausitn</strong>: Oh, I fell over.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: It’s not what it looks like, Vanessa. At
ease, boys.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came
out of her…well, and then they… and I…</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I believe you, Austin. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Activate the blast shutters!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Launch the subterranean probe!</p>
<p><strong>eastern european technician</strong>: We have penetration.
Subterranean detonation– two minutes and COUN- ting.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Follow me! We’re going to have to jump over
the rail!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Don’t worry!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Blast! Out of ammo.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin, I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m going it alone this time, Vanessa. I
have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I’ll secure the perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!</p>
<p><strong>destructacon</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I’m the
Destructacon 5000. I’m programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond
this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds
of survival are 23,763,273 to…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a
head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.</p>
<p><strong>destructacon</strong>: Yes, I am programmed to answer any
question.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Really? Let me ask you this. What is
love?</p>
<p><strong>destructacon</strong>: That does not compute.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Why not? It’s a question.</p>
<p><strong>destructacon</strong>: Love is… love is… love is…</p>
<p><strong>destructacon</strong>: Remjack! Remjack! Daisy, Daisy…
Remjackremjackremjack!</p>
<p><strong>eastern european man</strong>: Subterranean detonation– one
minute and COUN-ting.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Where’s the abort button?</p>
<p><strong>eastern european mean</strong>: Forty-five seconds and
COUN-ting. It’s right over there.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Ow! That really hurt. I’m going to have a
lump there, you idiot! Who throws a shoe? You fight like a woman.</p>
<p><strong>eastern european man</strong>: Fifteen seconds and
COUN-ting.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Care for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Shocking.</p>
<p><strong>eastern european man</strong>: Three… two… one…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Nooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>eastern european man</strong>: Abort.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ve got you, Dr. Evil!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Well done, Mr. Powers. We’re not so
different, you and I. It’s true, you’re British, and I’m Belgian. You
have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You’re thin, I’m
about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I’m not making a
very good point. However, isn’t it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very
things you stand for– swinging, free love, parties, distrust of
authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be… evil? Maybe
we have more in common than you care to admit.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, man, what we swingers were rebelling
against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world
domination. We were innocent, man. If we’d known the consequences of our
sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit
would have remained the same. It’s freedom, man.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Your freedom has cause more pain and
suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom
failed.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s why right now is a very groovy time,
man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Really, there’s nothing more pathetic than
an aging hipster.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: Not so fast.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Well, it seems the tables have turned,
Mr. Powers.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: It seems the tables have turned again,
Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Not really. Kill the little bastard. See
what I care.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Man, you are one chilly square!</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: Dad, we just made a breakthrough in
group!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I had the group liquidated, you little
shit. They were insolent.</p>
<p><strong>scott evil</strong>: I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was
never artificially created in a lab.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Scott, don’t say that…</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: This is for sleeping with my man, you
whore!</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: I didn’t sleep with him.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>alotta</strong>: It’s the teeth.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: OK, I believe you. But you still must be
chopped.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Judo chop!</p>
<p><strong>eastern european man</strong>: Five minutes to self-destruct
and COUN-ting.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Let’s split!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I have something to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Lay it on me.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I love you, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s fab, because I love you, too,
Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Behave!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Just when things were getting
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Well, Austin, you’ve stopped
Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe,
and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from
his evil lair.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’d say that about sums it up,
Exposition.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I
have something for you.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Because of your exemplary service
to Her Majesty, you are now officially an active Field Agent with all
the privileges and responsibilities thereof.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Thank you, Exposition. I’m honored.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin, I have something for you
as well.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Here’s the number of my dentist,
he’s first rate. Ring him up, he’ll look after you.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren’t so
bad after all.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin, now, about your next
mission–</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: But, wait, I– you got me again.
Oh, and Austin–</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes Basil?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Be careful!</p>
