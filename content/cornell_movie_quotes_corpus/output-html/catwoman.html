<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>second draft polish</strong>: February 11, 2003</p>
<p><strong>int. temple of bast - night</strong>: START ON THE FACE of A
GOLDEN CAT STATUE. This is the cat- god BAST, lithe, noble, beautiful.
CAMERA MOVES to reveal the statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this
space. Other images of CATS – hieroglyphics, ceramics – abound, as do –
REAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps cut into
the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple. At Bast’s feet, EIGHT
ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi- circle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some
of the women WEEP, others PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside,
we now hear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There’s a RHYTHMIC
BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. temple of bast - night</strong>: THE TEMPLE is an
impressive place of worship – tapered columns and an ornate Egyptian
facade – at the apex of a hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a
PERSIAN ARMY.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: “496 b.c.”</strong>: WHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a
mounted BATTERING RAM swings into the ornate DOORS of the temple.
PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again
and again.</p>
<p><strong>int. temple of bast - night</strong>: The HIGH PRIESTESS
wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that mostly conceals her face. She
moves from one ACOLYTE to the next, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled
decanter into golden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her
goblet toward BAST, as do the others – they drink in unison.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: THE MAU lets out a CRY… which prompts an
eerie, growing CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS. THE CATS
emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from niches, converging
on the bodies. The MAU leads the way, moves to the high priestess and
puts its mouth to hers… ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and
swing open. THE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They
grab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else. At the foot of
BAST lie nine ROBES… but there’s no sign of the women who wore them.
SOLDIERS slash the robes with their swords anyway, then snatch up the
goblets for booty. An unearthly CRY – half-human, half-feline – from
somewhere high above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking around
frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls, from all directions.
The SOLDIERS raise their weapons, clustering defensively. From out of
the shadows above them, DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with
impossible agility. STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively.
The torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the statue’s
golden surface… FLAILING SWORDS, the swift SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN.
We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of the soldiers, clearly outmatched in this
mortal combat. MOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking
downward as they pace the temple’s ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU
takes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks through a
crevice at the roof, and emerges on –</p>
<p><strong>ext. edna’s neighborhood - day</strong>: THE MAU settles by a
SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a present-day suburban street, a busy
main drag. MARSHLAND and WATER are visible not far away, light RAIN
FALLS.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: “2500 years later.”</strong>: The MAU watches
as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from the curb to reveal a WOMAN
in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO – the outfit recalls the high priestess of
Bast. The HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35,
attractive but inclined to conceal her looks – hair over her face, baggy
clothes under her poncho. She’s cautious, eager to please, to do what’s
expected of her – a bit of a doormat. Patience looks up from an address
scribbled on a scrap of paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof –
almost as if she’d sensed its presence. She smiles. THE MAU holds her
gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>ext. edna’s home - day</strong>: An eccentric, ramshackle
home amongst neat, well-kept houses. PATIENCE moves to the front door,
RINGS. As she waits, she notes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT
SCULPTURES on the shingles. A SIGN by the door: “FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY.”
EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She’s 50-70, a former academic,
intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Hi, Edna Powers? I’m Patience Price, I
called about adopting a cat? I saw your flyer at my vet’s office –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Oh yes, do come inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - living room - day</strong>: PATIENCE, out
of her poncho, fills out a questionnaire on a clipboard. Numerous CATS
roam the premises. Feline artwork and curios, scratching posts, furry
toys… cat paradise.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: … Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You may call me Edna.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Edna. Some of these questions are… kind of
personal. Do you really need to know how many, um, partners I’ve had in
the past year?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: I’m not interested in your love life. But I do
want to know what sort of home environment you’re offering, your degree
of commitment…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Guess I wouldn’t need the cat if…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: The application is mostly a formality. I have
a sense about people.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Well, I’ve always liked animals. Cats
specifically. I mean, I love them… worship them, even.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Son of a –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Nothing… handsome cat. I’ve never seen one
like him.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Her. That’s Midnight, an Egyptian Mau.
Normally she doesn’t trust people –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: See? Even I can’t get near her… Very strange.
So. You left out your parents’ address.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Well… they’re both dead.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: No hereditary illnesses, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Private plane crash. I was eleven.
Actually, the last thing they gave me was a kitten… Fatso.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: He was very round – not from overfeeding
or anything, just – really, he didn’t mind. Anyway, he was with me a
long time, till early this year. He didn’t come at the sound of the
can-opener, which kind of freaked me out… I found him just, curled up
there in his little bed…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PATIENCE is getting a bit emotional.
EDNA reaches across and squeezes her hand, with genuine sympathy.
MIDNIGHT snuggles into Patience’s lap, PURRING as she strokes the
cat.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: It’s very hard, dear, I know… you must be in
so much pain.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Funny how cats get under our skin. They do
exactly as they please, they don’t care what anyone thinks about them…
they’re the ultimate predators. So self-contained, so independent, so
wild… sometimes I wonder, why do they even put up with us?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: The free food?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Well, congratulations. It seems you’ve been
chosen.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: So you think you might have a kitten for
me…?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Kitten? No, that wouldn’t be appropriate.
Midnight has chosen you.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: It’s a great honor. Maus are a very rare
breed, descended from the sacred cats of ancient Egypt. They were
believed to have magical gifts.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MIDNIGHT has wrapped herself around
Patience’s arm, kicking and biting “playfully.”</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I’m not sure she likes me –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Nonsense, she perceives something very special
in you.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: There’s nothing special about me.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Cats see things we don’t. Our secret selves –
our souls.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Mm. Do you have any Band-Aids?</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - night</strong>: CAMERA MOVES
THROUGH this modest, neat studio apartment, PAST a BULLETIN BOARD with
numerous PHOTOS. One or two show a YOUNG PATIENCE, there’s a picture of
a LITTLE GIRL between TWO SMILING PARENTS on a ROLLER COASTER. Mostly,
though, they’re snapshots of a chubby TABBY CAT, from kitten hood to old
age. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT LUNGES INTO FRAME, attacking a picture of FATSO,
ripping it from the bulletin board. KEEP MOVING PAST WINDOWS facing on
the street and an adjacent BUILDING across an alley – it’s a corner
apartment on the second floor. CAMERA HOLDS ON A TV, where a classic OLD
MOVIE like Now, Voyager plays. At a key, romantic moment,</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: You know who you are. You know what you’re
after.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: You know you’re too good for any man…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Laurel raises an eyebrow haughtily and
SLAPS his face. She moves past the male model to – – GEORGES AVENAL.
He’s Laurel’s husband and the company C.E.O., handsome and charismatic.
LAUREL falls into his arms. He caresses her, deeply in love. Georges
WINKS.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: … almost.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Beaunique by Avenal. You know you want
it.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No – this is mine!</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh, gross, you – just take it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LONE checks his mail, loosens his tie,
unbuttons his shirt.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Welcome home, sweetie. How was work
today…? Same old same old. All I wanna do is get out of this shirt and
give you a big old hug…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Down in front… Come on, you, off with the
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - bathroom - night</strong>: THE
BATHROOM WINDOW faces into Lone’s bedroom. He starts to unbutton his
shirt, glances casually out the window – PATIENCE immediately ducks out
of sight. A moment later, she rises slowly to peek out again – THE
WINDOW is DARK, LONE has turned off THE LIGHT. PATIENCE flips ON THE
LIGHT, studies her face in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Lame, lame, lame.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - showroom - day</strong>: MOVING CAMERA
delivers an assault on the senses: MIRRORS, oversized versions of the
BEAUTY PRODUCTS, charts of COLOR CHOICES, shelves upon shelves of
slickly-packaged COSMETICS. Prominent is a DISPLAY for BEAUNIQUE. HIP
MUSIC in BG. AVENAL GIRLS, perfectly coiffed and made-up Barbie dolls,
busily paint the faces of CLIENTS, women of all ages and backgrounds, in
high-tech MAKE-UP CHAIRS that resemble torture devices. PATIENCE crosses
through, pausing to take off her sneakers and pull on a pair of high
heels. SALLY – an Avenal girl in a prim outfit, working on a matronly
CUSTOMER – looks up to greet PATIENCE. We now see Patience has a small
SCRATCH on her cheek, poorly covered with makeup.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Look what the cat dragged in.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I know, I know, I’m late – Midnight
thought there was a mouse in my pillow.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: This is why I only sleep with my own species.
Lunch at Joey’s?</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - accounting bullpen - day</strong>: OVERHEAD
ANGLE on a rat’s maze of office cubicles, peopled with ACCOUNTING STAFF.
FIND PATIENCE tapping at her terminal, sipping COFFEE. It’s a grim
little space, enlivened by a GARFIELD toy, some New Yorker cartoons.
PATIENCE seems bored by the drone work – then she cocks her head at
something on the screen, leans closer. She double- checks DATA in the
print-outs. Something doesn’t tally. ON SCREEN – among a long list of
figures, we see “YP-3” highlighted, followed by a series of numbers.
PATIENCE gets up quickly with the printouts, she spills a few drops of
COFFEE on her white blouse. She dabs at these distractedly as she moves
through the bullpen toward a glassed-in office. She knocks on the open
door, where we see the name “D. BERGER - ACCOUNTING.”</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Dave, I was just going over the first
quarter expenses. Our lab fees for this one additive – YP-3 – have gone
through the roof.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Look at this, an overage of eight hundred
percent on “extruded pellets” alone – I’m not even sure what that is
–</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Rat chow.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - day</strong>: – CAMERA SWINGS UP the
40-story skyscraper in the business district of a city mixing
architecture old and new. CAMERA PASSES a WINDOW WASHER on a
cable-driven rig. NEARING the ROOF, we see a glowing sign which reads
“AVENAL BEAUTY” – and a PASSENGER CHOPPER coming in for a landing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - helipad - day</strong>: THE CHOPPER touches
down on a HELIPAD atop an elevated PENTHOUSE. GEORGES AVENAL emerges,
ducking in the blade wash. The company’s CEO, Georges is charismatic,
handsome, immaculately tailored – an exacting asshole to the core.
Getting out of the helicopter behind him, his menacing, silent bodyguard
ANGEL carries a leather suitcase or two. LAUREL AVENAL trots toward her
husband with open arms. Laurel is 30-something, a still-gorgeous
super-model but, in person, a tad past her prime. She comes across as
sweet and well-meaning, but a bit dim and victimized.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh honey, welcome back!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: My allergies. I thought you were getting
rid of that vile dog of yours.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Georges, when you’re gone, Tippy is all I’ve
got and – I get so lonely.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: So get a bird or a fish, something that
doesn’t shed. Have you gained weight?</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - penthouse - day</strong>: LAUREL protests,
examining her body.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: No no, it’s muscle – I’ve been working out,
doing my Tae Kwan Do –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: What the hell happened here?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I’m doing some redecorating, I’ve had so
much time on my hands – do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: No. What’s with the curtains?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Draperies. They soften the space…</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I like hard spaces. Whatever, Laurel, if it
makes you happy. I plan to be spending more time at the factory,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - elevator bank - day</strong>: A LARGE
GRAPHIC depicts LAUREL and GEORGE together. PATIENCE curls her lip at
this as she presses the DOWN button. DOORS OPEN to reveal the real
LAUREL and GEORGES, startling Patience a bit, the impassive ANGEL behind
them. Patience takes a half-step forward and hesitates, reluctant to get
aboard, frozen in place. The DOORS start to close, then open again –
she’s in the way.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: In or out?</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - elevator - day</strong>: GEORGES leans past
her to hit “DOOR CLOSE.” Many CAT HAIRS are sprinkled on her clothes, he
SNIFFS and stifles a sneeze. He looks Patience over, and doesn’t like
what he sees.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Excuse me, miss. Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Um… of course. You’re Georges Avenal – you
own the company –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Then you actually work for me. Are you
familiar with our products?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Yes sir, I just can’t really afford them
–</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: You can afford some peroxide, can’t you? Do
something about this mousy hair.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Stain on your blouse, run in your pantyhose
– and that color’s awful on you. Do you own an iron? Show me your
hands.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: A nail-biter… my my, you really are the
“before” picture, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I could give her the number for my
manicurist –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Patience…</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I haven’t got all day –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No, my name’s Patience, Patience Price.
I’m in accounting.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I’m afraid that’s no excuse. Regardless of
your position, you do represent Avenal Beauty. I simply can’t allow that
to continue.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Wait. You’re not – firing me?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I have no choice. All we have to sell is an
image – and you are not it. You’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Poor girl.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Is that a pimple?</p>
<p><strong>int. joey’s diner - day</strong>: A retro place, PATIENCE and
SALLY sit in a booth over SALADS and SODAS. Sally leans across the
table, fixing Patience’s make-up – her mascara’s run from crying, her
nose is red. An open MAKE-UP POUCH rests between them.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I try, Sally, I really do. I read Vogue, I
wear uncomfortable shoes… I’ve been a female all my life, you’d think
I’d be better at it by now.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Watch the frown lines, you’ll need a lift
before you’re forty.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: He’s right, I’m not even presentable
enough to be an accountant. Maybe the church needs a new bell-
ringer.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Look, he was just in a bad mood. Sales are
down, his marriage is on the rocks –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I have an enquiring mind. This is “Nympho,”
very hot, I snagged it from the showroom…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Laurel’s losing her looks, she’s dumber than
her cockapoo – buzz is, Georges is trading her in for next year’s model.
All I’m saying is, by now he’s probably forgotten about canning you.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I don’t care. No way am I going back
there.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Shut up, you’ll smear… voila, now suck your
finger.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I can’t believe we put this stuff on our
mouths. Grease, acid and ground-up fish scales… who knows what they put
in our mascara…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No wonder you never made it in sales.</p>
<p><strong>int. limousine - day</strong>: LAUREL is fixing her make-up
meticulously in a COMPACT MIRROR, looking for signs of the dreaded zit.
GEORGES is flipping through AD LAYOUT BOARDS. WESLEY, a weasely
ASSISTANT, is seated between them, going over an electronic appointment
book. A CHAUFFEUR, ANGEL in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You’re both scheduled to appear at the
Make-Overs for the Homeless event on the 25th –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Ugh. That one’s yours, Laurel.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: The ballet opens the following Friday –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: These look good, Wesley, send them back to
the agency.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: May I see?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: You wouldn’t be interested.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Please, Georges?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: That’s Drina.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: She’s… pretty.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: She’s magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Well, I’m still the face of Avenal… aren’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: You’ve had a remarkably long shelf life,
it’s true. But… every product has an expiration date.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Uh, sir, it’s Dave Berger in accounting.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Who? I don’t talk to bean-counters.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: He says it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: All right, Angel, put it on speaker.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - berger’s office - day</strong>: BERGER peers
at his TERMINAL, a half-eaten SANDWICH nearby. He’s marked up the
PRINT-OUTS that Patience brought him.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Mr. Avenal – I hate to bother you, sir, but
we have a problem. It seems the lab has been overproducing YP-3 – that’s
the anti-aging ingredient in Beaunique –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Why are you telling me this? It’s routine
to have a surplus –</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: We’ve stockpiled over a thousand gallons,
enough to last us well into the 29th Century.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Perhaps that is a trifle optimistic –</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: And very expensive. Funding seems to have
been siphoned out of the employee pension plan –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Impossible, this has to be an error. Are
you responsible for this data?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Well, actually Patience Price brought the
matter to my attention –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Yes, yes, I’m familiar with Ms. Price.
Obviously her bookkeeping is as sloppy as her appearance.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Sir, she’s a very reliable employee –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I’ve heard enough, Berger. In the future,
double- check your figures before you waste my time – and then put it in
a memo.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: In all fairness, Mr. Avenal, I think –</p>
<p><strong>ext. shopping district - day</strong>: START on a JEWELRY
DISPLAY, a ritzy DIAMOND NECKLACE. SALLY’s face appears in the window,
beaming.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Wow… sorry, Patience, I just found a new best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I’m sick of drooling over things I’ll
never have.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh, you’re a ray of sunshine. Tell you what,
let me take you clubbing this weekend –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I’m not sure I’m fit to be seen in
public.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You will be in that dress. I’ve had my eye on
it for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Sally, that is not a dress, it’s a rumor
of a dress. It’s barely forensic evidence of a dress.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s a genuine Gaultier knock-off –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: But don’t you ever wanna be somebody
else?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I just wish I could be ten years old again
– it didn’t matter what I wore as long as I could climb a tree in
it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Your tomboy days are over.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: That’s my bus, Sal, see you later.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: This weekend, Patience. I swear, I’m gonna
make you have fun if it kills you…</p>
<p><strong>ext. berger’s townhouse - night</strong>: DAVE BERGER, the
accountant, dressed casually, gets out of a CAB and heads into his
modest home.</p>
<p><strong>int. berger’s townhouse - night</strong>: Berger SNIFFS the
air quizzically as he lets himself in. He moves toward the KITCHEN. In
the kitchen DOORWAY, he fumbles for a LIGHT SWITCH, flicks it on and
–</p>
<p><strong>ext. berger’s townhouse - night</strong>: KA-BOOM! The
WINDOWS BLOW OUT with a HUGE EXPLOSION. ACROSS THE STREET, a BLACK
MERCEDES pulls from the curb, HEADLIGHTS OFF, and ACCELERATES away.</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s building - hallway - night</strong>: PATIENCE
moves to her apartment door, arms loaded with GROCERIES. She struggles
to unlock the door while keeping these upright – we see a “HELLO KITTY”
emblem on her key chain. As soon as the door is open – – MIDNIGHT BOLTS
out into the hall, a black streak moving toward the stairs and darting
upward.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Midnight! You little monster –</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s building - upstairs hallway - night</strong>:
MIDNIGHT makes for an open hall window that leads onto a FIRE ESCAPE.
Patience just spots her heading outside.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - alley - night</strong>: Patience
reaches the window just in time to see – MIDNIGHT make a SPECTACULAR
LEAP across the alleyway and –</p>
<p><strong>– land on tom lone’s balcony.</strong>: PATIENCE is annoyed,
but also impressed, in spite of herself.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Hell of a jump…</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - night</strong>: ANGEL flings open
the closet and bathroom doors in Patience’s empty apartment – no dice.
On his way out, he eyes a plate of cat food and ice cream with a
wince.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lone’s building - alley - night</strong>: Patience
clumsily CLAMBERS up Lone’s RATTLING FIRE ESCAPE, reaches the level
Midnight is on, moves toward the cat.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: You are not worth the trouble –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - night</strong>: ANGEL emerges,
shaking his head and shrugging toward the unseen driver of the BLACK
MERCEDES, then he climbs in the passenger door. As the car pulls away –
– LONE hurries from the building next-door toward the alley.</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - alley - night</strong>: PATIENCE
painfully gets upright, slipping in the trash, as LONE appears; he’s a
no-nonsense, gruff cop with a dry wit.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I’m really sorry – I’m a police officer, I
heard the noise and just assumed… here, grab my arm.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Habla espanol?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She blinks at him, confused, then he
tentatively flashes a few HAND SIGNS for the deaf. She waves this
off.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No, I – see, my cat got out –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I live right up there –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I mean, I – I’ve seen you. Around.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Really. Actually, I’ve seen you too.
Around, that is. Thanks for helping me out.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Don’t mention it. I can’t resist a damsel in
distress.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh God, what – what is that?!</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I could run it over to the lab…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I’m sorry, it was nice talking to you, but
– I’m completely disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Mortified, she hurries back to the
entrance to her building. Lone looks after her, amused.</p>
<p><strong>ext. trendy club - night</strong>: SPOTLIGHTS before a
NIGHTCLUB, a CROWD behind a VELVET ROPE. A HANDSOME BOUNCER stands
guard. SALLY AND PATIENCE are near the front of the line. Sally has
transformed herself, with heavy make-up, a revealing skin-tight outfit
that shows plenty of cleavage. Patience is in a conservative dress, one
she might wear to work. Sally HOWLS with LAUGHTER at something Patience
has just said. Patience looks grim.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It isn’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yes it is. All this time you’ve spent mooning
over that hottie neighbor and he points a gun at you –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: At least it broke the ice –</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I told you men go for trashy women.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Speaking of which – how do you even stay
in that outfit?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: With any luck, I won’t need to.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I hardly recognize you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That’s the idea. I go out at night, I leave
daytime Sally behind, become a different person. All women do. Except
you, of course.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: How long have we been here, an hour? We’re
never getting in…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: You could say I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Okay, you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: God, people are so rude.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: She’s with me.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Then you can stay out here too.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: She happens to be a very fine human being
–</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: Like I said, she don’t belong inside.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Sally, just – go in without me –</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: See, you shoulda bought the dress.</p>
<p><strong>int. bus - night</strong>: PATIENCE sits alone in the back of
the bus, looks at – A YOUNG COUPLE making out… an ELDERLY COUPLE holding
hands. Her eyes drift to an AD for AVENAL BEAUTY overhead – LAUREL and
GEORGES AVENAL, arms around each other. Patience sighs and stares out
the window.</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - night</strong>: PATIENCE walks
toward her building, the bus kiosk behind her, the BUS MOVING AWAY. The
street is deserted at this hour. Patience feels very alone, until she
looks up to see – – MIDNIGHT, perched in her window, awaiting her
arrival. A smile appears on Patience’s face. She quickens her step,
crossing the empty street, almost to the sidewalk when – – AN ENGINE
ROARS behind her. Patience spins just as – – THE MERCEDES, LIGHTS OFF,
barrels out of the darkness and</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - night</strong>: MIDNIGHT is
bouncing off the walls, HOWLING like mad, lunging and scratching at the
door. Finally, the cat charges across the floor, LAUNCHES herself in a
dramatic leap and –</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - night</strong>: SLOW MOTION as
MIDNIGHT LAUNCHES HERSELF AT THE GLASS –</p>
<p><strong>ext. bridge/city skyline - night</strong>: SPLASH! A BODY
hits DARK WATER hard and vanishes below. MOVE UP TO REVEAL we’re at a
bridge over a river, CITY LIGHTS in the distance. ON THE ROADWAY, CAR
DOORS CLOSE and the MERCEDES SEDAN SCREECHES away. CLOSER ON THE
SKYLINE. A HOWL rises – FIND MIDNIGHT, CRYING from a rooftop. Unseen
CATS join in, a feline TELEGRAPH.</p>
<p><strong>ext. edna’s home - night</strong>: The CAT CRY, just audible,
far off. Then – a CAT squeezes out a WINDOW at the gap in the sill… more
CATS SCRAMBLE out dormers… yet MORE SHOOT OUT the flapping CAT DOOR.</p>
<p><strong>ext. suburban streets - night</strong>: EDNA’S CATS scramble
through alleyways, joined by STRAYS converging from all directions,
picking up the CHORUS. It’s like a flowing RIVER OF CATS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. marshland - night</strong>: ON MURKY MOONLIT WATER –
CAMERA MOVES past floating TRASH, a CAR TIRE, BOTTLES and CANS. We hear
the CRIES of the CATS from nearby, approaching. LIGHTS of the CITY
further away, the BRIDGE visible. CAMERA FINDS a nylon-encased FOOT… PAN
OVER a woman’s CORPSE, her clothes TORN, SOAKED and MUDDY, strewn with
RIVER WEEDS. The body bobs amidst REEDS by this soggy shoreline. We
reach the woman’s FACE – unnaturally pale, eyes fixed… it’s PATIENCE
PRICE. Dead. THE HOWLING is CLOSE now… THE CATS have gathered here,
parting for MIDNIGHT, a feline VIP. The Mau steps tentatively out onto
Patience’s corpse, careful not to get too wet. She crouches on her
chest, and – CLOSE, BREATHES audibly into her parted lips. A brief,
barely visible GLOW flickers at Patience’s mouth. THE CAT shudders, then
moves aside, BLINKS as if drugged. ANOTHER CAT climbs out onto Patience
to take Midnight’s place and perform the same ritual.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: HIGH ANGLE. The crowd of CATS waiting in
the reeds, more arriving by the minute, ready to take turns. CAMERA
ROCKETS DOWN AT PATIENCE’S FACE, into one DEAD EYE…</p>
<p><strong>dark, distorted; quick impressionistic images
overlap,</strong>: perhaps CAT POVS mixed with human MEMORIES: POV, a
ROLLER-COASTER, PATIENCE’S PARENTS to either side – we hear YOUNG
PATIENCE’S LAUGHTER and SHRIEKS. CLOSE TO GROUND, FATSO the KITTEN
dashes after a BELL BALL. POV, YOUNG PATIENCE at a mirror in a Halloween
CAT COSTUME. POV, CLIMBING A TREE in a suburban backyard. We see her MOM
below, searching for young Patience. POV, TWO CLOSED COFFINS, surrounded
by FLOWERS… now we hear</p>
<p><strong>young patience sobbing.</strong>: POV, the BLACK MERCEDES
ROCKETS AT CAMERA and –</p>
<p><strong>ext. marshland - night</strong>: – PATIENCE sits up INTO
FRAME with a SCREAM. She thrashes in the shallows of the marsh, gasping
for air, disoriented… reborn. There’s no sign of the cats. PATIENCE
crawls onto shore amidst the reeds, slightly clumsy at first, almost
like a newborn kitten. Her ragged, wet clothes cling to her body. TIGHT
on her terrified expression. She has no idea what she’s doing here – or
who, or what she is. She opens her mouth to speak – all that comes out
is a strangled CAT CRY. She works her jaw, but can’t produce human
speech. She darts her head, seems disoriented and overwhelmed. HER POV –
SOUNDS AMPLIFIED, IMAGE perhaps SOLARIZED, the darkness BRIGHTENED,
objects of interest HIGHLIGHTED as she takes in the marshland. The EYES
of any creature in sight GLOW. We’ll call this CATVISION.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: WHIP PAN TO a nearby CRICKET perched on
a blade of grass – then UP TO an OWL in the distance, soaring over the
park. WHIP DOWN TO its prey, a SCURRYING MOUSE. THE OWL swoops with a
SCREECH, nailing the MOUSE, we hear its SQUEAL. PATIENCE, frightened at
first, becomes increasingly delighted by her heightened senses. She
spots – MIDNIGHT in the tall grass. The cat turns, looks over her
shoulder once – her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW. Patience is clearly
meant to follow. PATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours, tenuously at
first. But as she proceeds, her shoulders and hips roll in distinctly
feline fashion. Her body seems slimmer, more muscular. She rises on two
legs, moving in a slinky crouch. MIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on
the bark of a gnarled old TREE. PATIENCE follows Midnight’s lead, leans
forward against the trunk, arms straight out, head arched back. She
stretches her neck, her back – her every movement is graceful, sensual,
the awkwardness gone. She tries to pull her hands from the tree – but
can’t for a moment, finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark . A DOG
BARKS – without thinking about it, PATIENCE scrambles up the side of the
tree like a streak. HER POV FROM TREE – A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNER’S
leash, some distance away. The dog walker yanks the dog onward. PATIENCE
takes this in, hears a MEOW – MIDNIGHT is perched above her, very
Cheshire Cat-like. PATIENCE looks around, self-conscious for a moment –
what is she doing up a tree? Bad idea to think. She loses her balance,
clutching at branches, tumbles out of the tree – IN MIDAIR for an
instant, she flails spastically, letting out a SHRIEK – then her body
instinctively TWISTS and – PATIENCE LANDS on all fours, one leg kicked
out, haunches low. MIDNIGHT lands beside her, nods approvingly at her
landing. Then the cat darts away again, Patience pursues.</p>
<p><strong>ext. suburban neighborhood - night</strong>: MIDNIGHT leaps
to the top of a FENCE, staring down at Patience – “come on.” Patience
hesitates, then crouches and SPRINGS UP , lands triumphantly on the
fence – then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side. MIDNIGHT looks
disappointed. Patience jumps up again quickly, as if pretending this
never happened, this time managing to hold her balance. MIDNIGHT gives
her a look and leads onward. At first she’s like a tightrope walker,
careful of falling, but her steps become more confident. Soon she’s
moving as quickly and smoothly as the cat. MIDNIGHT leaps off the fence
and darts across a road, PATIENCE follows.</p>
<p><strong>ext. public garden/zoo - night</strong>: A tall wrought-iron
FENCE surrounds greenery and distant cages in an urban area. A SIGN:
“ARBORETUM - ZOO.” MIDNIGHT squeezes through a gap between the uprights.
PATIENCE hesitates – this is too narrow for a normal human. MIDNIGHT
waits impatiently on the other side, tail twitching. PATIENCE makes a
dubious SOUND, but manages to slip a foot – then a leg – into the
opening, twisting and contorting. Amazingly, she’s succeeding, her torso
ripples and contracts as she insinuates herself between the bars.
Finally only her head is on the wrong side. With a final TUG, she’s
through. MIDNIGHT crouches low, stalking. PATIENCE copies the behavior.
MIDNIGHT slowly approaches – A MOTH, fluttering near a FLOWER in this
botanical garden. MIDNIGHT sneaks up close, then POUNCES, but the MOTH
flies out of the cat’s grasp.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PATIENCE blinks, crouches – and ROARS
back, unafraid. The tiger springs forward… and LICKS HER. She wrestles
with him playfully, he’s just a bigger version of Midnight.</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - bedroom - morning</strong>: EDNA POWERS
sleeps in bed. MIDNIGHT climbs atop her, starts kneading. She makes a
NOISE, rolls over, opens her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Midnight? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ext. edna’s home - day</strong>: EDNA emerges in a bathrobe,
crossing her overgrown lawn, MIDNIGHT bounding ahead of her. A Martha
Stewarty NEIGHBOR, weeding an immaculate garden, throws Edna a sour
look.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Edna, your cats have been using my garden
as a litter box again.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You can’t change their nature.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: What are you doing in my hedge?</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - living room - day</strong>: PATIENCE is
wrapped in a BLANKET, sitting on the couch, MIDNIGHT nuzzling her, as
EDNA brings her a cup of TEA. Edna picks up a CLIPBOARD from a coffee
table.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Your name is Patience Price, you live on South
87th. You love chocolate – you’re afraid of heights? Any of this ring a
bell?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I… it’s coming back to me. But last night…
it’s just… it’s like a dream.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You said in your application that you don’t
drink or take drugs.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I don’t. I think… something must have
happened. I need to…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You need to rest.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You’re in no condition to –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Sorry, you – you startled me… look, Edna,
thanks for everything, but – I just want to get home and take a
bath.</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - office - day</strong>: EDNA moves
purposefully to a FILE CABINET in this cluttered, book-lined room and
opens a drawer. She thumbs past many years’ worth of scholarly research,
finally pulling a thick, dog-eared MANILA FILE from near the back. She
moves to her desk, slips on reading glasses and opens the folder – ANGLE
ON FILE – an old, thick type-written SCHOLARLY PAPER entitled “MYTHS OF
FELIGYNY, by E. POWERS Ph.D.” She puts this aside, revealing a WOODCUT
of an AFRICAN Catwoman in leopard skin, surrounded by cats. Next, an
ASIAN CATWOMAN, a print of a 19th Century watercolor. She wears a
Chinese- style MASK, close-fitting robes, a long tail. Both
illustrations show the women with CLAWS and ELLIPTICAL</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Behind her, THE BATHTUB RUNS, almost
filled. She moves to the edge of the tub, starting to undo her ragged
clothes, stares down at – THE RIPPLING WATER. She blinks, her expression
far away –</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. patience’s head</strong>: A vertiginous
PLUNGE from the bridge toward DARK WATER –</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - bathroom - day</strong>: PATIENCE
starts, shaking off this momentary vision. She dips a finger in the
water, jerks back – much as a cat might. She shakes drops off her hand,
repelled by the water.</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - day</strong>: There’s KNOCKING at
the door. The PHONE IS RINGING, a MACHINE picks up. We hear RUNNING
WATER from beyond the closed bathroom door.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: This is Patience, you can leave a message
if you want…</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - bathroom - day</strong>: PATIENCE
turns off the TAPS, in the quiet she hears EDNA’S VOICE on her answering
machine.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: It’s Edna Powers – the most extraordinary
thing, I – I think I know what’s happened to you –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – THE DOORKNOB RATTLING, someone trying
to get in.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: – be careful, Patience, I’m afraid you may be
in danger…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I am so, so sorry –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You actually hit me with a frying pan?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I didn’t know it was you.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Guess we’re even now. Name’s Tom Lone, by the
way.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Patience Price.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Yeah, I know, I checked your ID.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh God, not that awful driver’s license
picture –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Got any ice?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PATIENCE hurries to assemble an ice
pack, MIDNIGHT is eating happily at the table, LONE gets to his
feet.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I found your purse in the street right outside
this morning. I tried calling – I was afraid something might’ve happened
to you…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: That was really nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Well, it’s part of my job… I’m a detective,
burglary-robbery division. So what did happen to you?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh no, I’m a mess. It seems every time you
see me I – I was just cleaning. The um, the chimney.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Where’s the fireplace?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It wasn’t mine.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You’re a freelance chimney sweep?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You should get that fixed.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh yeah, I hadn’t noticed… I mean, I had
to break it to get in because… I lost my purse.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Funny, looks like it was broken from
inside.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: So everything’s all right now? Well, I’d
better be getting to the station, then… unless there’s anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I guess not…</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Then – bye, now.</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s building - hallway - day</strong>: PATIENCE
flings open the door, calls after Lone:</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I want you…</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I want you, um, to forgive me. For hitting
you like that.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: No need – woman living alone, you can’t take
any chances.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PATIENCE nods unsurely, starts to
retreat into the apartment. LONE thinks, calls out to her.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Listen, I was gonna grab a cup of coffee…</p>
<p><strong>int. coffee shop - day</strong>: LONE and PATIENCE move from
a COUNTER with COFFEE CUPS in hand. Patience has cleaned up, dressed a
little sexier than usual – she looks good.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: So, did you always want to be a policeman?
God, listen to me, Conversation 101.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Hey, we gotta start somewhere. Actually, when
I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I was kind of a delinquent back then, got into
some trouble. There was a cop who helped me out. Made a difference. I
figured… maybe I could do the same.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Plus you can still get into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Right, but for the good guys… So what do you
do? When you’re not dumpster diving or cleaning chimneys, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Accounting. That is, I used to, I just
lost my job.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Don’t be, it was pretty dull. I guess when
you get down to it, I’m pretty dull.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Let me start over. It’s just… I never got
into any trouble or anything –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Come on, never?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Well, when I was little, but – after I
lost my folks I… I guess I turned into sort of a scaredy- ca – um,
pretty risk-averse.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: That’s not a bad thing. It’s a pretty
dangerous world.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Sometimes I just wish I was less of a
wimp.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You’re not afraid to admit you’re afraid –
that takes guts.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It does?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Most women I know pretend to be tougher than
they really are. Listen… if you ever need someone – to look out for you,
keep an eye on – – or whatever – I’m available.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Oh hey, I didn’t mean that to sound like a
come-on –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I mean, unless you… I’m just going to shut up
now and go.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: See you around.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Yeah, you will.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal factory - day</strong>: LAUREL’S SMILING FACE on
a BILLBOARD. It’s only there for a moment, quickly plastered over with –
A NEW BILLBOARD featuring DRINA’S FACE. We’re outside a dramatic, gated
industrial COMPLEX, TRUCKS with the AVENAL LOGO, a sprawling CHEMICAL
FACTORY at the center.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - georges’ office - day</strong>: HUGE
VATS, DUCTS, PIPES, etc., it’s a busy, VERY NOISY environment. CAMERA
FINDS GEORGES’ OFFICE, large windows overlooking the factory floor.
INSIDE, behind the thick windows, it’s SILENT. This is a hard, masculine
space, all steel and wood. GEORGES stands by a table, WESLEY and ANGEL
at his side; IVAN NEVSKI, 50s, a smoldering Russian scientist, is
showing them</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: GEORGES flips through these quickly, his
tone frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Okay, with too much YP-3 you get
side-effects – but too much of anything is bad for you – tap water,
sunshine, cigarettes –</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: It’s like leprosy or something…</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: The point is, now that we’ve adjusted the
formula, Beaunique works. Plumps the skin, removes wrinkles, leaves a
nice rosy glow – it’s perfectly safe now, my own wife uses it…</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: You want to be beautiful, you’ve got to
make certain sacrifices. I mean, look at Botox, women are lining up to
get their faces paralyzed.</p>
<p><strong>nevski</strong>: Enough! Pretending my YP-3 is only for your
cosmetics, feh! You’ve known about these “side- effects” from the start,
they are not side-effects at all –</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: What? You’re not making sense –</p>
<p><strong>nevski</strong>: I thought I’d left this sort of madness
behind me - - then I find out you’ve been in contact with Xavier Bartok
–</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I’ve never heard of the man.</p>
<p><strong>nevski</strong>: I still have connections. You may have used
me, but I am not a fool.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Doctor Nevski, is it possible you’ve gone
insane?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Russians, sheesh.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: As if I don’t have enough on my mind.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Changes are going to have to be made… and
change can be painful.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: It isn’t easy to eliminate an established
brand…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Sir, are you seriously thinking of recalling
Beaunique –?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I’m not talking about Beaunique.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: A famous poet once said, beauty is truth,
truth beauty…</p>
<p><strong>ext. urban park - day</strong>: A HOMELESS CAMP – tents,
boxes, etc. – nearby. BAG LADIES stand in a line near MAKE-UP STOOLS,
AVENAL GIRLS are busy painting their faces, doing their best.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: …or maybe it’s the other way around…</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: The point is, everyone deserves to look in
the mirror and feel good about themselves. Be we rich or poor, we all
must strive to be more beautiful than we can be…</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>process server</strong>: Laurel Avenal, I am hereby serving
you with a restraining order.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>process server</strong>: You are not to set foot within one
hundred yards of any property owned or occupied by Avenal Beauty
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I – this must be some sort of mistake –</p>
<p><strong>process server</strong>: You will, however, have sixty days
to remain in residence at the Avenal estate, at the end of which time
you and all your personal property must be –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Georges Avenal is my husband!</p>
<p><strong>process server</strong>: That brings me to this petition for
divorce…</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - night</strong>: PATIENCE’S
SLEEPING FACE. She stirs, stretches. WIDER, she’s lying on top of a
BOOKCASE in a twisted, awkward position. MIDNIGHT jumps up and brushes
against her. CLOSE ON PATIENCE’S EYES – they FLY OPEN, GOLD-FLECKED and
ELLIPTICAL. PATIENCE – now pure CATWOMAN – springs down gracefully and
scans the dark apartment. She stretches her limbs languorously, licks
her lips. She flexes her fingers, watching appreciatively as her CLAWS
EMERGE. She reaches out and SPEARS LONE’S CARD on a fingernail, regards
it as she picks up the receiver. With another CLAW she unhesitatingly
punches in the number. When she speaks, after a beat, her voice is
throaty, sexier – whenever she’s Catwoman, she’ll talk this way. During
the following, she toys with the long PHONE CORD like a cat.</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: Mmm, too bad you’re not there…
guess I’ll have to go out and play by myself.</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: What a dump.</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: Ugh – please – frowsy –</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: Damn, I haven’t got a thing to
wear!</p>
<p><strong>multiple alarms ring.</strong>: QUICK CUTS of STOREFRONTS,
WINDOWS SMASHED – the SHOE STORE, the LINGERIE STORE, the WESTERN WEAR
SHOP, the TRENDY BOUTIQUE. The MANNEQUIN that had displayed the Gaultier
knock-off is now NAKED.</p>
<p><strong>ext. trendy club - night</strong>: THRONGS out front behind
the velvet ropes. All eyes turn toward an approaching FIGURE whom we
don’t see at first… LOW ANGLE – a sleek pair of black patent leather
BOOTS appears. A purring rendition of a familiar children’s tune:</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: And the cat came back, the very next
day…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: The cat came back, they thought she was a
goner…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: But the cat came back, she just wouldn’t
stay awa- a-ay…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: What’s the word I’m looking for? Oh yes…
Meow.</p>
<p><strong>int. trendy club - night</strong>: Dramatic DECOR, throbbing
MUSIC, DANCING TRENDIES. CATWOMAN moves confidently through the club.
PATRONS can’t help but stare, getting out of her path as she crosses the
room. RANDY and SANDY, the rude couple, are bellied up to the bar.
CATWOMAN slithers between them, almost unnoticed at first. RANDY starts
as something FLICKS against his back – CATWOMAN holds the end of her
WHIP/TAIL, smacking it lightly against his rear end. He looks up at
her.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Buy me a drink.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: White Russian, no ice, hold the vodka and
Kahlua.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me, earth to slut – he’s
taken.</p>
<p><strong>– splash.</strong>: CLOSE – a FURBALL in the woman’s drink.
SANDY backs away, making a horrified noise.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Euw!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Cream, straight up.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Don’t touch my tail.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She pulls him against her, clutches his
butt – then PUSHES HIM AWAY, spinning him out on the whip like a top –
his TROUSERS have been SHREDDED, the belt SLICED. His pants drop to his
ankles, he stumbles back in his loud bikini underwear, losing his
balance and falling. THE CROWD reacts, laughter.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: That’s enough for one night, honey.</p>
<p><strong>stops.</strong>: MORE CLUB GOONS appear from the back,
approach angrily.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Guess the party’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ext. trendy club - night</strong>: CATWOMAN hurls open the
front doors, kicks aside the velvet rope. She addresses the impatient
CROWD:</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: C’mon in, wanna-bes! Free drinks!</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway - night</strong>: CATWOMAN strutting confidently
down the narrow GUARDRAIL between the two directions of SPEEDING
TRAFFIC.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She could be out for an evening stroll,
ignoring the SCREECHING BRAKES, HORNS, and STARTLED DRIVERS. She gives
them a wave without bothering to look over her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>ext. tenement rooftop - night</strong>: A CHICKEN-WIRE DOOR
explodes open and a FLOCK OF PIGEONS ROCKETS OUT of a COOP AT CAMERA.
CATWOMAN emerges in a CLOUD OF FEATHERS, brushing a few stray ones off
her outfit, with a cat-that-ate-the-canary smile. She cocks her head,
listening in different directions for a new source of amusement –
snippets of VOICES, MUSIC, PLUMBING SFX, passing VEHICLES… it’s like
tuning a radio. Then she picks up a distant TINKLE of breaking GLASS
–</p>
<p><strong>int. jewelry store - night</strong>: Dimly lit, an older,
discount place. THIEF #1 methodically breaks DISPLAY CASES with a
wrapped hammer, snatches up the contents – necklaces, rings, etc. –
stuffing them into a</p>
<p><strong>bag.</strong>: As he moves, a SHADOWY FIGURE – CATWOMAN –
moves with him, looking over his shoulder, close enough to touch but
unseen. Each time he turns his head, she has just slinked out of his
view – her timing is impeccable. THIEF #2, with a SHOTGUN, stands guard
over a blindfolded, bound-and-gagged NIGHT WATCHMAN. CATWOMAN appears on
the periphery of his vision, but when he turns his head she’s
disappeared behind a case – she emerges on the other side just before he
turns back. THIEF #3 is at work on a LOCKED STEEL CASE of DRAWERS with a
BLOWTORCH and TOOLS. CATWOMAN STEPS LIGHTLY across the CASE above him,
he looks up – but there’s nobody there. He returns to his work, gets the
CASE open and pulls out a DRAWER revealing a RACK full of glittering
DIAMONDS.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Oooh, pretty.</p>
<p><strong>thief #1</strong>: Up there!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: THIEF #2 aims his SHOTGUN at – CATWOMAN,
perched on a narrow LEDGE at the ceiling moulding. She VAULTS down just
as he FIRES, a SPRAY OF PLASTER. THIEF #2 pumps his shotgun, looking
around frantically.</p>
<p><strong>thief #2</strong>: What the hell was that?!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You boys – thought you could just barge –
in here and take – all these beautiful things – that don’t belong to
you…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: What a lovely idea.</p>
<p><strong>thief #3</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>ext. jewelry store alley - night</strong>: CATWOMAN bounds
out the exit, leaps atop BOXES, onto a window A/C UNIT, which totters
with her weight, just as –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: AN UNMARKED SEDAN screeches to a halt,
and TOM LONE leaps out, GUN ready. He trains it on CATWOMAN –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You are cute.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I’m a police officer!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Bet you look sweet in uniform. And such a
big gun…</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I, I – Come down here, now!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Obviously you don’t know much about cats.
I come when I want, not when I’m told.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftops/city streets - night</strong>: CATWOMAN,
silhouetted against the sky, is having a great time, leaping from
building to building, scrambling across rooftops. POLICE SIRENS recede
in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>ext. zoo - dawn</strong>: THE SUN is rising. PAN OVER a
couple of GLITTERING JEWELS in the dirt. FIND CATWOMAN in the GOLDEN
MORNING LIGHT, curled against what looks like a TIGER-SKIN PILLOW. She
stirs and groans in her sleep, like someone waking with a hangover.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She blinks and frowns at the SUNLIGHT.
Where am I? She sits up and realizes – she was sleeping against the
belly of the BENGAL TIGER, lying on his side in his sunken ENCLOSURE.
CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet, terrified, yanks OFF HER MASK.
With the daylight, she’s back to being plain old PATIENCE. She looks
down in shock at her revealing outfit; the swag bag is looped into the
whip around her waist. She’s awakened the TIGER. Patience lets out
another frightened CRY as he eyes her, no longer recognizing her as a
friend. The tiger GROWLS, gets to his feet menacingly, starts moving in
for the kill. PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR, which she
frantically wrestles to open, getting through and SLAMMING IT just as
the TIGER LUNGES –</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - kitchen - day</strong>: A KITTEN pounces
on a CAT TOY.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: – but this time, it was like the tiger
wanted to kill me…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You were afraid – you became its prey. The
tiger shredded your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No, I did that myself. I mean, I remember
doing it, but it wasn’t really – you know – me. God, I don’t understand
what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: I’m not sure how to put this – it may be hard
for you to accept – but I’m something of an expert in these matters
–</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: What matters?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Vampirism, lycanthropy… feligyny.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Feles, Latin for cat. Gynos, Greek for female.
I’m a professor of folklore and mythology – that is, I used to be, until
I was denied tenure. They said my work was frivolous, but it was an
all-male department, and – well, it’s a long, sordid story</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Edna, please. Can we talk about me?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Oh, yes. The other night… I think you may
have… had an accident. A very serious accident. Fatal.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: But – I’m not dead.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Not anymore, dear. After you died, you were
reborn. As a catwoman.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Mint or chamomile?</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - office - day</strong>: PAN OVER
PRINT-OUTS, PAPERS, open BOOKS. A HIEROGLYPHIC of a figure half-feline,
half-female in a heavy TOME.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: The cult of catwomen dates back to Ancient
Egypt, where felines were first domesticated.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Excuse me, Cicero.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: The temple of the Catgod, Bast. A Persian army
destroyed it in the fifth century BC.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Legend has it that the priestesses became the
first catwomen. The cats they’d worshipped – Midnight’s ancestors – each
gave up one of its nine lives to bring them back from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: In the middle ages, cats and catwomen were
regarded as evil. Nonsense, of course, witches were just single,
independent women who broke society’s rules.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: There were reports of a catwoman a while back
on the East Coast – like many, she turned to a life of crime – but
apparently she’s disappeared or died.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PATIENCE studies the photo.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: How many have there been?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: No one can be sure. I’ve found references
scattered through history, but catwomen tend to lead solitary, secretive
lives. Hard to blame them, it seems most were murder victims.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I was murdered? Why would anybody kill me?
No, I never did anything to… I don’t want to break the rules!</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - living room - day</strong>: PATIENCE
paces, EDNA looks on sympathetically.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: She’s like some demon, possessing me in
the night, but – but I can keep it under control during the day –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Well, cats do sleep most of the day –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: When she takes over – it’s like, she just
does whatever she feels like, she doesn’t care what people think –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Is that so bad?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: You don’t understand – I’m afraid she’s
going to hurt someone – or get me killed. Again.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: There’s got to be a way to make it stop.
Some kind of, I don’t know, garlic or wolfsbane or something…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: A domestic cat can return to its natural state
effortlessly. But once a cat’s gone feral, it can never be tamed.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Okay… that isn’t helping.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Relax a little, learn to live with your inner
cat. Even love her – she has many admirable qualities – integrate her
into your life. If you accept the darker impulses, try to channel them –
maybe she’ll come to be domesticated –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No. I’m going to fight her. I’m stronger
than she is –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: But you’re only fighting yourself –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: – and I’m going to win.</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - alley - day</strong>: PATIENCE
comes out of a back door of her building with a GARBAGE BAG, still
looking around nervously, moving toward the dumpster in the alley. She
tosses in the bag – ANGLE IN DUMPSTER, the BAG spills open to reveal
pieces of the CATWOMAN OUTFIT. PATIENCE moves back for the door –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: We’ve got to stop meeting like this.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Doing some spring cleaning?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Emptying the catbox, actually.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: So – that was a… surprising message you left
for me.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh, well, uh – musta been my cold
medication talking.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Well anyway, if you still wanted to get
together – maybe we could get a bite to eat Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Yeah, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - day</strong>: PATIENCE dances
with MIDNIGHT, overcome with joy. She holds the cat at arm’s length,
sings a TUNE of her own making:</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Tom Lone, Tom Lone, I called him on the
phone – now I won’t be alone –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It was Catwoman who made the call. What’s
he ever gonna see in me?</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - showroom - day</strong>: THE DOOR OPENS and
PATIENCE enters. She keeps her head down, not wanting to be noticed.
SALLY spots her, follows her through the showroom toward the
elevators.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Patience, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Just came by to clean out my desk.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Hm. Did you dye –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: – your hair. You look different somehow.
Cooler.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are you going to the funeral? I know, tinted
contacts.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: What funeral?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You didn’t know? Dave Berger, your boss – his
whole place blew up, gas explosion, the night you got fired.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yeah, life’s short, huh. The hottie neighbor!
That glow, you’re getting some, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - accounting bullpen - day</strong>: A
GARFIELD TOY lands atop XEROXED CARTOONS and personal PAPERS in a
CARDBOARD BOX. PATIENCE is cleaning out her cubicle in the office.
Noticing a flashing LIGHT on her phone, she hits a MESSAGE BUTTON and
picks up the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Patience, it’s Dave…</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: I called the CEO about your YP-3 numbers –
Avenal went ballistic. I’ll have to redo the spreadsheets, you must’ve
screwed up somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Like hell.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: End of final message.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Patience absorbs this a moment, then
sits down and TURNS ON her COMPUTER with a PING. ON PATIENCE’S COMPUTER
SCREEN – the words, “YP-3 PROJECT,” text and the names of a few PEOPLE
in charge. PATIENCE leans forward, reading quickly, quietly to
herself.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: ‘Miracle ingredient in Beaunique… just a
drop makes wrinkles vanish, blah blah blah…’ But what is it?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Dr. Ivan Nevski, in charge of development.
Huh, not in the company directory.</p>
<p><strong>“secret research,” “chemical weapons,” “bacterial
warfare.”</strong>: PATIENCE sits back, baffled and disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - evening</strong>: PATIENCE is
sitting up in bed, reading a BIOCHEMISTRY TEXT, PRINT-OUTS and RESEARCH
MATERIAL around her. She YAWNS, squirms – something is coming over her.
Her eyes pop open.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No. Oh no, not again.</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - alley - night</strong>: A GLOVED
HAND grips the edge of the DUMPSTER – then CATWOMAN vaults over the
side, lands on her haunches, ready to rumble. Her outfit has a banana
peel stuck to it. She wrinkles her nose, plucks this off, CLUCKING her
tongue. She turns to MIDNIGHT, prowling nearby.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: That girl has got to go.</p>
<p><strong>int. lone’s apartment - night</strong>: CATWOMAN SCRATCHES at
the window… the place is DARK, no response. She PUNCHES out a pane of
glass and slithers in.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Boy, you don’t know what you’re
missing…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Avenal…</p>
<p><strong>int. catwoman’s head</strong>: Impressionistic POV
FLASHBACKS, V.O.s overlapping, echoing, repeating… all snippets of
previously heard dialogue. POV – GEORGES AVENAL, chewing Patience out in
the ELEVATOR.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Most catwomen were murder victims…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I was murdered?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Why would anybody kill me?</p>
<p><strong>… yp-3… yp-3…</strong>: POV – from PATIENCE, lying on the
street. HER BLURRING VISION drifts toward the MERCEDES, a SILHOUETTED
FIGURE behind the wheel, seen from behind.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Avenal went ballistic…</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: You’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>int. lone’s apartment - night</strong>: SMASH! CATWOMAN
throws the COLOGNE BOTTLE against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal mansion - night</strong>: A sprawling MANSION,
dark for the night, an “A” in iron scroll-work over the gate. FIND a
SECURITY CAMERA, trained on the area in front of a ten-foot WALL.
MIDNIGHT suddenly leaps onto the wall, blocking and batting at the
CAMERA LENS.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: AT THE SIDE OF THE MANSION – CATWOMAN
scrambles up a trellis toward a second-story window. She leaps to the
ledge, crouches, peering in. CLOSE as a razor-sharp CLAW emerges and
CUTS a CIRCLE into a</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal mansion - hallway - night</strong>: The CIRCLE OF
GLASS pops out and lands on soft CARPET. CATWOMAN reaches her arm in,
unlatches the window, and swings inside into the darkness. CATWOMAN
moves stealthily, crouching, senses alert.</p>
<p><strong>her pov - catvision</strong>: The dark hallway GLOWS. An
amplified NOISE from a distance… SNORING.</p>
<p><strong>on catwoman’s hands</strong>: Her NAILS emerge from her
gloved fingertips, ready to rumble. CATWOMAN rounds a corner toward a
large formal staircase that wraps around a huge chandelier. She nears a
door which is slightly ajar, pushes it open silently and enters –</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal mansion - bedroom - night</strong>: HER POV –
CATVISION, nearing a huge, curtained CANOPY BED. CATWOMAN slashes the
curtain aside, to reveal – TIPPY THE LAP DOG, curled up in the center of
the otherwise unoccupied bed, SNORING away. The dog awakens, raises its
head, and starts BARKING FURIOUSLY. CATWOMAN hisses at the creature. It
cringes and shivers, seeking cover beneath a pillow.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She’s struck hard in the back and the
head – she topples forward, ROLLS DOWN THE STAIRS. She hits a LANDING,
curled up, dazed, clutching her skull. LIGHTS COME ON – LAUREL looks
down at her from the top of the stairs, wearing silk pajamas, golf club
in hand. She descends cautiously, club raised. LAUREL tentatively pokes
at the prone, black-clad Catwoman with her foot. CATWOMAN instantly
SPRINGS UP. As Laurel starts to bring the club down, Catwoman grabs it
and yanks it away, hurling it into the foyer below, then grabs LAUREL
and slams her against the wall. Laurel seems utterly terrified -</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh God, please – please don’t hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: That was Venetian crystal, you bitch –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: A bitch is a dog.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The two engage in martial arts combat,
moving down the stairs into the marble foyer. They exchange lines
between BLOWS:</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You’re tougher than you look.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Took classes when I was modeling in Hong
Kong. Damn it, I broke a nail.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Had enough?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Is that a Gaultier?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I hate water.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: No, please – not Tippy!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Where’s your husband?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Georges? Why didn’t you say you wanted him
in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CATWOMAN slowly puts the dog down, it
scampers upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You one of his girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I don’t belong to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Not my face, not my face!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: If I can’t get to Georges, I can at least
scratch up something he loves –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Georges doesn’t love me! I don’t know if he
ever did –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: How sad. I’d cry if I cared.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: He never took me seriously, I was just a, a
trophy. And now he’s bored, he found himself a new toy –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I’ve heard this story before. Where is
he?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: He never comes home anymore – I, I know he’s
got a box for the ballet Friday night –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I can’t wait that long. I want him
now.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I swear I don’t know where he is, he’s left
me! Oh God, my career is in the toilet, my whole life is over – go
ahead, tear me to pieces –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LAUREL is beginning to get hysterical.
Catwoman lets out a frustrated GROWL and lets go of her, this is
useless. She starts for the door, Laurel sniffs back tears then
follows.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Wait… try the factory. I think that’s where
he meets Drano, his new mistress.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I’ll check it out.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What do you want with him, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: It’s personal.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Are you going to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Depends on my mood.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I’ll pay you to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: And here I thought you were just some
brain-dead mannequin –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I’ll even give you a lift, if you’ll let me
watch -</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Sorry, I work alone. But I like your
attitude.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - georges’ office - night</strong>: MOOD
MUSIC plays, GEORGES is on the sofa, in a silk robe, beside DRINA.
Drinks are on hand, Georges is attempting to neck with her. She pays him
no mind, a remote in hand, rewinding a VIDEO that plays on a plasma
SCREEN.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ON TV, IMAGES OF DRINA dissolve into
each other quickly – she DANCES IN A BALL-GOWN, CHAIRS a CORPORATE BOARD
MEETING, finally pulls into the winners’ circle in a FORMULA RACE CAR,
pulls off her helmet and shakes her hair out.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Discover the fountain of youth… in a jar.
Beaunique by Avenal.</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: I look fat.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: We’ll shoot another.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - night</strong>: A small crew of NIGHT
WORKERS wearing JUMPERS and PAPER MASKS tend the elaborate industrial
MACHINERY, it’s DEAFENING here. SWIRLING GOO the color of HUMAN SKIN
PUMPS through PLASTIC PIPES into a huge SEALED VAT. RAINBOWS of NAIL
POLISHES squirt out of NOZZLES into BOTTLES. LIPSTICK STICKS screw down
into their TUBES and are CAPPED on</p>
<p><strong>conveyor belts.</strong>: OVERHEAD, amidst DUCTING and PIPES,
CATWOMAN is on the move. HER CLAWS rake across a row of RUBBER TUBES,
which spray multi-colored FLUIDS.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: WITH A WORKER DRONE, CLICKING a hand
counter by rote as CASES of neatly-packed jars of NAIL POLISH pass by
his station. The man is half-asleep. A CASE COMES BY, a bit crooked on
the belt, which is beginning to VIBRATE… The next CASE is missing half
its bottles. An ALARM BLEEPS, RED LIGHTS FLASHING in b.g. The next CASE
is filled with BROKEN GLASS, DRENCHED in NAIL POLISH – it gets his
attention. He THROWS LEVERS to stop the belt. WIDER, THE FACTORY is in
CHAOS. STEAM shoots out of PRESSURE TUBES, COLORED LIQUIDS bubble out of
overflowing TANKS, FACE POWDER sprays into the air from a disconnected
HOSE. WORKERS dash about frantically, SHOUTING and PANICKED.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - georges’ office - night</strong>: THE
CHAOS in the factory is clearly visible through the window, but GEORGES
can’t hear a thing – he and DRINA are groping each other on the couch
now. A nearby INTERCOM is BUZZING, Georges finally pushes a talk button,
angry.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: This had better be import – oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - night</strong>: The MACHINERY is off
now, but the place is a wreck, CLOUDS of STEAM and POWDER, RIVERS of
NAIL POLISH on the floor, etc. A handful of panicking WORKERS struggle
to shut down a large DISTILLATION VAT, which RUMBLES ominously. SECURITY
GUARDS are pouring in, one speaks rapidly into a WALKIE-TALKIE, looking
upwards as he climbs stairs to a network of catwalks overlooking the
factory.</p>
<p><strong>walkie-talkie</strong>: Better stay in your office, sir, keep
the door sealed. The saboteurs may still be on the premises.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Who is responsible for this?!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As if on cue, CATWOMAN LEAPS down from
above, planting a KICK in the man’s back – the walkie-talkie flies from
his grasp, she catches it in mid-air, holds it to her lips.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: That would be me, Georgy boy.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Come out of your hole, let’s have some
fun.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Are you crazy?! Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: A kitten with a whip. You like my
makeover? I even had my nails done –</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Here, kitty kitty…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Another guard SWINGS at her, she grabs
the end of the nightstick and pulls him toward her, snatching a can of
MACE off his belt and BLASTING him in the face with it. He’s blinded,
lets out a cry as she tosses him aside. THE OTHERS come at her at once.
CATWOMAN plays them against each other, LEAPING and DODGING, landing
KICKS in their CHESTS, leaving Zorro-like SCRATCH MARKS across their
uniforms whenever she gets the chance. WITH GEORGES and DRINA, awed by
the martial arts display.</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: Find out where she got those boots.</p>
<p><strong>bitten guard</strong>: Ow! You fight like a girl!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Duh.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Just shoot the bitch!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I’m not finished with you, Georgy!</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - duct - night</strong>: CATWOMAN rockets
downwards, BULLETS PERFORATE the DUCT WORK just behind her.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - night</strong>: THE VAT EXPLODES UPWARD
like a VOLCANO, DRENCHING ANGEL and the GUARDS with FLESH-COLORED
FOUNDATION.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - basement - night</strong>: DARKNESS, A
GRILL EXPLODES from the ceiling with CATWOMAN’S IMPACT, she topples
through and lands on a TABLE of GLASSWARE, which UPENDS, we hear GLASS
SHATTER. CATWOMAN is instantly on all fours on the ground, breathing
hard. She moves through the dark room, becoming aware of –</p>
<p><strong>hundreds of gleaming eyes.</strong>: CATWOMAN flips on a
WALL-SWITCH – – revealing GLASS-WALLED CAGES containing SQUEAKING BLACK
RATS. CATWOMAN instinctively HISSES and SWIPES A CLAW in their direction
– they shrink back from the glass. MANY HUGE DRUMS stenciled “YP-3” are
stored against a far wall, near HOODED CLEAN SUITS and BIOHAZARD SIGNS.
CATWOMAN spots a LIST of names and numbers on a bulletin board. She
snatches this, studying it – CLOSE – the name IVAN NEVSKI, with an
ADDRESS and NUMBER.</p>
<p><strong>ext. victorian duplex - night</strong>: Neatly kept, colorful
architecture. CATWOMAN moves down sloping eaves and swings into a turret
window.</p>
<p><strong>int. nevski’s apartment - night</strong>: CATWOMAN moves
stealthily inside the dimly lit place. It’s upscale, expensively
furnished. She scans the room, sees –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: NEVSKI, his back turned, apparently
dozing in a desk chair. CATWOMAN spins him in his chair to confront him
–</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Ivan Nevski –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You’re no help.</p>
<p><strong>pestis - a natural history.”</strong>: The book is hot to the
touch, she DROPS it, studies it.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Yersinia Pestis… YP…</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Dr. Nevski, are you all – aah!</p>
<p><strong>int. arms cache - day</strong>: Lush vegetation and tropical
sunlight through walls of netting in this immense camouflage tent.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CAMERA MOVES PAST racks of AIR-TO-AIR
MISSILES, RPGs, a JET FIGHTER and a large military CARGO CHOPPER. XAVIER
BARTOK, a well-dressed, heavyset man with a CIGAR in his mouth,
accompanied by a couple of BODYGUARDS, is showing off a crate of
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS to a couple of REBELS in combat fatigues. They speak
in rapid SPANISH, examining the guns, sighting them, etc. XAVIER excuses
himself to answer a ringing CELL PHONE. He speaks with a vague European
ACCENT.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Acquisitions –</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal factory - day</strong>: WESLEY is on his cell
phone on the main FACTORY FLOOR. The place is a WRECK, as WORKERS clean
up the mess Catwoman made.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: This is supply. There’s been a slight
complication, my employer wishes to move up the exchange – tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Impossible – there are issues of transport,
available funds –</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: We’re willing to adjust the price. But if
you can’t pick up the goods tomorrow, we’ll have to take our business
elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: This isn’t your first ‘complication.’</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: WESLEY waves to ANGEL at the controls of
a FORKLIFT – Angel still has dried flecks of MAKE-UP on his skin. He
pulls forward, ready to load the YP-3 into a waiting TRUCK.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It’ll be eliminated, like the others. We
just don’t want to take any chances.</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - day</strong>: ON TV, AN ARTIST’S
RENDITION of CATWOMAN, made to look far more menacing and mean.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Catwoman has struck again –</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: This costumed criminal has now added
murder to her resume of mischief and mayhem…</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: – she attacked us for no reason! And her
outfit, I mean, that whole S &amp; M thing is so 90s –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Just me –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh my God. Our date…</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Way to cover.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Catwoman. Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I – I’ll only be a minute.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: By the way, last night – you didn’t happen to
see or hear anything – my apartment was broken into.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No, sorry – I never look out the
window.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Weird, they didn’t take anything, just broke a
bottle of after-shave and slashed a picture of my sister.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Your sister, that’s – – really a
shame.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: What’s Yersinia Pestis?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Bubonic plague.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Bubonic plague? Why are you – ?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It’s sort of a hobby of mine…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh, I had kind of a kinky boyfriend
once.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Where should we eat?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I dunno… you like sushi?</p>
<p><strong>int. sushi bar - day</strong>: A WAITER comes through a
BEADED CURTAIN, passing LONE and PATIENCE seated nearby, drinks before
them. The curtain RATTLES after him, distracting PATIENCE.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: So what’ve you been up to lately?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Me? Oh. Not much. You know, sitting around
my apartment, watching television.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Is that so hard to believe? What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Catwoman.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: It’s the case I’ve been working on.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh yeah. I guess I heard about it.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I’m not surprised. Talk about your media
circus.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Well, she is interesting, isn’t she? Kind
of a… colorful character?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: She’s a thief and a killer.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I don’t believe that. I mean – whatever
happened to innocent until proven guilty?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Guess I went a little crazy ordering.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: It’s refreshing. A lot of women won’t let a
man see them eat.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Right, then we go home and binge on
Haagan-Dazs.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: During the following, Lone meticulously
mixes soy sauce and wasabi, uses chopsticks, etc. Patience simply peels
the fish off the rice and pops it in her mouth, as if eating potato
chips, then licking her fingers like a cat licking its paw.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You do hide things, don’t you. You may seem
all sweet and shy, but you’ve got a secret wild side.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Women in general, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Right. Women in general… You know, I actually
saw Catwoman the other night. From a distance. Goofy costume.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Really? I heard it was… sexy.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: In a way.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: So it could be sexier… with what, maybe a
wide belt?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Why so interested?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: You brought it up.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You want that toro?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: No no, it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>ext. riverside area - day</strong>: LONE and PATIENCE walk
close together, near the water.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Gonna have to get back to the station, I’m
working nights.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Catwoman again?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Afraid so. But I have a feeling she’ll be in
custody within the week.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Individuals who feel compelled to act out
through an animal alter-ego – bats, birds, bugs, there have been a
number of cases in other cities – they catch themselves. Take too many
risks, think they can play with the cops. See, they like to be
watched…</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Sorry. Seems like all I can do is talk about
work.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: So stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LONE jerks away, looking back over his
shoulder –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I’m really sorry, I don’t know what got
into me, I – I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Patience, wait –</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - living room - dusk</strong>: PATIENCE is
breathing hard, blinking rapidly, as she paces Edna’s floor. Edna
follows nervously, trying to calm her.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It’s happening, it’s happening again. It’s
not even dark yet – you said she could only come out at night!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: I didn’t say that! Patience, you made these
rules up yourself – a cat is a cat 24 hours a day, they just go hunting
at night –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: And she’s after Georges Avenal – if she
finds him, she’s going to kill him, I know it –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Stop talking about her like she’s someone
else! She’s you!</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Edna, you’ve gotta… tie me up or
something, lock me in the attic –</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: I don’t have an attic –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: A closet, the pantry, something! Please…
we have to keep the cat in tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ext./int. edna’s home - storm cellar - night</strong>: EDNA
stands in the opening of the angled storm cellar doorway, looking down
the stairs sadly.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Sure you don’t need a blanket, dear?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Just… lock… the door.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I’m not a bad person… I’m not a killer…
I’m not evil… not like Georges Aaavenal…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: He’s a murderer… he did this to me… it’s
all his fault.</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: He has to die.</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - living room - night</strong>: AN UNEARTHLY
HOWL ECHOES throughout the place from heater vents in the floor. In
response, THE CATS go nuts – prowling, pacing, bouncing off the walls,
picking up the CRY.</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - dining room - night</strong>: EDNA sits at
her table over a simple meal, attempts to read a CAT FANCY MAGAZINE, but
it’s pretty hopeless. She shuts her eyes, covers her ears.</p>
<p><strong>ext. edna’s home &amp; neighbor’s home - night</strong>: The
sour NEIGHBOR pokes her head out an OPEN WINDOW.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Edna, I’ve had it with your damn cats! I’m
calling the cops!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Midnight! Shoo!</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Edna? Edna, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Yes, dear, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Edna, it worked. I think… I think I’ve
beaten her. I’m Patience again. I’ve won.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Oh, I’m so glad…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Sucker.</p>
<p><strong>int. concert hall - night</strong>: A BALLET in progress –
“Giselle.” Lithe DANCERS spin gracefully across the stage, a rustic
village setting. FIND a HIGH BOX to one side. GEORGES and DRINA, in
formal clothes. GEORGES is absorbed in the performance, DRINA looks
bored, wrinkles her nose.</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: What is this about?</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Ssh. Giselle is mistreated by a cruel
prince and kills herself. Later, the souls of betrayed women come back
from the grave for revenge.</p>
<p><strong>ext. city street - concert hall - night</strong>: BALLET
MUSIC CONTINUES OVER. A CITY BUS passes, an AD FOR AVENAL on the side –
it’s been VANDALIZED, CLAW MARKS across the length of it. CRANE UP to
find CATWOMAN crouched on the roof of the bus. She leaps off from the
still-moving bus – – onto the ROOF of a TAXI passing the other way – –
and finally landing at the curb near – A classical-looking CONCERT HALL,
FOUNTAINS in front. CATWOMAN creeps amongst bushes, approaching the
building. Numerous COPS patrol the entrance – no way to get past
them.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Those things’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: IN THE BUSHES, CATWOMAN straddles ANGEL,
bangs his head against a cement curb.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: YP-3 – the plague – what’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I have no idea what you’re –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Tell me about Xavier Bartok.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: How do you know –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I’m asking the questions.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I – I can’t tell you –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Then it’s time to brush up on your
Braille.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: No, no, not my eyes! Xavier, he’s the one
who’s buying the stuff!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: The deal goes down tomorrow night – at the
Avenal offices –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Wrong. Your boss won’t live to see it.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CATWOMAN moves around the side of the
building, keeping low, ducking behind parked cars. Fewer COPS here, but
the place looks impregnable, no way to scale the walls. She tries an
EMERGENCY DOOR – locked, no good. She hisses in frustration, starts to
move on when – THE DOOR OPENS behind her. CATWOMAN spins to see –
LAUREL, her face hidden with dark glasses and a wide-brimmed hat. She
gestures frantically. Catwoman darts inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. concert hall - basement - night</strong>: LAUREL whips
off the hat and glasses, gives a girly hug to Catwoman, who pulls back
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I knew you’d come.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: He’s with his bimbo in a box to the right of
the stage. But there’s all kinds of security – he’s pretty scared of
you.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: He should be. How much do you know about
your husband’s operation?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I know he’s built an empire out of women’s
inadequacy and self-hatred –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Yeah, yeah, but the secret ingredient in
his face cream – it’s black plague bacteria. He’s selling it to an arms
dealer.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: And he’s committed murder to protect his
secret.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Nothing he does would surprise me anymore.
He’s a monster. You should’ve seen the pre-nup, I don’t get a dime –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I’ll take it from here.</p>
<p><strong>int. concert hall - hallway - night</strong>: CATWOMAN slinks
along a hallway, past a couple of bored young USHERS. They give her a
sidelong look. UNIFORM COPS are clustered near a FORMAL STAIRCASE,
blocking her access to the right-hand side of the hall. CATWOMAN bares
her teeth in frustration. She hurries toward a VELVET ROPE, the sign,
“BOXES - PRIVATE.” She slips past the rope, moves to a far door.</p>
<p><strong>int. concert hall - night</strong>: AN OLD COUPLE SNORE
through the ballet. CATWOMAN appears behind them in the box, snatches
OPERA GLASSES from the woman’s lap and scans the hall – HER POV, ZOOMING
from box to box – finding GEORGES in a box on the opposite side of the
hall. DRINA is rising, heading out the door. CATWOMAN climbs up the
CURTAINS around the box, levering herself upward to the elaborate FRIEZE
that wraps around the top of the hall – GREEK GODS in various dramatic
poses. WIDER, FROM BELOW, as CATWOMAN climbs and creeps near the
ceiling, moving over the PROSCENIUM ARCH above the stage, heading toward
GEORGES. A POLICEMAN at ground level spots her – he lifts a radio to his
lips, calling for backup.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: WITH GEORGES, still absorbed in the
ballet. Suddenly CATWOMAN lands in the empty seat beside him, staring at
the stage herself. A whisper:</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I love this part.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Let’s not be interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Red’s a good color on you.</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: No – please –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I could rip out your throat…</p>
<p><strong>georges</strong>: Why – why kill me?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Because you deserve it. And because I
can.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: C’mon honey… just do it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CATWOMAN releases him, throws him
GASPING to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Damn it. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>int. concert hall - backstage - night</strong>: MUSIC
CONTINUES as CATWOMAN darts between stored PROPS and FLATS from a
GRAVEYARD SCENE, bowling over costumed DANCERS. Seeing POLICEMEN
blocking an exit, she dodges between DROPS, scrambles up a FLY-LINE –
POLICE track her from below – she leaps between sandbagged ROPES as the
BAGS drop, scrambling higher onto the GRID –</p>
<p><strong>int. concert hall - night</strong>: ON STAGE, inappropriate
SCRIMS and PROPS descend and rise again. DANCERS dodge and weave as a
GIANT GARBAGE CAN descends in the midst of the VILLAGE SQUARE.</p>
<p><strong>int. concert hall - backstage - night</strong>: CATWOMAN
darts effortlessly across the overhead grid, when –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TOM LONE, anticipating her move, has
climbed a ladder to the grid. He trains a gun on her – CATWOMAN freezes.
She stares at him, breathing hard, taking a moment to come to grips with
this adversary. LONE advances on her, stepping gingerly.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You’re under arrest –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Tag, you’re it.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Handcuffs. Yummy.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You play rough.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: This isn’t a game.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Lone has too much momentum, he loses
balance, about to go over the edge – CATWOMAN swings back like a
pendulum, wrapping her legs around his neck, saving him from falling.
She swings him back over the platform, tries to kick him off, but he
grabs her legs, pulling her and SNAPPING THE CABLE – STAGE LIGHTS go
out, ELECTRICAL SPARKS fly as they hit the platform together, she lands
straddling him, catching the SPARKING CABLE just before it strikes the
mesh.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Be careful! That thing hits the metal, we’re
both fried!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I knew there was a spark between us.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Please, it’s our first date. I wouldn’t
want the mystery to go out of our relationship.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: We don’t have a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You men love the chase, but once you catch
us, you always lose interest.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LONE rises, tries to pull Catwoman to
her feet – but he comes up with an empty, dangling HANDCUFF. From the
ground, CATWOMAN plants a kick in his back from behind, he falls forward
and SLAMS his FACE HARD into a LIGHT RIG. Catwoman winces, sounding a
lot like Patience:</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: And here I thought we were hitting it
off…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Show of hands – who can see in the
dark?</p>
<p><strong>ext. concert hall - stage door &amp; side street -
night</strong>: A SIDE DOOR swings open and CATWOMAN darts out. She’s
almost home free when SHOTS RING OUT behind her – ANGEL, staggering out
from the bushes where she clocked him, FIRES his handgun after her.
CATWOMAN stumbles and rolls, but keeps moving.</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - bedroom - night</strong>: EDNA holds a few
CATS in her arms, WEEPING quietly, tissue close at hand. There’s a sound
of SCRATCHING at the window, she moves to open it, revealing – CATWOMAN,
exhausted and bruised from her battle. She crawls in the window, as Edna
stares in astonishment.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Patience?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Oh dear. You’ve been shot.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: It’s nothing to cry about.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: No, it’s my cats. Last night, all that noise –
the neighbors complained. Animal Control says they’re a health
hazard…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Piss on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: They’re coming tomorrow to take them away,
have them destroyed –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: It won’t happen. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Did you do it? Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I wanted to – but I couldn’t. I actually…
felt sorry for him.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Because you’re still Patience Price.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Don’t remind me. That girl is so weak.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: No, she isn’t. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I could really use a nap.</p>
<p><strong>ext. patience’s building - day</strong>: PATIENCE, in
borrowed clothes, moves toward the entrance of her building, limping and
tired. She climbs the steps.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Patience.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh! Hi. Listen– about last night…</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Forget it. I, um… listen, I’m sorry about
this.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He takes a few steps back as – – a PAIR
OF PATROL CARS SCREECH to a halt, coming up on the sidewalk in front of
Patience’s building. COPS armed with SHOTGUNS leap out, train their
weapons on her.</p>
<p><strong>patrol cop</strong>: Hands in the air!</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Patience Price, AKA Catwoman, you’re under
arrest. You have the right to remain silent…</p>
<p><strong>ext. edna’s home - day</strong>: Grim-looking ANIMAL CONTROL
WORKERS methodically ferry CAT CAGES from Edna’s open front door to a
VAN in front. EDNA scurries helplessly from cage to cage, saying
goodbye, fighting back tears. MIDNIGHT slashes at a WORKER and escapes.
But a KITTEN, less agile, is shoved into a CAGE. As the DOOR SLAMS SHUT
–</p>
<p><strong>int. police station - interrogation room - day</strong>:
PATIENCE is in a JAIL JUMPSUIT, alone in a small, dingy room with the
usual one-way mirror and table. THE DOOR is opened by a COP and LONE
enters.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: This is all a mistake – Tom, you know
me!</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: One thing you learn in this line of work – you
never really know anybody, not completely. You’re being charged with
vandalism, burglary and the murder of Doctor Ivan Nevski –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: He was dead when… um, Ivan who? You, you
have no proof that I – what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: These scratches were inflicted last night by
Catwoman. Forensics also tested this scratch –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: They were made by the same implement.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: So this whole time, you’ve been flirting,
buying me dinner, acting like you were interested – I was a suspect? It
was just some cat and mouse thing?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: No, not at first – I really bought the act,
vulnerable girl all alone in the big city –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Sorry if I don’t fit into your damsel in
distress fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: That’s not what –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Real people are a little more
complicated.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Look, I didn’t want to believe it, but –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I guess a strong woman can be intimidating
to a certain kind of man –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Did you really think I wasn’t gonna recognize
you in a little mask? I’m not blind.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: So if they don’t need rescuing, you better
lock them up yourself –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Knock it off. It’ll go a lot easier on you if
you just confess now.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I’ve been doing some investigating of my
own. A real crime. Georges Avenal is stockpiling YP-3, a variant of
black plague bacteria –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Oh yes, your little hobby. Please, Patience
–</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It’s a bioweapon! Ivan Nevski developed
it, they must’ve killed him to keep it a secret –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: So now you’ve constructed a paranoid fantasy
with your former boss at the center. A disgruntled employee –</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: The deal’s going down tonight, they’re
meeting an arms dealer named Xavier Bartok at the Avenal offices –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: You’re hallucinating. Georges Avenal is world
famous, worth millions, a respected businessman – why in God’s name
would he get involved in arms trafficking?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I don’t know! Why don’t you ask him?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Enough. Are you denying you’re Catwoman?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: It doesn’t matter what I say. You’ll make
me whoever you want me to be.</p>
<p><strong>int. police station - patience’s cell - evening</strong>:
PATIENCE paces in her own CELL, talking to herself:</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Damn it, it’s getting dark out, where are
you…?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: I am Catwoman… I am…</p>
<p><strong>int. church - night</strong>: A gloriously handsome GROOM
stands beside a VEILED BRIDE at an altar. ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS. A REVEREND
beams at the couple, nods at the young man, who throws back the veil –
the bride is DRINA – caught CRACKING a piece of CHEWING GUM. An O.S.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Cut!</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: I wasn’t ready!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: We’re gonna be at this all night.</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: Line?!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: ‘I do. With Beaunique.’</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: It’s Detective Lone, apparently they’ve
caught the Catwoman.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: He’s coming by later, says he wants to
ask you about another matter.</p>
<p><strong>int. police station - patience’s cell - night</strong>: ON
PATIENCE, lying in her bunk, miserable. We hear the sound of a CAT
CRYING, distant, almost as if it were in her head. She opens her eyes to
see – MIDNIGHT, mostly in shadow, pacing on the other side of a high,
mesh-covered window. ON PATIENCE, for a moment we see the GOLD,
ELLIPTICAL PUPILS. WIDER, Patience – now CATWOMAN – springs to her feet
and studies the BARS of her cell. As she did at the zoo, she begins to
ease her body between them…</p>
<p><strong>int. police station - bullpen - night</strong>: Rows of
desks, PLAINCLOTHES and UNIFORM COPS in a bustling, crowded bullpen
area, a hive of activity. PATIENCE/CATWOMAN enters in her JAIL JUMPSUIT
– she can’t fight her way through, so she tries a different approach.
She moves stealthily through the room, using her heightened reflexes to
avoid being seen. It’s an intricate choreography of split-second timing,
turned heads and diverted glances. She ducks down to crouch as a CART
PASSES… A PLAINCLOTHES COP spins idly in his swivel chair,
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN circles behind him…. PATIENCE/ CATWOMAN rolls a signed
BASEBALL across a desktop, knocking over a PENCIL CUP. As the ASSISTANT
bends to retrieve it, PATIENCE/CATWOMAN steps lightly over her desk – –
and makes it OUT THE DOOR.</p>
<p><strong>ext. rooftops/city streets - night</strong>: THE FULL MOON
just above the rooftops. CATWOMAN rises INTO FRAME in full regalia,
silhouetted, then LEAPS away.</p>
<p><strong>int. animal control - night</strong>: MOVE from a reversed
WINDOW SIGN to a SKYLIGHT above – CATWOMAN leaps through it and lands on
the floor in a SHOWER of glass. She hurries towards the KENNELS.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: DOZENS OF CATS behind bars. CATWOMAN
flings the cages open, the grateful CATS stream out.</p>
<p><strong>int. church - night</strong>: CAMERA ROLLS ON DRINA and the
GROOM at the altar. IN b.g., we glimpse a DARK FIGURE, moving low
between the nearby PEWS.</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: With Beauni –</p>
<p><strong>drina</strong>: No! I just had this fixed!</p>
<p><strong>ext. city streets - night</strong>: THE DARK MERCEDES, with
only ONE HEADLIGHT, and a DENTED FRONT END, weaves quickly around slower
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She hits a SPEED-DIAL button, we hear a
phone RINGING as she PEELS off the CAT MASK – and a WIG… it’s LAUREL
AVENAL. We hear XAVIER’S VOICE:</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Are we on?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh honey, we are so on.</p>
<p><strong>int. church - night</strong>: CHAOS, PARAMEDICS, COPS, a
FORENSICS TEAM photographing George’s corpse. Nearby, other COPS bag the
HANDGUN. TOM LONE is here, on his cell phone, heading for the exit.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Yeah, we got a couple dozen witnesses, it was
Catwoman. Looks like it might be the same weapon that killed Nevski…</p>
<p><strong>ext. church - night</strong>: LONE moves outside, past FILM
TRUCKS outside this urban church, still on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Nah, couldn’t have been Price after all, musta
been a lab error. You better cut her loose right away or she’s gonna
have a hell of a lawsuit on her hands… yeah, be there soon, I just gotta
tie up a couple loose ends.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - night</strong>: LONE’S SEDAN pulls up near
the entrance to the office tower. As he gets out, he hears a CHOPPER
coming in overhead and looks up to see – The AVENAL BEAUTY sign high
above, a TWIN-ROTOR CHOPPER approaching the helipad.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LONE moves toward the showroom entrance,
tries the door – locked. He sees the entrance to the PARKING GARAGE,
moves down the ramp.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - helipad - night</strong>: THE MILITARY CARGO
CHOPPER touches down. XAVIER and FOUR MERCENARIES emerge. Two mercs
carry ALUMINUM SUITCASES, all are armed with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. In
addition to chopper SOUNDS, there’s a WHISTLING WIND up here and the
WHITE NOISE ROAR of A.C. DUCTS. LAUREL, still in the cat suit but
without the mask, is waiting. XAVIER approaches, a small BRIEFCASE in
hand. Laurel’s manner is cold, professional, all business – she couldn’t
be more different from the victimized female we met up here at the
outset.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Your husband?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: He won’t be a problem. Ever again. And I’m
not even a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: American women. I’m always impressed.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Let’s do some business.</p>
<p><strong>ext. skyscraper rooftop - night</strong>: THE REAL CATWOMAN.
She paces, breathing hard, steeling herself for something, looking
toward the Avenal building. A WINDOW WASHER RIG hangs halfway down the
building, but it’s quite a distance from this roof edge.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I can do this… right?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She’s addressing MIDNIGHT, who
non-commitally licks a paw. CATWOMAN moves to the far end of the roof
and sprints toward the edge, leaps for all she’s worth – CATWOMAN sails
through the air in a perfect arc, toward the window-washer rig… but
she’s going to fall short and plunge twenty stories. At the last second,
she pulls out her whip and snaps it out around – – the cables of the
rig. CATWOMAN SLAMS HARD against the side of the building, dangling from
the whip.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - penthouse - night</strong>: An ALUMINUM
SUITCASE opens – STACKS of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. WIDER, WESLEY handles
the suitcase. He starts to count the stacks of money, testing random
bills with a COUNTERFEIT PEN. Meanwhile, Xavier’s MERCS are moving aside
the LADDERS and PAINT CANS. One yanks down the frilly DRAPERIES to
reveal – CANISTERS OF YP-3, dozens of them in a cutout portion of wall,
more than we’ve seen before. Laurel’s been hiding them here all along.
Xavier opens his briefcase – there’s a TESTING KIT inside.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Avenal should think about getting out of
cosmetics altogether – chemical weapons are a growth industry.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Look what I found.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: He’s a cop. Found him sniffing around the
basement.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh beautiful. Put him in there for now…</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What are we going to do about this?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I’ll be flying over water. I could drop him
off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - night</strong>: AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING,
CATWOMAN holds a button on the WINDOW WASHER’S RIG, which rises toward
the roof.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - helipad - night</strong>: THE MERCS
methodically move canisters from the penthouse, up the stairs, to the
CHOPPER on the helipad, where a PILOT waits at the controls – the ROTOR
BLADES spin lazily. MERCENARY #1, winded, calls to the PILOT, who’s
absorbed in a copy of SOLDIER OF FORTUNE:</p>
<p><strong>mercenary #1</strong>: Wanna pitch in?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Not my job.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You cow…</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - penthouse - night</strong>: WESLEY slips a
few BUNDLES of BILLS into his pocket and CLOSES an ALUMINUM CASE.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It’s all here. I’ve taken my cut.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: All right, Wesley.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: Cuban. Aren’t these illegal?</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - helipad - night</strong>: MERCENARIES #3 and
#4 are in the back of the chopper, securing the canisters. #1 and #2
head toward the stairs, for another load. MERCENARY #1, in the rear,
passes a low A.C. DUCT. THE WHIP LASHES out from behind him, wraps
around his throat – he can’t cry out as it YANKS him back behind the
duct. We hear a nasty THUNK. One down. ON THE STAIRS, MERCENARY #2 turns
around.</p>
<p><strong>mercenary #2</strong>: Tony…?</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - penthouse garden - night</strong>: XAVIER
and LAUREL have their backs to the stairs, SMOKING their CIGARS, as the
unconscious MERCENARY hits the ground a short distance behind them. They
don’t notice. Laurel stretches her arms luxuriously, enjoying the feel
of the wind. Xavier studies Laurel, a bit lasciviously.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Free at last… to eat what I want, wear what
I want, look like a slob if I want… You have no idea how good it
feels.</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: I was thinking after this business is over,
you might spend some time with me on my island –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Thanks, no. I’m through with men.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - helipad - night</strong>: MERCENARIES #3 and
#4 emerge from the chopper, looking around for the others. As they start
to circle the chopper – – CATWOMAN swings around from behind them,
hanging from the slowly spinning ROTOR BLADE, she KICKS THEM BOTH from
behind and sends them flying head-first to the asphalt. Merc #3 is
knocked cold, Merc #4 rolls over on the ground, FIRING A BURST behind
him. But when the blade comes around again, she’s gone. He has no idea
what hit them.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - penthouse garden - night</strong>: LAUREL
and XAVIER both react to the GUNFIRE, dropping their cigars, hurrying
for the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - helipad - night</strong>: THE PILOT leaps
out, a HANDGUN ready.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: What the hell are you shooting at?</p>
<p><strong>mercenary #4</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - penthouse garden - night</strong>: WESLEY
and ANGEL have emerged from the penthouse, alarmed, just as LAUREL and
XAVIER nearly trip over the groaning</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What the hell –?</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - helipad - night</strong>: LAUREL and XAVIER
reach the top of the stairs, followed by WESLEY and ANGEL, just as –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CATWOMAN leaps down to the penthouse
level from the helipad. The group is stunned to see the injured men.
MERCENARY #1 is crawling out from behind the A.C. DUCT. LAUREL angrily
grabs a MACHINE GUN from the dazed MERCENARY #3. To Xavier:</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Where did you find these clowns?!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: If it’s all right with you, Laurel, I’d just
as soon be going…</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: These are good soldiers. It would take a
team of men –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Or one woman.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Look what I found!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Don’t shoot, you idiots! She’ll drop the
money–</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Henchmen, Laurel? How tacky.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She jerks one of the cases – the latch
has been loosened, it POPS OPEN and CASH GOES FLYING into the wind –
DRIFTING from the rooftop to the city streets below. LAUREL reacts in
agony.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: No, please– don’t do that again!</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Don’t you hate it when somebody shows up
at a party wearing the same dress?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Let’s face it – we’re alike, you and me.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: You guys gotta be careful with this YP-3
stuff. It’s a living thing, you know, a bacteria. If it gets too hot –
it dies.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Let’s split the rest of the money – and
there’s more where that came from –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Tempting offer… We would make a pretty
good team. Beyond the law, fighting the yoke of male oppression, sisters
under the skin…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Nah, I still have to live with myself.</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - penthouse garden - dawn</strong>: LAUREL
hurries down the stairs to the garden, FIRING at – CATWOMAN, as she
darts into the penthouse. Catwoman’s nearly hit, showered with broken
glass.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - laurel’s penthouse - dawn</strong>: The roof
CREAKS ominously, the room is thick with SMOKE. LAUREL charges in, sees
movement near THE ELEVATOR and FIRES</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Sorry, Angel.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - showroom - dawn</strong>: WESLEY, XAVIER and
his MERCS hurry from the elevators. They’ve almost made it out the exit
to safety when an EERIE HOWL erupts –</p>
<p><strong>xavier</strong>: What is tha –</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - penthouse - day</strong>: CATWOMAN and
LAUREL continue their battle. Catwoman gets Laurel down, near victory,
when – BEAMS OF SUNLIGHT from the window penetrate the SMOKE and catch
CATWOMAN full in the face. She backs away, squinting, disoriented – this
gives Laurel the chance to recover.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: No – I need more time –</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: Tom…</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You know this guy?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: No! Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Why not? He’s just – a man.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Move a muscle and you won’t have a date for
the prom.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: It’s amazing. We’re the stronger sex – but
men are like Kryptonite. They make us so weak…</p>
<p><strong>catwoman/patience</strong>: Stop it, please – you’ll kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Don’t worry, I know exactly how much a man
can take.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You know, I was actually starting to admire
you.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: When I think of all the guys I had to…
use.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: And there you were, clawing your way up on
your own. But you let me down.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I ask one little favor – but no, I had to
take care of Georges myself. And now… this. You’ve ruined
everything.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: No… it’s impossible… you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh my God… it was you…</p>
<p><strong>flashback - ext. patience’s building</strong>: OBJECTIVE
SHOT, ANGEL near Patience’s body. CAMERA MOVES TO the MERCEDES. The
DRIVER’S DOOR opens and LAUREL steps out, looking at Patience’s body on
the ground with disgust.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: You were behind the wheel that night…</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - penthouse - day</strong>: PATIENCE leaps at
LAUREL with blinding speed, CLAWS OUT.</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: It was you!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What do you want, an apology? Of course it
was me, it was always me – I ran the YP-3 operation right under Georges’
nose, I couldn’t let some frumpy accountant blow the whistle when I was
so close –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: No! My face!</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: So I’m not the only one hiding
behind a mask.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I was the first to try Beaunique – I was
over 30, I had nothing to lose. When the symptoms started to show, it
was too late…</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: So you upped production and sold
the stuff to an arms dealer.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Life hands you lemons, you make
lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN runs to Lone’s side,
pulling him away from the spreading flames toward the ELEVATOR. She
SLASHES the tape that binds his wrists. LAUREL, meanwhile, opens a
hidden COMPARTMENT by her mirror, revealing numerous LATEX MASKS. She
begins to apply a new one, using adhesive, smoothing wrinkles, hiding
the seams, etc. Nearby, her PORTRAIT starts to MELT and turn to ASH. THE
CEILING BUCKLES, chunks of MASONRY falling. PATIENCE/CATWOMAN is prying
open the elevator doors.</p>
<p><strong>patience/catwoman</strong>: Laurel, you better get out of
here –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: In a minute – I have to finish putting on my
face</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - elevator shaft - day</strong>:
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN leaps into the open elevator shaft, LONE has his arms
around her – together they slide down a CABLE as FLAMES ERUPT from
above.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - laurel’s penthouse - day</strong>: LAUREL is
now trapped in the make-up alcove, illuminated by flames surrounding
her, but she doesn’t seem to care, working frantically to get a new face
on. She whispers a mantra:</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You’re still beautiful… you’ll always be
beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - day</strong>: POLICE charge into the
building from a number of COP CARS. As they do so, we see the ARMY OF
CATS fleeing.</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - showroom - day</strong>: WESLEY, XAVIER and
the MERCS are on the ground, SCRATCHED and BLEEDING. They raise their
hands for the puzzled, gun- wielding COPS.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Thank God you’re here…</p>
<p><strong>int. avenal hq - parking garage - day</strong>: ELEVATOR
DOORS OPEN in this parking garage. PATIENCE/ CATWOMAN pulls LONE out, he
seems woozy, his arms around her neck. They collapse together against a
wall. She tears the DUCT TAPE off Lone’s mouth. He winces.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ext. avenal hq - day</strong>: OVERHEAD ANGLE as COPS hustle
XAVIER and the OTHERS into police vehicles. CAMERA KEEPS PULLING UP,
until we see the ruined ROOF of the building, IN FLAMES. The “A” in
“AVENAL BEAUTY” has been knocked out by the conflagration … for a few
moments the sign reads “VENAL BEAUTY,” until the whole thing EXPLODES
and SPARKS OUT.</p>
<p><strong>int. edna’s home - living room - day</strong>: EDNA lies on
the couch, a hand over her eyes, asleep in a robe. She stirs as a TONGUE
laps at her face. As she sits up, dozens of CATS are all over her,
begging for attention. She laughs and cries at the same time then sees –
CATWOMAN, masked again, who has entered behind the cats.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: A promise is a promise.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman</strong>: I found out the truth.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: But the sun is up… you’re still Catwoman?</p>
<p><strong>catwoman/patience</strong>: Yeah. But I’m Patience, too… with
or without the mask. I don’t think there’s a difference any more.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Maybe there never really was.</p>
<p><strong>int. patience’s apartment - day</strong>: Filled with
CARDBOARD BOXES. MOVING MEN carry a few out. SALLY is ostensibly lending
a hand, but is mostly interested in the men’s muscles. As she picks up a
tiny box –</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You look awfully hot. Sure you don’t wanna
take that shirt off?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Hi, Patience.</p>
<p><strong>int. lone’s apartment - day</strong>: He and Patience
maintain eye contact while they speak.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Moving out?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: You are a good detective. It just feels
like time for a change.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Where you heading?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Why? You still keeping tabs on me? Said on
TV the Catwoman case was closed.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Mm. No hard feelings…?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Nah. In a way, it was flattering.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Funny thing, no one at the station remembers
letting you out of jail.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: That’s bureaucracy for you. Hard to
believe, Catwoman was Laurel Avenal all along.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: Uh-huh. It is pretty hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: There’s a significant pause, they eye
each other across the alley. Lone knows, and Patience knows he knows. In
unison:</p>
<p><strong>patience lone</strong>: Thank you – Thank you –</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Dinner the other night. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: For… teaching me some things. Listen, Patience
- - if you’re still interested – I’d like to get to know you better.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Hey, you never really know anybody. Not
completely.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I guess I had that coming… Look, I know it’s
not simple, I’m a cop and you’re…</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: A dull accountant.</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: All I’m saying is – whatever you are, however…
complicated – I can deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Can you?</p>
<p><strong>lone</strong>: I’d like to try. I just don’t want this to be
good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>patience</strong>: Oh… I have a feeling we’ll see each other
again.</p>
