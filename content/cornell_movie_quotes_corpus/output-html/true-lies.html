<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Roger that. Hey, Fize! Get your butt in here.
Harry’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Switching to sub-vocal. Gib, you copy?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: It’s Talkradio. You’re on the air.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This needs more garlic.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There’s Daddy Petrobucks.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Modem in place. Transmitting… now.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Affirmatory. We are in.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: These are encrypted files, guys. This is
going to take me a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Where’s the john around here? I have to take
a major leak.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Magnificent, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes. Hi, I’m Juno Skinner. I thought I knew
most of Khaled’s friends but I don’t believe I know you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Renquist. Harry Renquist.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Skinner. Skinner. Come on…</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Juno Skinner. Art and antiquities dealer,
specializing in ancient Persia.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is Persian, if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Very good. It’s sixth century B.C. Do you like
the period?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I adore it.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry, we got a problem. Guards are swarming
all over the dock.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you dance, Ms. Skinner?</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Okay, files are unlocked. I’m in. I’m down,
baby. I got my hand up her dress and I’m going for the gold. I’m–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Just copy the goddamn files! Harry, don’t be
stopping to smell the roses, now. You hear me, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Well. And I thought this was going to be just
another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry, seconds count, buddy. Ditch the bitch,
let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Unfortunately, Juno, I have a plane to
catch.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Call me, if you’d like to see some of my other
pieces.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Son of a bitch is with her two minutes and
she’s ready to bear his children What’s your exit strategy Twinkle
Toes?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: May I see your invitation, sir?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here’s my invitation.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Aw, shit. Here we go–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry, what’s your twenty? I need a position,
buddy–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Uh… right! I’ll catch you on the next bend.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry! Where are you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In the helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: He’s in the helicopter.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry? HARRY?!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s go. We can still make our flight.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: This is GREAT!! I never get to shoot!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Empty. Go.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry Tasker wallet. Harry Tasker passport.
Plane ticket stub, hotel receipt, Tasker. Two postcards of Lake Geneva.
House keys. Souvenir snowing Swiss village.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s this for?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: For Dana, schmuck. Bring your kid something.
You know. The dad thing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Got it. Nice touch. Okay, pick me up at
eight. The de-brief is at ten hundred.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Hey, hey, hey… what are we forgetting?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What a team. See you at eight.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Yep. Sleep fast.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi, honey. How was the flight?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Fine, honey. Stay asleep.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Hey, thanks dad. I never had one of these.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You better hurry. You’re going to be late for
school.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Really lame.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dana, don’t forget to feed Gizmo!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How’d it go at the trade show? You make all
the other salesmen jealous?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. You should have seen it. We were the
hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680…
how you can write up an order and the second the customer’s name goes
into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they’ve
ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s fabulous Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, it was wild.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Come any closer I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The plumber came yesterday. He said they have
to dig under the slab or something and it’s going to be six hundred
dollars to fix.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh huh. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s not okay. It’s extortion.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good thinking, honey.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Hi, kid.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Hey, Gib. What up?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks dear.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Here, check these out.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: The CCD camera and transmitter and inside a
pack of smokes. Slick little unit, huh?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dana!!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Can’t stop, I’m late. Bye, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Kids. Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of
misery.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She knows not to steal. I’ve taught her
better than that.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Yeah, but you’re not her parents, anymore, you
and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you
spend a day with her can’t compete with that kind of constant
bombardment. You’re outgunned, amigo.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Morning, Mr. Tasker.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Morning, Charlene.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: See, kids now are ten years ahead of where we
were at the same age. You probably think she’s still a virgin–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous. She’s only – how old is
she?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Fourteen, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Right. She’s only fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Uh huh. And her little hormones are going like
a fire alarm. I say even money that physicist on the bike is boinkin’
her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No way. Not Dana.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Okay. Okay. De-nail ain’t just a river in
Egypt. She’s probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Will you just open the door!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Or drugs.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Twenty here, fifty there… I figured my wife’s
boyfriend was taking it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I thought you moved out.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Well . . . I moved back in. My lawyer said it
would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.
Don’t change the subject… you owe me two hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Gentlemen, please idenitify yourselves to
the scanner.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Harry Tasker. One zero zero two four.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Albert Gibson. Three four nine nine one.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Thank you. You are cleared.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us
in?</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Ten, Mr. Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: And you still reach for your piece every
time.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: God! You have no idea how much that turns me
on. I’ve never had the courage to say this before but… I love you,
Janice.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You better watch it. She might file on you
for sexual harassment.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: In her dreams.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, Fize. We’re late for our
butt-grinding.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Jesus, Harry! You guys really screwed the
pooch last night. Please tell me how I can look at this, that it’s not a
total pooch- screw.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Total is a strong word–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: There are degrees of totality.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: It’s a scale really, with “perfect mission”
on one end and “total pooch-screw” on the other and we’re more about
here–</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Faisil. You’re new on Harry’s team, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: So what makes you think that the slack I cut
him in any way translates to you?!</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Sorry, sir. Uh… here’s what we got.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Jamal Khaled. We think he’s dirty so we raid
his financial files… Check it out…</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: One hundred million in wire transfers from
the COMMERCE BANK</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Which we all know is a front for certain
nations to fund terrorist activities. Something big is going down –</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: And we know that a week ago four MIRV
warheads were smuggled out of the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan .
. .</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We think Khaled’s group has bought the nukes
and is bringing them to U.S. soil.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: So far this is not blowing my skirt up,
gentleman. Do you have anything remotely substantial? Don’t be pumping
beets up my ass here. Do you have hard data?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not what you’d call rock hard.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: It’s pretty limp, actually.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Then perhaps you better get some … before
somebody parks a car in front of the White House with a nuclear weapon
in the trunk!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I mean, it’s not like he’s saving the world
or anything. He’s a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can’t get to
sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I’m out. But
he acts like he’s curing cancer or something.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: So I guess you didn’t get away for the
weekend after all?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Are you kidding? Harry had to go out of
town.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I’m shocked.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah. You know Harry.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Helen, have you pulled those files yet? I need
them by lunch.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I won’t let you down, Brad.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You little pencil-neck. So… yo… sista! D’you
do anything interesting?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Oh… Eric and I drove up to this little
romantic inn, and… pretty much lapped champagne out of each other’s
navels for two days.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You bitch.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Girlfriend, you got a man. You just have to
take control . . . set up the right mood.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Harry only has two moods: busy… and
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Then you better do something to jumpstart
that man’s motor. You know… wake up the sleeping giant of his
passion.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’ya got?</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Here, check this out–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: It’s a two million dollar disbursement from
Khaled to… Juno Skinner. Uh huh. The babe at the party.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It doesn’t mean anything. She buys
antiquities for Khaled.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Nope. The art buys are in a separate
ledger.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: And this is a little above market- rate for
the horizontal bop, even for a total biscuit like her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do
we know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Uh huh. Right here in river city.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here
the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has
offices here.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Sounds like a job for a specialist.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I need you to talk to Dana. The vice
principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll handle it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren’t you in
class today?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse’s
office, cause I had a headache.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You seem fine now.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Great! You’re going to believe that fat dweeb
Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not sure what to believe anymore, young
lady. You never used to lie to me. But lately you don’t seem to know the
difference between right and wrong.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dana, are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Yeah, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know you can always talk to me. Right?
Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Okay, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’d tell me if there was something wrong,
wouldn’t you, pumpkin?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I’m not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even
remotely like a pumpkin?! I’m not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear
either! And you don’t understand anything Dad…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: “I’ll handle it”.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: It’s all set up… ghost phones and fax, all the
usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist. Okay,
reality check. Go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi, I’m Harry Renquist. I own a–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: –corporate art consulting company in San
Francisco. I have an appointment with Ms. Skinner–</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Harry! I thought I might see you again. I just
didn’t except you to call so soon.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, what’s the point of waiting?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: So your clients want something for the lobby
of their new corporate headquarters?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s right. They want something… dramatic.
I spoke to a number of people who said you’re the one to see.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: So what did these… people… say about me
exactly?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s see… that you can read ancient Sanskrit
without having to sound out the words. And that other dealers and
archeologists don’t like you much.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Those wimps. It’s because I use my diplomatic
contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to
take a hike. I told you to move those crates an hour ago. Come on guys,
let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: You see, a lot of these pieces are from
ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia is twenty feet under the
sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria. Not the most popular places lately. So
I’ve had to become an expert in international diplomacy.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Well, do you see anything you like,
Mr. Renquist?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s importing stuff from all over the
mid-east.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: She could be moving money, guns. Anything.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: And the second you left there, we started
getting calls to the ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist
front.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay. Let’s step up the surveillance on her.
Put on two more guys.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Ms. Skinner? Can I speak to you for a moment
please, in your office?</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: You stupid undisciplined bitch!</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: It’s a good thing you pay me well.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Do you realize that there are surveillance
teams watching this place right now? Your phones are almost certainly
tapped. And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this
Renquist, who may be a–</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: No. He checked out okay–</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: That is for interrupting. And that is for
being wrong. We do not tolerate mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Find out who this Renquist it.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Use the gifts that Allah has given you.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hello, Tektel Systems. Mr. Tasker’s
office.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi, Charlene? It’s Helen. Is he there?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Harry’s in a sales meeting, Mrs. Tasker.
Let me try him in there. Hold please.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: It’s Helen.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi honey. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you
have to promise me that you’ll be home at eight. I don’t want Dana and I
sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Baby, I said I’d be there. Really. Trust me.
Gotta go, honey. Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hello? Oh, Juno, hi. Well sure. I can be
there in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What? It’s on the way. She says she’s got
something for me.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Hello, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Do you like my tomb? The museum financing fell
out, so I thought your clients might be interested.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s certainly… dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Especially in this light. This is the only
light they had then, so I like to study it this way. I love this place.
I love all ruins.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is that why you got into this business?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I’ve always been a collector at heart. When I
see something I want, I have to have it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And you have a reputation as someone who gets
what she wants.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry, this is your conscience speaking…</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Look at this. People who dies twenty centuries
ago.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: They breathed and loved and wept, just like
us. And now their ideals, their religions, their social orders… are gone
like mist. What did any of it matter?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: I only hope they lived well. That they got
what they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Getting what you want is the only important
thing.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry? Listen to the following code word.
Helen. H-E-L-E-N. Now, do you want me to I beep you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Yes what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh, yes, it is important.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh, it looks like I have to run. I’ll call
you tomorrow. Your proposal is very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: See.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: We have a friend. Five cars back, inside lane.
They’ve been on us since we left Juno’s.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Station wagon?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Uh huh. Want me to lose them?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. We need this lead. Unit Seven.</p>
<p><strong>unit seven</strong>: Seven here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I need you at the Georgetown mall in three
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>seven</strong>: Copy that. We’re rolling.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Helen’s going to be pissed.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: See, that’s the problem with terrorists.
They’re really inconsiderate when it comes to people’s schedules.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Test two three. Pull over here.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You don’t smoke, dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Gonna try to get a closer shot of Beavis
&amp; Butthead.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: There’s another guy, still in the car.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Stay on him.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Helen? Hi, it’s Gib. Harry remembered something
he left at the office. You know Harry.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah, Gib. I know Harry.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Out. If Dad doesn’t care enough about us to be
here on his birthday, then why should I care? I’m going to a movie.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No you’re not. You’re going to stay here
until your father gets home and have cake!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Mom, wake up! Dad barely knows we exist.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s not true, honey–</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: It is true! He doesn’t know anything about me.
He still thinks I’m like ten years old or something. As long as I just
smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy
daughter, he thinks everything’s fine. But it’s not fine. Nothing’s
fine.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dana! Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Oh shit. Harry, I lost the third guy.
Harry?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry? Harry, you copy?! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get back to the car!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Federal Officer in pursuit of suspect!
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry, what’s your twenty?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Westbound in the park… suspect is on a
motorcycle… he’s going to come out on Franklin. Hang on–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I want you on 14th in case he turns south.
And I need Seven on the north side to box him in.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And make it fast. My horse is getting
tired.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can you just press the top floor, please.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: The guy on the horse?!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What the hell were you thinking? We had the
guy and you let him get away.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What kind of cop are you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, I know you’re upset. I’m really sorry,
honey. I raced home as quick–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s okay, don’t bother, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m sorry. Thank you for the party.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah. It was great.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Let’s go to bed, Harry. There’s only one
present you have to open tonight.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t move. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on to bed, you don’t have to brush your
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ll just be a second. So what happened
tonight at the office?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I couldn’t believe it. I go back to get this
report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I
answer it–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s the big client in Japan, and it’s the
middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed… this
guy’s having a meltdown–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’d you do, honey?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well I pull out the manual on their setup,
which is the new 680 server…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …and I’m troubleshooting it with them over
the phone… talking to a translator, right, who’s getting half of it
wrong… it was unbelievable… really wild.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It sounds wild. So now you’re a big hero,
right? For fixing their system.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: My husband the hero.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ll be right there, honey. Just a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>on harry</strong>: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed,
snoring softly. A little bit of drool is coming out the side of his
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Happy Birthday, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call
in to give himself up yet? Cause apparently that’s the only way we’re
going to catch the son of a bitch –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay. Here she comes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look at the way the little punk is driving.
He’s all over the place. Look– he hasn’t signalled once.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Goddammit! That’s outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Oh my God! I think that’s my dad!</p>
<p><strong>trent</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So, you wanna play huh? You little–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: That’s it. Get ’im Harry We’ll teach that
little puke not to signal.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Ha! The little prick ditched you! That is so
goddamn funny.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Abu Kaleem Malik.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-
fundamentalist. Linked to numerous car-bombings, that cafe bomb in Rome,
and the 727 out of Lisbon last year. Major player.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Now he’s formed his own splinter faction
called CRIMSON JIHAD.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Guess he thought the other terrorist groups
were too warm and fuzzy for his taste.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: They call him “The Sand Spider”.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Probably because it sounds scary.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it
would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he
was.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’ll get him.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Yes. You will. Harry, I still want you in
charge, even though your cover is blown. Just keep a low profile. I
generally prefer it when my covert operations don’t make the front
page.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, uh… I’ve got to talk to Helen about
this thing with Dana. I’m just going to run in and see if she can get
away for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You want me to just hang– ?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just hang a minute.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: I’ll just hang then, shall I?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Hello Mr. Tasker. Just a second, I’ll
buzz Helen.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. No, I’d like to surprise her. Thanks, I
know where her desk is.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Helen! It’s your mystery man.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Simon? Ohmygod.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello, Simon? It’s all right. There’s no one
around.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You mean right now? I guess so. Okay. I’ll be
right there. Yes. I can’t wait. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Can you cover me for an hour?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Just an hour? You should tell this stud to
take more time.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Will you shutup. I should never have told you
about him.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You look like you got gut-kicked. What’s the
matter? You sick?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He– Helen. Helen– it’s Helen. It’s Helen,
Gib.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Something to do with Helen, is what I’m
getting.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s having an affair.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Congratulations. Welcome to the club.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It can’t be. Not Helen.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Nobody believes it can happen to them.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Same thing happened to me with wife two. I had
no idea until I came home and the house was empty. I mean empty. She
even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge. What kind of person would
think of that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I still don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Relax. Helen still loves you. She just wants
this guy to bang her. It’s nothing serious. You’ll get used to it after
a –</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: What’dya expect Harry? She’s a flesh and blood
woman. And you’re never there. It was only a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: I say we concentrate on work. That’s how I
always got through it whenever my life turned to dogshit. Let’s catch
some terrorists and then you can beat the crap out of them. You’ll feel
better.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Women. Can’t live with ’em. Can’t kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: He’s giving us a blank check on wiretaps. So
I’ve set ’em up on all of Juno’s shipping agents, her clients, and
Faisil made up a list of possible contacts that Crimson Jihad might have
in this country. Now all we can do is wait –</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Is this national security stuff boring you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Put a tap on her phone.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: What’re you talking about? We have that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Helen’s phone. Her office line and the line
at my house.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Okay . . .I have two words to describe that
idea. In. Sane. Unauthorized wiretap is a felony, pard.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day. Don’t
give me that crap. Just put on the taps. Now.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Sure, Harry. I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: So. You came by to see me today?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was in the area, and I thought you might
like to have lunch.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They must’ve just missed me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They said you had to run out.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah. It was a rush thing. They needed some
documents down at the court house. I barely made it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull
day. Did is work out okay?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, sure. Fine. I’ll get some more gravy.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Helen? It’s Simon. Is it safe to talk?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I can’t talk long. Can you meet me for lunch
tomorrow? I must see you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. I suppose so. Where?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: The same place. One o’clock. I have to go
now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I need you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I can’t, honey. I promised Allison I’d go
shopping with her. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Look, Harry. I know this is rough. I felt the
same way the first time it happened to–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Right. So . . . the usual, right? GPS locator,
telemetry burst transmitter, audio transmitter, power supply.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just have is back in two hours.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Okay, she’s turning on Seventeenth. Make a
left, you should see her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There she is.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Give me audio.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Are you sure you weren’t followed?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I kept looking back, like you taught me. I
didn’t see anyone.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Okay. It’s just, things are a bit hot for me
right now. If I get a signal… I may have to leave suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s my job to risk my life, but not yours. I
feel bad about bringing you into this, but you’re the only one I can
trust.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where were you? On a… uh, mission?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert operation. And this
one got a little rough.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Worse than Cairo?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Cairo was a day at the beach next to
this.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Guy’s a spook!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, but for who?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: He could be working her to get to you.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Did you read the papers yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert
operation. See– two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men
in a running shootout, ending at the Marriot…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That was you?!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You recognized my style. See, you’re very
good. You’re a natural at this.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: The guy’s a fake! He’s taking credit for our
moves.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You can trust me completely.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I know. But it would compromise your safety
too much to know certain things.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Right, of course. I was worried when I didn’t
hear from you that night.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s strange. I knew I was in a woman’s
thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Were they trying to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Three of them. Hardly worth talking about.
Two won’t bother me again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And you chased one?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Something came over me, I just had nail him,
no matter what the risk. It was pretty hairy. I thought he had me, a
couple of times. But I really can’t take credit . . .</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You can’t?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. It’s the training. It shapes you into a
lethal instrument. You react without thinking.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: I’m starting to like this guy.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: We still have to kill him, that’s a given.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What is it you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Not here. I’ll call you and we’ll rendezvous
again. We have to leave separately, so we aren’t seen together. For your
safety.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’ll call me then?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yes. Now go.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: He’s a goddamn used car salesman. This just
gets better. Sorry Harry, I know this is painful.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s a great little bar, Amanda, you’d love
it. Beirut’s a great place if you know the city. Listen, this isn’t a
secure line. I’ll tell you all about it when I get back tomorrow… if I
live. Scared? Never! Except of you–</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: –I have to go, baby. A guy’s coming toward
me–</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Simon, look out there. You see that man?
Notice how he’s looking at the cars. He’s called a customer. I know it’s
been a while, but do you remember what you’re supposed to do when we
have a customer?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It wants you too. Feel it vibrate? How about
a little spin?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You gotta jump in. That’s rule number one. It
takes a little practice, but there’s no way around it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: See, it’s not just the car, it’s a total
image. An identity you have to go for. This isn’t some high-tech sports
car… it doesn’t even handle that great. But that’s not the idea, is
it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’re we talking about here? Pussy,
right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well then this is a vital piece of equipment.
Used properly, it can change your life. See, you cruise. No racing. This
ain’t a Ferrari. You check out the scenery, let the scenery check you
out. You got to take it slow. Old cars are like good women… they heat up
fast.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Let’s face it, Harry, the Vette gets ’em wet.
But it’s not enough. If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have
an angle.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And you’ve got one.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s killer. Look at me– I’m not that much to
look at. No really. I can be honest. But I got ’em lining up, and not
just skanks, either. Some are.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So what’s your angle?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Sorry. Trade secret.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure. Set me up and then don’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Okay, just ask yourself. What do women really
want? You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for
years. Stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure.
A hint of danger. I create that for them.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So you’re basically lying your ass off the
whole time? I couldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, think of it as playing a role. It’s
fantasy. You have to work on their dreams. Get them out of their daily
suburban grind for a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Isn’t that hard to keep up, in the long
run?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Doesn’t matter. I like change. You know,
constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it’s one of two more
times, then adios.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Use ’em and lose ’em.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Exactly. The trick is, you gotta pick your
target. They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.
But, I’m telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can
suck- start a leaf-blower.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What about the husbands?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Dickless. If they took care of business, I’d
be out of business, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Those idiots.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You working on someone right now?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I always have a couple on the hook. You know.
There’s one right now, I’ve got her panting like a dog. It’s great.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What does she do?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Some kinda legal secretary of something.
Married to some boring jerk.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: And she could be so hot, if she wanted to be.
She’s like a dying plant that just needs a little water.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But with you, she gets to be hot, right?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Red hot. Her thighs steam.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sooooo… she’s pretty good in bed, then?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hey, slow down you’re gonna miss the
turn!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: See. You and this car were meant for each
other. Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I
like your style. Whattya say? Should we start on the paperwork?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let me think about it. Hold it a day for
me?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Because it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Dinner’s in the warmer. Tell your father I
may be late.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Here’s today’s transcripts. There’s nothing
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Nothing from Simon?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Give me the page.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It skips from page nine to eleven. Where’s
page ten?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Aw, it’s gotta be a typo–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Okay. Here.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Jeez, Harry. Seek help.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Helen. I need your help. Can you meet me
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s serious. That’s all I can say. Just meet
on K Street under the Key Bridge. At eight sharp.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shit! It’s almost eight.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s still at my house.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: The purse is still at the house.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Unit Two? Unit Seven?</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Seven here.</p>
<p><strong>unit two</strong>: This is Two.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Immediate roll. Acquire subject at K Street
and Key Bridge. Vehicle is red-and-white convertible. You have six
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: Roger, One. Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>unit two</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Wait a minute! Are you out of your mind? You
can’t pull agents off a priority surveillance to follow your wife! It’s
gross misappropriation of Sector’s resources, it’s… it’s a breach of
national security.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You copy, Harry? This is too far. You’re losing
it big-time. I have to stop you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Whatya going to do? Tell?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Goddamnit, Harry. This is our butts. So your
life is in the toilet. So your wife is banging a used car salesman. Sure
it’s humiliating. But be a man here–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You tell on me, I tell on you.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Whatya talking? I’m clean as a preacher’s
sheets, babe. Clean as a –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What about that time you trashed a six-week
operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You know about that?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Take Franklin, it’s quicker.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You don’t have any pictures though, do ya.
Huh?</p>
<p><strong>morton</strong>: Two here. Subject is southbound on Key
Bridge. A man and a woman in the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Roger’s two.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Now don’t be alarmed… but if I’m spotter, it
would be best if they don’t see you. You should keep your head down
until we’re out of the city.</p>
<p><strong>morton</strong>: The woman has her head in the guy’s lap.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Roger, two. One to Condor, do you have
visual?</p>
<p><strong>condor</strong>: This is Condor. We have the ball, repeat… we
have a good lock-up on I.R.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: INFRARED VIEW of the Vette, from the
helicopter’s FLIR system. The greenish, image-intensified view of the
car is like daylight.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: My place in the city is too hot right now. So
is the penthouse in New York. But this place is secure.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: To our assignment.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What is it you need me to do?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Helen, I want you to be my wife.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m married!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be
married. They’ll be looking for a man traveling alone.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We’re going to Paris?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Helen, there’s a double agent in my outfit… I
don’t know who. There’s no one I can trust. Except you. Can you get
away? Just for two days.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know. I have to think…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Here. Sit down. Be comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Okay. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You are incredibly brave. I have to remind
myself the fear you must be feeling. I’ve lived like this for years, so
I’m used to it. Every day when I get up, I think it might be my last.
But it makes you appreciate life. And the moment. Because that may be
all you have.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: To pull this cover story off, we have to look
exactly like two people who are intimate with each other. The enemy can
spot a fake easily.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You see what I mean? That reaction would give
us away in a second. Try to relax.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s just that… it’s been sixteen years since
anyone but Harry did that, I–</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Relax. There, that’s better. Let yourself
slip into the role.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: There you go. That’s right…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: NO! Stop! Get off me RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: If not for me, do it for democracy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I said SIT DOWN. Who do you work for?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I’m a legal
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Of course. Mrs. Tasker. And what were you
going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal? Taking
dictation?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He said he was an American agent.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How long have you been a member of his
faction?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know anything about a faction. I just
met Simon… or whatever his name is… a couple of weeks ago. I barely know
him.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: That’s not what it looked like when we found
you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How did you meet him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: About two weeks ago I was at the mall, having
coffee…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Keep this for me. I can’t afford to be taken
with it. National security is at stake. I’ll contact you if a can. Okay?
Oh–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I should have gone to the police, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: But you didn’t. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know. I guess… I wanted to see what
would happen.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What did happen?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Three days later, he called me. He told me to
meet him at Overlook Park.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Thank you. You saved my life. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Helen.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You can call me Simon. You’re very brave to
do this… You opened it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I just glances inside.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Then you know.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why did you continue to see him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He needed my help.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not because you were attracted to him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You weren’t attracted to him at all?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, maybe a little.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No! Never!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: So, it was your first time.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I wasn’t cheating!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Harry? What can I say about Harry? He’s a
sales rep for a computer company.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Would you say he was boring, then?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yeah. I suppose he is.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: So sex with him isn’t exactly making your flag
wave anymore.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s none of your goddamn business! What
kind of questions are these?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I
suggest you cooperate. If we want to know the most intimate details of
your life, you’d better tell us.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: My husband is a good man.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: But he’s not exactly ringing your bell lately,
right? I mean–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let me handle this part. Do you mind? Why did
you go to Carlos’ hideout?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to
pose as him wife.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And you agreed?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know. I guess I needed something…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What did you need?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I needed to feel alive. I wanted to do
something… outrageous. And… I don’t know… it felt good to be needed. To
be trusted. To be special.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There’s so much I wanted to do in this life,
and it’s like I haven’t done any of it. And the sand’s running out of
the hourglass. I want to be able to look back and say: See! I did that.
It was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and I fucking did it! And
I frankly don’t give a shit if you understand this or not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This Simon. Did you sleep with him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: She’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You didn’t have sexual relations with
him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is
going to take a really long time. And I have to get home to my
family.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Let me out of her! Right now!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Answer the question–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I didn’t sleep with him! You hear me, you
chickenshit bastards–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Everyone tries. It’s unbreakable.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: She could be telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait! Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only
one more question.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you still love your husband?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Louder please.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I love him. I have always loved him and I
will always love him. Can I go home, please?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There is only one solution to your problem,
Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Oh shit. Harry… what’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m giving her an assignment. I am offerring
you a choice. If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go
back to your normal life. If not, you will go to federal prison, and
your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone. Your like
will be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, gee thanks. Mmmm, let me see–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes or no.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What do you think? Of course yes! What’s
involved?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You will be contacted with the
assignment.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: My husband can’t know about this.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No one must know! Especially him. You must
appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing. The security of
this nation depends on it. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Think carefully. You will be lying to the man
you love. The person who trusts you the most.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I can do it!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The code name of your contact will be Boris.
Your code name will be–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Natasha?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Doris.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeeaoowww!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You son of a bitch. Did you really think you
could elude us forever, Carlos?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Wait! You got the wrong guy. My name’s Simon.
Look, just let me go. There’s no need to kill me. I haven’t seen
your–</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: – face. Shit! Shit!!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s you! Hey, you still interested in that
Vette at all?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You can drop it now, Carlos. The game is over.
Your career as an inter-national terrorist is too well documented.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No… I sell cars. That’s all! Not even foreign
cars. Nothing international, I swear. I’m no terrorist. Everything I
said was a lie… you have to believe me. I’m actually a complete coward.
If I ever even saw a gun I’d–</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: – faint. Aahhh! Don’t kill me. I’m not a spy.
I’m nothing. I’m navel lint. I have to lie to women to get laid. And I
don’t score much. It’s pathetic. See, look… would a spy pee himself?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Beat it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No. Soon as I turn you’ll shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Please don’t. You can have the car for
free–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Take off, dipshit!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We should pick up visual at the next
light.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Morning, boss.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Harry, this report on last night’s operation
is the thinnest piece of crap I’ve ever seen from you. I’m sure you
won’t mind giving me a little more detail on why all these assets were
deployed.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Absolutely. But can it wait? I’m on a
critical surveillance right now.</p>
<p><strong>harry’s pov through scope</strong>: Trent, on the Yamaha with
Dana on the back, rides through the intersection up ahead. Dana bops to
the sound coming over her walkman headphones as Trent zips between cars.
Gib makes the turn, pulling in behind them at a distance.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Harry. Is there anything you want to tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Not that I can think of.</p>
<p><strong>trilby</strong>: Harry? You know we never fire anybody.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: We’re dead, right? So… where’d you put the
transmitter?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In her Walkman. It’s the one thing I knew
she’d be taking.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: You! Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Oh my Gooooood.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There are going to be some changes Dana.
You’re going to start following some rules. And I’m going to be there to
see that you do.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re going to stay in school. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Why? So I can wind up like you? What’s the
point?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did I tell you about the time we first
met?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You were quite young at the time. All wet and
still attached to your mom by a cord. You opened your eyes and looked
right at me. And I knew then I would always love you with all my
heart.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Somewhere along the way I got lost, honey. I
forgot about what was really important. I’m sorry pump– I mean–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dana, regarding this singing–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You were pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>harry/ dana</strong>: I’ve been waiting so long To be where
I’m going In the sunshine of your looooove</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Dad, how come you know the words?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was
exactly your age.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Unbelievable! Trent told me he wrote it. He’s
history.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where are you off to young lady?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I have a book report.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So last night was pretty exciting, huh?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What? Oh, the flat tire? Yeah, I thought the
damn towtruck was never going to get there.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>metallic voice</strong>: Doris?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Listen carefully. Go to the Hotel Marquis in
one hour. Pick up an envelope marked Doris at the front desk. And dress
sexy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Get going!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Uh… well, okay then. You sound terrible. I’ll
run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure,
no problem. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Allison is sick in bed. I have to go over
there, honey.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure, hon.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You’ve reached a new low with this one. I can’t
believe you’re crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why not? You think I can afford a suite like
that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: No no. Do it slowly. Very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you have an envelope for Doris?</p>
<p><strong>metallic voice</strong>: Listen. You are a prostitute named
Michelle. Go to the room. A man will be there. He is a suspected arms
dealer.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do I have to… you know– ?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No. He has particular tastes. He likes to
watch. You will say his regular girl, Carla, is sick. If he likes you,
he will tell you what to do. You must plant the bug near the telephone,
by the bed, before you leave. If you do not accomplish your mission, the
deal is off.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Step into the light.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m Michelle. Carla’s sick. She thought you
might like me, so –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let me do the talking. You are very pretty.
You may start by unzipping your dress.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No no. Do it slowly. Very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now slip the dress down… slowly.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now slide the nylons off one by one.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m not wearing any.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s good. Now the panties.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now turn, cheri, in the moonlight. Let your
body flow like water.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now dance for me. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let your hands be a lover’s hands on your own
skin as you move. Yes, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now, lie on the bed and close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Keep them closed. Do not open them.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I thought you only liked to watch.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Harry– ?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s got nothing to do with this. It’s me you
want, right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let the hooker go. She’s not important.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Harry, be quiet. Let me handle this.</p>
<p><strong>lead terrorist</strong>: Shutup, both of you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Listen, you don’t need him, he’s nothing.
He’s a sales rep for a computer company, really–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That was unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What were you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You wouldn’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>terrorist leader</strong>: Talk again, I kill you.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Hello, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Juno. I wish I could say it’s a pleasure to
see you again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Who’s your little friend?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m Helen Tasker. Harry’s my husband. And you
are?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: So now it’s Tasker? Not Renquist?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look, Harry’s not part of this. He’s just a
sales rep.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: No, my dear, he is a federal agent. He killed
two of my colleagues the other night.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, you don’t understand, we’ve been married
for 15 years–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, Juno, this is just some whacko hooker I
met in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Harry, what’s the matter with you? Tell them
the truth. We’re married, we have a daughter–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know what this crazy bitch is on. You
should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get
this?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Something before take-off?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oooowww!! That hurt. You biii–</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: She was telling the truth, wasn’t she Harry?
She really doesn’t know. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Who is this woman?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: His wife.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: His wife? Good. Bring them.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Incredible, aren’t they? Warrior figures from
the Persian Empire of Darius the First, around 500 BC. I call them “The
Four Horsemen”.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: They’re absolutely priceless.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Do you know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can you give me a clue? It could be a water
heater for all I know.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Do you know why you have been brought
here?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: N-no.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: So that this man can verify to the world that
Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How can Harry do that? He’s a salesman for
chrissakes.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: If we were wrong about him… then the last
thing you see will be your blood spraying in his face.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is a Soviet MIRV-Six, from an SS-22N
launch vehicle. The warhead contains 14.5 kilos of enriched uranium,
with a plutonium trigger. The nominal yield is 10 kilotons. Release her
and I’ll cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What can I say? I’m a spy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You bastard!! You lying son of a bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m sorry, honey.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t call me honey! You don’t ever get to
call me honey again. You understand?! You pig!</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Here you go, dear.</p>
<p><strong>akbar</strong>: Abu! Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You bugged me?!!</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: We’ve lost the signal.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Son of a bitch! Where?</p>
<p><strong>faisil</strong>: It’s an island in the Keys, out past
Marathon.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Miami TCA, we are on final.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Call our DEA contact, tell him I want those
choppers flight-ready the second we land.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …and I can verify that they have the arming
box and all equipment necessary to detonate the four warheads. This is
absolutely the real thing, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: You have killed our women and children,
bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and dare to call us
terrorists–</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: – But now the Oppressed have been given a
mighty sword, to strike back at their enemies. Unless the US pulls all
military forces out of the Persian Gulf area, immediately and forever,
Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major US city each week until these
demands are met…</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: … First one weapon will be detonated on this
uninhabited island as a demonstration of Crimson Jihad’s power and our
willingness to be humanitarian. However, if there demands are not–</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Battery, Abu.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Get another one, you moron!</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: This is Samir. See if you can guess his
specialty.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oral hygiene?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s going on, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Samir is just going to ask Harry a few
questions. See, we’re not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now,
Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry,
here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15
years. So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: This will help.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know, you should swab that with alcohol.
I might get an infection.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: I’ll return when this has taken effect. Then
we’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why are you helping these raving
psychotics.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Because they’re very well-funded raving
psychotics, and I’m getting a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: You think I care about their cause? Or yours?
Not at all. See, America is on top now . . . but so was Rome, once. All
civilizations crumble. One nation succeeding over another. What does it
mean in the long run? The only important thing is to live well. And…
living well takes money.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re damaged goods, lady.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Did you tell her about us, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There is no us, you psychotic bitch.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Sure. Say that now.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Thanks for everything, Harry. It was good
while it lasted.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Now just keep your knees together, and you’ll
be fine.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Something you obviously have a hard time
doing!</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Hold that thought.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There was nothing. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What did he give you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth
agent.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It makes you tell the truth?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is it working yet?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ask me a question I would normally lie
to.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Are we going to die?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’d say it’s working.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They’ll either torture us to death, shoot us
in the head, or leave us until the bomb goes off.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Okay, okay. I get it. How long have you been
a spy, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: 17 years.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: My God. Have you had to… have sex with other
women in the line of duty?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t take those assignments.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What about Juno?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s really a fox, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did you pork her Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. But I wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig
Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Is there anything you would like to tell me
before we start?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. I’m going to kill you pretty soon.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: I see. How exactly?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Well, I thought I’d break your neck, then use
you as a human shield, then kill the guard with that knife there on your
table and take his gun.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: And what makes you think you can do all
that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Because I picked the lock on these
handcuffs…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: God, you have great legs.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Harry… snap out of it!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Go it, baby.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Tell me something before this stuff wears off
and you start lying again.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you still love me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: As much as you used to?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Much more.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It wore off.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They found the bodies. Come on–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I married Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In ninety minutes a pillar of holy fire will
rise at this place as a sign to out enemies. It is done…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now no man can stop us. We are set on our
course. No force can stop us… … we’re cool, we’re badass, blah blah.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If we’re on an island, why are they using
trucks?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We must be in the Florida Keys . . . the
Overseas Highway connects the islands to the mainland.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: So there’s no border, no customs. They can
just drive anywhere they want . . . there’s nothing to stop them . .
.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just us.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Go down there and kill everybody, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait here. If you have to use this, use it.
Don’t choke. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>flies out of her hands.</strong>: It falls to the metal steps
and hits– Going off. B-B-BLAM! The burst kills two more terrorists, and–
The Mac-10 cartwheels and hits further down. ANOTHER BURST. Another
terrorist is splattered.</p>
<p><strong>angle looking up, underwater, as harry hits the water
and</strong>: dives down. An instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across
the surface above him. Harry kicks hard, trying to swim beyond the
inferno above him so he can surface.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh my God. Harry.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: My condolences to the window.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Not now. We may need a hostage.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Let’s go, Suzy Homemaker.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: I thought this look like your work.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s go. I’ll brief you in the air.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: –you tell the son of bitch this is Bright Boy
Alert. Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert. And I need a patch of the White House
ASAP. That’s right–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: … the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a
twenty mile radius. Anybody that can’t make the minimum safe distance we
need an airlift on, immediately–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about
12 minutes. They’re on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Get ’em. I’ll brief them on the way in.</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Like one?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: … well get the Highway Patrol to go through the
streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers. Just the basics…
get away from windows, don’t look at it… yeah–</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Roger, Mike Three Five, you are cleared to
engage. Be advised, your targets have Stingers and light machine
guns.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Copy that, Bright Boy command. Tally ho.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Recommend you use your Mavericks to take out
the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: They won’t set off those nukes will they?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Negative, Mike Three Five. That’s a negative.
Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good shooting, Mike Three Five. I need you to
stay on station. Okay. You see that limo?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You… bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>juno</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Get lower, goddamnit! Right now!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Any minute now.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: It’s show time. Don’t look at the flash. Do not
look at the flash.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’re safe here.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That was some kiss.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s my husband.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Malik’s copter landed twenty minutes ago in
Miami. He’s on the top of a high-rise downtown. SWAT’s on the scene, and
I got the cops sealing off the area. He renezvous’d there with about a
dozen more faction members. They’re barricaded on the twentieth floor.
Harry, they have a hostage. It’s Dana.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My Dana!?</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: They must have grabbed her during the night… we
didn’t know. Sorry, Harry, I–</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Harry! We’ll get her out! We have a man inside
already . . . Harry!! Aw, shit… here we go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I need to borrow this thing for a few
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Excuse me . . . sir?!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: Force Comm cleared you to give us total
cooperation, right?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Yessir, but . . .</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: That’s coming right from the President,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Yessir. Uh . . . sir? You’re going to have to
sign for the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: I’ll sign for it. You got a pen? Here, he’ll
sign for it.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: I’d like to remind you that it has been ten
years since you were actually in one of these.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If I break it they can take it out of my
pay.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: It’ll be fine. He’s got hundreds of hours in
Harriers. Joint-ops, cross-training and all that.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Harry can fly anything.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: He’s a little rusty. It’s like riding a bicycle
. . . you never forget. Uh . . . I’d seek shelter!</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: He’s got it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell Helen what’s going on. Tell her I love
her. And ask the pilot where the button for the 20mm cannon is– never
mind. I found it.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Tape is rolling.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: This is a communique from Crimson Jihad. You
have heard from your own expert. You have seen the Holy fire with your
own eyes. Do not force us to destroy this city. And do not try to use
force against us. I can trigger this bomb instantly. All I have to do is
turn that key… … and five million of your people will die.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What key?</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: That key right there!</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Someone has stolen the key!</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: You shoot me, this’ll fall.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Don’t come any closer. I’ll drop it! I swear
to God.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: If you drop it, I will have no reason not to
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>malik</strong>: Come on, child. Give me the key. Don’t you
want to live? I give you my word.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: No way you whacko.</p>
<p><strong>rising into view, like a gargoyle from hell, is the
harrier.</strong>: It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few
feet outside. The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as Harry
hits the 20mm nose-cannon.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let go baby! I’ve got you! Daddy’s got
you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t touch the stick, baby.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi, pumpkin.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: … you should have seen your father, standing
there all covered with spaghetti sauce. He looked like such a dope.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I told the guy— I told the guy, this isn’t
even my order.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I seem to remember something about a history
project that’s due tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: Dad. You just think you know everything, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Boris and Doris?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>gib</strong>: So, what’s the scoop, team? You see your
contact yet?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Not yet. But we’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Dance?</p>
