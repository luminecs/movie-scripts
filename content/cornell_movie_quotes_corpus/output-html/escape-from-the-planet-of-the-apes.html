<p><strong>final screenplay</strong>: October 28, 1970</p>
<p><strong>from black screen</strong>: SHOCK-CUT TO EXTREME CLOSEUP:</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 1</strong>: We made it.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: So far. But one thing i8 for certain.
Whoever wins the war, there’ll be no place on Earth for us.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 3</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: Probably to our death. But just
possibly –</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: The fools…they’ve finally destroyed
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 1</strong>: My God, the earth is no more.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 3</strong>: And we’ve escaped.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: We have, if we survive the shock
wave.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: The shock must have … unbalanced the
mechanism. I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: We’ve been forced out of orbit.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 1</strong>: We’re descending.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 3</strong>: But where?</p>
<p><strong>earth time</strong>: 1973</p>
<p><strong>ship time</strong>: 3955</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Tower, this is Red Baron Five. I have an
object beached on the tide- line – uh – seemingly one of our spacecraft.
Coordinates are southeast corner of sector Alpha Charlie. Relay this to
appropriate recovery forces. I have enough fuel to orbit for forty- five
minutes. Please alert Red Baron Ops and I’ll squawk Channel Two for
radar fix.</p>
<p><strong>duty officer</strong>: Rescue, we have Red Baron Five report
of possible spacecraft washed ashore in southeast sector Alpha Charlie.
Immediately launch two choppers to effect pickup and recovery. Base
Radar will vector them to the location.</p>
<p><strong>duty officer</strong>: The Colonel, please.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I didn’t even know we had anything up.
Okay, I’ll call Washington. Damn!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No serial number? … Well, it may have been
burnt out on re-entry. … No, neither did I. I’ll check with Deputy
Director, NASA, and call you back.</p>
<p><strong>deputy director</strong>: General Brody, I’m telling you… We
have no spacecraft up.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You’re telling me that what never went up
can’t come down. And I’m telling you it just has. And now I’m going to
tell the President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Let us hope and pray that you are right,
General. But I think we should be alert to a remoter possibility: that
the Russians retrieved one of our missing space- ships and remanned it
with astronauts who have now accidentally splashed down in our own
territorial waters. If they’re alive, you may tell Colonel Winthrop at
El Palomar to welcome them with caution. Whether they’re alive or not,
have NASA go over that ship with whatever’s the scientific equivalent of
a fine tooth comb. And until we know more, I want a full security
clampdown on the entire operation. You understand me, General. This is
not for the networks.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: We are being pulled.</p>
<p><strong>frogman’s voice</strong>: How the hell do you hold onto this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>frogman’s voice</strong>: Some Frogman you are.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 1</strong>: They speak our language. At least they
have intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut 2</strong>: Then at least let us conceal our
intelligence from our captors. Our safety may lie in silence.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Welcome, gentlemen.</p>

<p><strong>t. credit</strong>: DIRECTED BY:Colonel and Aide emerge from
building heading towards guardhouse.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Did you call the Zoo?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Yes, sir. We’re in luck. The sick bay’s almost
empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a
depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public. They’ll be
quarantined. If they want medical attention, it’s available on the spot.
And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the
morning. General Brody’s very pleased.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Me, too. Can’t have a lot of monkeys making
messes in the Guardhouse. Have we fed them? Like raw steak or
something?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all
apes, are vegetarian, sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Good God.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: They suggested oranges.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Excuse me. I didn’t mean to disturb…. What
am I saying?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: They’re…pretending to dress.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What d’you mean, pretending? They are
dressing. Where’d they get those clothes?</p>
<p><strong>marine m.p.</strong>: They brought them with them, sir. In a
suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Suit….? Greg, give them their oranges.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Arrange prisoner escort for 16:30
hours…</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: We’re sending them to the Zoo
Infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: They’ll have company. There’s a gorilla in
the next cage.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Now why the hell did it do that?</p>
<p><strong>keeper</strong>: Have it your own way, mate.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I’m not his mate. I’m yours.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Zira, please control yourself. I think
they’re trying to be kind.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: This cage stinks of gorilla.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Cornelius – where are we? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I know where we are. I know what has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: In some fashion – and I lack the intellect to
know precisely how – we have traveled from Earth’s future into Earth’s
past.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: But we saw Earth destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And Earth will be destroyed – just as we saw
it. Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a….backward
disturbance in time – did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after
the shock wave hit our ship? – and we have returned to Earth almost two
thousand years before its destruction. That is another reason for
keeping silence. Our human captors would not be edified to know that,
one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because
of an Ape war of aggression.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Apes, at this instant in time, cannot yet
talk. For the moment, we should follow their example.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: The driver brought e report from the Air
Base. The usual imitatory behavior … mimicking salutes … hand-shaking …
sitting on chairs … eating off plates with knives … but–</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What, Lewis?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: There was a sort of carpetbag in the
ship.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: With food?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: No – clothes. Stevie, they changed into
them.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: What are they doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Security. Join the Marines and see the Zoo
…</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Good morning, Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Hi, Dr. Dixon…..Dr. Branton.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The female’s a bit uppity, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Okay, I’ll be careful. We’ll start with the
Wisconsin Multiphasic.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Go easy, Stevie.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: They look pretty docile.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Yes, but don’t take any chances.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Unless the spacecraft was remotely
controlled, they must have been conditioned to press at least some of
the right buttons. They can’t be morons. The female first, Arthur. And
set up Tic-Tac-Toe.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: She seems to be pretty smart. All right –
let’s make it difficult.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: They haven’t eaten this morning?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Not a bite….just as you ordered.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Good. We’ll go for the banana…</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: Why doesn’t she take it?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Because I loathe and detest bananas.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Zira!</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Help me get her away. I’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Zira, are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Dr. Milo, please don’t call my wife
mad.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I did not call her mad. I merely asked her if
she was. And I repeat the question. Are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I hate deceit.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: There is a time for truth and a time, not for
lies, but for silence. Until we know who i8 our friend and who our
enemy–</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: And how in the name of God are we to know
that, unless we communicate? We can speak. So I spoke.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We can also listen</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: To a lot of psychiatric small talk –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And we can watch …</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: A display of primitive apparatus –</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Primitive? Its prehistoric. It couldn’t test
the intelligence of a newt.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Zira, calm yourself –</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I am calm.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Stop arguing. It’s too late for that.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Use your heads and start thinking. Now that
they know we can speak, how much shall we tell them? ow–</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Milo-o-o!</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: We shall want a full autopsy …</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: With particular emphasis on the cranial and
oral areas.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.
Then send him to Taxidermy. He’s a museum piece.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I’d better do this alone.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: We mean you no harm.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Do you understand? We mean you no harm.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: But he isn’t us. He’s your own kind.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: He’s a gorilla.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I mean he’s of your race. He’s an Ape. Look.
You don’t have to be afraid. We’ve put him in chains and under sedation.
Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I should. I’ve been doing it half my life to
Humans.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Humans?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I’m a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: So am I. And I mean you no harm.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We know that.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira –
my wife.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: My name is Lewis – Lewis Dixon .</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Nobody’s going to believe it.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Believe what?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: That primitive apes can talk.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Primitive?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I mean that in our ‘primitive’ civilization,
apes just don’t talk. I mean I think it’s important that, when our
‘primitive’ security precautions are lifted, the first time you say
something in public you should talk to what we ‘primitively’ call the
Right People.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: May I say something personal?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Please</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I like you.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I did from the beginning.</p>
